      [2024] KEHC 10568 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at KakamegaFamily Appeal 13 of 2021SC Chirchir, JAugust 26, 2024N THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF PETER AYUGUNGAIRAMILLAH NGAIRA---------------------------------------APPELLANTVERSUSSTANELY SHIVACHI NGAIRA--------------------RESPONDENTBetweenMillah NgairaAppellantandStanely Shivachi NgairaRespondent((  Being an appeal from the Ruling of   Zachariah Joseph Nyakundi (SPM) and delivered on the 16th day of September 2021 in Butali SPM SUCCESION Cause no. 77 of 2018 ))Judgment1.The Appellant and the Respondent are Administrators of the Estate of peter Ayugu Ngaira( Deceased). On 9 / 2 /2018 the respondent filed summons for confirmation of Grant and in response, the Appellant filed an objection2.The hearing proceeded by way of oral hearing and at the conclusion of the trial, the court delivered a ruling in which the trial magistrate ordered as follows:1.That county surveyor do visit land parcel No. S/Kabras/Bushu/1518 to survey the suit land with a view to ascertain the acreage.2.That upon such survey, the suit land be sub- divided among the two houses in equal shares3.That upon such division the administrators do file jointly a fresh Application for confirmation of Grant.3.It is the above orders that has given rise to this Appeal.Memorandum of Appeal4.The Appellant has set out the following grounds:1.That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by entertaining the Respondent’s summons for confirmation dated 9thFebruary 2018 when the co- tenant Manoah Ngaira was still alive.a.That the learned magistrate erred in both law and in fact by failing to take into account and acknowledge and find that land parcel number S/KABRAS/BUSHU/1519 was part and parcel of the estate(Homestead)b.That the learned trial magistrate of the subordinate court erred in ordering the county land surveyor to visit and survey land parcel number S/KABRAS/BUSHU/1518 when he had no jurisdiction.c.That the learned trial magistrate of the subordinate court erred in both fact and in law in unreasonably, injudiciously and wrongly finding that land parcel number S/KABRAS/BUSHU/1518 should be equally shared between the two houses.d.That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by totally disregarding the objector and her witness’s evidence.e.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by misunderstanding and misrepresenting evidence adduced in court and proceeding to make ruling.5.The appeal was canvassed by way of written submission.Appellant’s submissions6.It is the Appellant’s submissions that the trial court ignored land parcel No. S/ kabras / Bushu/1519 and only directed the distribution of parcel No. S/Kabras/ Bushu/ 1518.7.It is further submitted that the trial court ought not to have entertained the Application for confirmation of grant as the same was touching on the principle of transmission and survivorship , which principles fall under the purview of the Environment and land Court.8.It is further submitted that considering that a portion of 1.43 hectares had already been hived off from parcel No. 1518 and given to the respondent’s sister, then this acreage should be discounted from the portion due to the Respondent.Respondent’s submissions9.It is the respondent’s submissions that the only property forming the subject matter for appeal and proceedings in the lower court is land parcel S/KABRAS/BUSHU/1518.10.The respondent further states that on 13/9/2016 the high court gave orders that a new grant of representation be issued in the joint name of Stanley Shivachi Ngaira and Millah Ngaira and that the parties were given the liberty to file summons for confirmation of the grant.11.On the order for survey given by the trial court , the respondent submits that the same was necessary as the Appellant had understated the size of parcel No. 1518.12.It is further submitted that the succession proceedings were necessary as the parcel was owned by the deceased and the Appellant’s brother, Manoah and that the two were holding the parcel in trust for their respective families; that pursuant to the provisions of 91(5) of theland registration Act, the family of the deceased was entitled to half share of the suit property.The Evidence13.The first witness was the Appellant herein . She told the court that her father had two wives; that the deceased was her half -brother; She was from the 2ndhouse while the deceased was from the 1sthouse.14.She further stated that following a decision of the court it was decided that the suit property was to be registered in the names of the deceased and her brother, one Manoa Shivachi.15.The Appellant further testified that her said brother, manaoh, suffers from a mental disability and when the deceased died , the respondent took advantage of his disability and divided the suit property into the current portions.16.On cross- examination, she stated that that her brother Manoah was given 13 acres , which they sold; that she had a power of Attorney giving her the right to represent her brother in the said sale.17.The 2ndwitness identified himself as a relative of the family. He told the court that he was aware that the suit property was to be shared between the two houses.18.PW3 testified that he was a relative of the family. He told the court that the family homestead stands on the suit property and it was to be divided equally between the two families.19.Pw5 told the court that one Jedidah, the sister to the deceased was also given a portion from the suit property.The Respondent’s case20.The first defence witness was Francis Ayuku, the deceased’s son. He told the court that the suit property was a sub- division of parcel No. 100; that the sub- division was done following a dispute which was resolved by the court in the year 1978; that it was ordered that the suit property be held jointly between the deceased and Manoa. He further stated that it was his grandfather who sub- divided the land to parcels numbers 1519 and 1518; that parcel No. 1517 belonging to Manoa was sold by the Appellant, and that parcel No. 1518 was to be shared between the two houses.21.DW2 was the respondent herein , and the son of the deceased. He told the court that the homestead stood on the suit property; that the size has since reduced as a portion was given to his sister. On cross- examination he stated that the equal sharing of 1518 was pursuant to an order of the court.Determination22.The role of this court, as the first Appellate court is to review the evidence afresh , evaluate and arrive at its own findings , without necessarily ignoring the conclusions of the trial court. ( Ref: Gitobu Imanyara & 2 others vs the AG (2016) e KLR.23.From the onset , it is imperative to point out that the proceedings herein relate to the estate of the , peter Ayugu Ngaira( Deceased) . The Appellant’s assertion that the proceedings ought to be in relation to her father’s Estate , one Joseph Ngaira is therefore misconceived . The Appellant is also a co- Administrator of the Estate of the deceased herein and for her to state that proceedings ought to relate to any other person other than the deceased herein is odd, insincere and if genuine, is devoid of any seriousness on her part.24.I will proceed to address the grounds of Appeal in the order in which they have been pleaded.Whether the trial court ought to have entertained the succession proceedings when the co- tenant was still alive ( Ground 1)25.The dispute herein revolves around the whole of that property known as S/ Kabras/ Bushu/1518. The title deed of the property shows that the registered owners were the peter Ayugu Ngaira , the deceased herein and Manoah Ngaira. Upon the demise of peter Ayugu Ngaira , the present proceedings in respect of his Estate was commenced.26.It came out, during the proceedings , that Manoah is mentally incapacitated and the Appellant herein represent him, under a power of Attorney.27.The Appellant has not addressed the issue of transmission and survivorship directly in her submissions, save to state that the trial court should have left the matter to the Environment and Land court.28.Firstly, the survivorship principle was never raised in during trial. It is being for the first time in this Appeal. This court cannot therefore address itself on an issue that had not been raised from the beginning. Secondly , there is nothing to indicate whether the owners were joint tenants or tenants- in- common. The Title Deed of the suit property was issued in the year 1995, under the then RegisteredLand Act, cap 300, laws of Kenya ( now repealed). Section 101( 1) of the said Act provided that“ An instrument made in favour of two or more persons and the registration giving effect to it shall show interalia whether those persons are joint proprietors or proprietors in common”29Further there was no instrument of transfer submitted in evidence. The title deed ( page 152 of the record of Appeal ) and the a copy of the register( page 73 of the record) are both silent on the nature of tenancy.30.Thus even if this court was to consider this issue there is no evidence at all that the deceased and Manoah Ngaira were joint tenants so as to invoke the application of the survivorship principle.31.In the circumstances , proceedings in respect of the estate of the deceased herein during the life time of the co- proprietor was validly admitted and determined by the trial court. I make this conclusion , based on the fact that in the absence of any evidence on ownership based on joint- tenancy then the correct presumption, in my view is that the property was owned on the basis of Tenancy -in- common. Consequently the heirs of the deceased were entitled to take out succession proceedings in the deceased’s presumed 50% share in the suit property.Whether parcel No. S/ Kabras / Busgu/ 1519 should have been treated as part of the Estate.32.A perusal of the high court Ruling in in succession cause No. 557 of 2012 show that the main contention was that the respondent herein had misrepresented the suit property as belonging solely to the deceased while the true position was that the Appellant’s brother , Manoah Ngaira was a joint owner. The high court returned a verdict in her favour , cancelled the grant that had been issued to the Respondent alone , the certificate of confirmation arising therefrom and ordered any of them to file fresh summons for confirmation of grant.33.Thus parcel No. 1519 was not a subject of the objection proceedings at the high court . The high court ( Justice Mwita) I believe ,appointed the Appellant herein as a co- administrator to take care of the interest of her mentally challenged brother..34.The Appellant’s contention in the lower court was that parcel No. 1518 was a property of her late father’s Estate , one Joseph Ngaira and that the deceased herein had no share in it; that her nephew, the respondent, had benefited more from their late grandfather’s estate and should therefore cede the whole of parcel No. 1518 to the Appellant’s brother, manaoa.35.This , in my view would amount to inviting this court to determine issues belonging to the estate of the Appellant’s father , John Ngaira , and not the deceased herein. Neither the trial court nor this court could determine issues to do with the senior Ngaira’s Estate as their mandate was and is confined to determining matters touching on the estate of the deceased herein.36.Further , if the Appellant had any other claim against the deceased Estate outside of parcel No. 1518, that ought to be treated as a separate claim against the estate and which should be submitted to the Environment and Land court for adjudication.37.It must be remembered that the mandate of a succession court is to deal purely with the Assets and liabilities of the deceased ‘ Estate and anything attendant to the estate at the point of succession proceedings or anything that may arise later in respect thereof. Anything else outside of this mandate is outside the purview of the succession court.38.In effect the Appellant’s contention that the trial court ought to have treated parcel No. 1519 as part of and subjected to the succession proceedings is misplaced.39.The appellant has also argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to order the Land surveyor to survey the suit property with a view to ascertaining the size.40.Section 48(1) of the Act was amended by the enactment of the Magistrates’ Court Act,Act No. 26 of 2015(hereinafter referred to as ‘the new Act’). Section 23 of the new Act repealed the said Section 48(1) of the Act and substituted it with the following new subsection: -’23.TheLaw of Succession Actis amended, by repealing section 48(1) and substituting therefor the following new subsection –1.Notwithstanding any other written law which limits jurisdiction, but subject to the provisions of section 49, a magistrate shall have jurisdiction to entertain any application and to determine any dispute under this Act and pronounce such decrees and make such orders therein as may be expedient in respect of any estate the gross value of which does not exceed the pecuniary limit prescribed under section 7 (1) of theMagistrates’ Courts Act, 2015.’ (Emphasis added).41.The trial court ordered for the survey for purposes of determining the size of the suit property to facilitate the distribution of the estate . It is part of the tasks undertaken by succession court , where necessary, in the process of determining issues succession. This complain is without meritWhether the trial court erred in ordering equal distribution between the two houses.42.The Appellant faults the trial court for ordering for equal distribution of property, between the two houses, arguing that if such distribution was to be effected , the size of 1.43 hectares that had been allegedly excised from parcel No. 1518 should be included before distribution.43.From the testimony of the Appellant, this portion had been hived off before the registration of the suit property in the name of the deceased and Appellant’s brother.44.To the extent that no claim had been instituted and the alleged portion of 1.43 hectares portion reclaimed, it never became the property of the deceased and Manoa. Consequently the trial court , having been presented with no evidence of what portions was the property held , the order on Equal distribution was valid. I have no reason to fault the trial court in this regard.Other orders45.Under Rule 73 of the probate and Administration Rules this court is empowered to make any order in pursuit of justice. This court therefore find it necessary to make a determination of some issues not raised in the appeal but which I consider necessary to conclusively dispose off this matter conclusively.46.I have taken note of the trial court’s last two final orders. The second last order is that:  (ii) ‘Upon survey , the suit land be divided among the two houses in equal shares”. The contest herein was not between any two houses but the deceased’s estate and the Appellant , Manaoh Ngaira. The distribution therefore should be between the Appellant and the estate of the deceased herein.47.The last order stated that : “ That upon such division the administrators do file jointly a fresh application for confirmation of grant.48.The trial court had taken oral evidence on the current on the matter and had determined all the issues, including the mode of distribution. A fresh application for confirmation of grant is therefore unnecessary. It may give rise to another unnecessary trial if the parties bring up the same or other contentions. For this reason this court finds it necessary to set aside the two orders and substituted them with appropriate ones.In the end I hereby proceed to make the following orders:a).The Appeal herein is without merit and it is hereby dismissed.b).Order 2 of the lower court ruling delivered on 16thJune 2021 is hereby set aside and substituted with an order that upon survey , the suit property will be divided equally between the Estate of the deceased and Manoah Ngaira.c).Pursuant to order (i) of the said Ruling the surveyor to file the survey report within 30 days from the date of this ruling to facilitate distribution of the property. The distribution of the suit property will proceed before this court after the filing of the survey report.d).This matter will be mentioned on a date to be given at the date of delivery of this Ruling for confirming compliance with order (b) aboveDATED , SIGNED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI, VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS THIS 26THDAY OF AUGUST 2024.S.

The Petitioner attended to the meeting as required of him.vii.Before and during the Inquiry, the Petitioner raised his concerns on the Conduct of the matter by the Is1Respondent Board, however, his concerns were dismissed and he was instead warned by the Inquiry Officers that he did not have any right to make demands but to respond to the questions being asked.viii.During the meeting Mr. Eric Bii who was the Supervisor at Isiolo County testified that there was no evidence of involvement in any of the stated allegations against the Petitioner, however, the 1stRespondent Board denied the Petitioner a chance to cross-examine Eric Bii and refused to show the Petitioner the contents of the confidential letters submitted by Eric Bii they were relying on.ix.The 2ndwitness Ahmed Mohammed testified that there were no complaints against the Petitioner or the Petitioner of their involvement in any malpractice during the vetting process.x.The Board Chairman attempted to coerce the Petitioner to change his initial plea of not guilty to guilty and to write a mitigation plea for leniency seeking forgiveness since they had some incriminating evidence that would lead to his dismissal but the Petitioner rejected the approach.xi.On or about the 24thof July, 2022, the Turkana Intelligence Coordinator (CIC) notified the Petitioner that the Board, Inquiry had found him guilty of all charges and he should await the final decision. However, asked him to urgently submit a mitigation plea to allow leniency final ruling.xii.On or about the 23rdof August, 2022, the Petitioner was unlawfully and unfairly dismissed from the National Intelligence Service with effect from 1stSeptember, 2022 without any lawful cause and/or justification whatsoever.xiii.The Petitioner further averred that the 1stRespondent; -a.Appointed one Robert Gichura to be the Investigating Officer in to the matter and the Petitioner requested for his disqualification from the Board due to conflict of interest but his request was quashed and Robert was appointed Secretary of the Board.b.Some of the 1stRespondent Board members used demeaning language and intimidated the Petitioner during the Inquiry proceedings and when the Petitioner requested for audio recording of the proceedings his request was ignored.c.Ignored and or denied the Petitioner’s request to be provided with evidence, witnesses and complaint to the allegations in order for cross-examination: and instead pressured the Petitioner to plead guilty and ask for forgiveness in case he wanted to retain his job.d.Denied the Petitioner access to the records of all individuals that were vetted for passports from Isiolo during his tenure to help disqualify the allegations made against him which violated the provisions of Article 47 and Article 50 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya 2010 and Section 4 of theFair Administrative Action Act.2.The Respondent filed a replying affidavit through one Vincent Cheruyiot the Respondent’s Senior Human Resource on 26thApril, 2023 in which it stated among others:a.That from the records held in the NIS Human Resource Department, the Petitioner was appointed to the NIS effective 17thJanuary 2017 vide letter dated 17thJanuary 2017and on 20thJanuary 2017, the Petitioner accepted the terms and conditions contained in the appointment letter dated 17thJanuary 2017.b.That part of the conditions for employment of the Petitioner was to be subject to all rules and regulations for NIS officers as laid down in the NISAct No. 28 of 2012and as amended from time to time.That Section 16 of theNational Intelligence Service Actwhich governs all NIS officers including the Petitioner before dismissal and Section 23 of theNational Intelligence Service Actprovide for the issuance of a Disciplinary Code and penalties provided under the disciplinary code in case of a breach.c.That the terms and conditions of service of NIS staff, to which the Petitioner was subject to, provide for dismissal of an officer found to have been in a breach of security and other acts of gross misconduct. That the Petitioner having been assigned the sensitive and critical role of vetting applicants for passport issuance, was engaged in offensive acts of Soliciting and receiving bribes from officers and members of the public thus causing a breach of security, bringing the NIS into serious disrepute and this amounted to gross misconduct.d.That the Petitioner was issued with a notice to show cause on 25thApril 2022 detailing the acts of gross misconduct he had committed and he was given 14 days to file a response and show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.e.That in view of the grave nature of offence he had committed and in accordance with the 1stRespondent’s Disciplinary Rules and Regulations (“DRR”), the Petitioner was interdicted from exercising his duties pending finalization of the case.

The dismissal therefore caught the Petitioner by surprise. Counsel further submitted that upon interdiction the Petitioner only received half his salary and house allowance which he used to settle his Sacco loan and deposited only Kshs. 600/- in his Bank Account. This according to counsel was intentional punishment and violated the provisions of Article 4(1) and 28 ofthe Constitution. Counsel further submitted that the 1stRespondent’s Board made six allegations against the Petitioner however the Board tried him for only one count which was soliciting and receiving bribes from other officers or members of the public contrary to DRR 2.1. In addition, the Board deviated from the allegations made against the Petitioner in the Notice to Show Cause letter dated 25thApril, 2022. The Board questioned the Petitioner about his other sources of living and demanded records of his company’s transactions which were not relevant to the case made against him by the Board.4.Concerning discrimination, counsel submitted that the Respondent consistently posted the Petitioner to risky and hardship arears such as Wajir, Isiolo and Turkana areas which were miles away from the Petitioner’s home area of Kuria East Migori County. When the Petitioner sought clarification from his supervisor he was advised to report first to his new station to allow the supervisor handle the matter on his behalf but this was never done. This according to the Petitioner violated the provisions of Article 27(4) and 41(1) ofthe Constitution.5.Concerning the disciplinary hearing, Mr. Museve submitted that the Petitioner objected to one Mr. Robert Gichura as investigating officer as he was conflicted but the request was not heeded and Gichura was appointed Secretary to the Board. Further the Respondent ignored the Petitioner’s request to be provided with evidence, witnesses and complaints and allegations against him but instead was pressured to plead guilty and ask for forgiveness in case he wanted to retain his job. Counsel further submitted that during the 1stRespondent’s Board Inquiry proceedings, the members of the Board obtained and held print-outs of the Petitioner’s cellphone communications, messages and bank statements that were used to ask him questions without sharing the same with him. That according to counsel this amounted to infringement of the Petitioner’s privacy contrary to provisions of Article 31(1)(c) & (d) ofthe Constitution.6.The Petitioner contended that the termination was substantively unfair because it breached the requirements of fair labour practices and impartial hearing as laid down under article 27 ofthe Constitution. The Respondent breached the requirements of human dignity as laid down under article 28 ofthe Constitution, further the Respondent breached the Petitioner’s right to privacy as provided for under Article 31 ofthe Constitution. The termination was substantively unfair because the 1strespondent failed to discharge the statutory burden as it invited two witnesses to give evidence at the Board of Inquiry at which one Eric Bii testified that there was no evidence of the Petitioner’s involvement in any of the stated allegations made against him. This was further stated by the Respondent’s 2ndwitness Mr. Ahmed Mohammed. This therefore showed that the allegations against the Petitioner were malicious.7.Mr. Museve further submitted that the termination was procedurally unfair and was contrary to section 45(2), (a), (b) (c) of theEmployment Actand section 4 of theFair Administrative Action Actbecause the 1stRespondent denied the Petitioner a chance to cross-examine Mr. Eric Bii and refused to show him the contents of the confidential report submitted by him.8.Counsel requested this court to consider the Authorities in Cause No 147 of 2018, Monica Jepkorir Kipketer v Teachers Service Commission, Cause No. 253 of 2017; Erick Wafula Wetungu v Eastern Produce (K) Ltd(Savani Estate Kamkong) and Petition No 49 of 2020, Chianda v Judicial SERVICE Commission & Another.Respondent’s Submissions9.Mr. Mulili for the Respondent on the other hand submitted while relying on the averments in their replying affidavit filed in this court. On the appropriateness of the Petition, Counsel submitted that the same was premature as the petitioner failed to exhaust internal remedies. The DRR gave the Petitioner an opportunity for further appeal if dissatisfied with the verdict of DDC, to the Service Disciplinary Committee and further to the Director General but the Petitioner did not find it necessary to exhaust the internal appeal process. He instead rushed to court through this petition.10.That failing to exhaust the appeal mechanism makes the petition premature hence should be struck out. In this respect, Counsel relied on section 9(2) of theFair Administrative Action Actwhich provides that the High Court or subordinate Court shall not review an administrative action or decision under the Act unless the mechanism including internal mechanism for appeal or review and all remedies available under any other written law are first exhausted. Counsel further relied on the case of Robert Khamala Situma & 8 Others v Acting Clerk of the Nairobi City Assembly [2022] eKLR.11.On the issue whether the termination was unlawful, Counsel submitted that the termination was lawful and fair. In this respect Counsel relied on the provisions of sections 41, 43 and 45(2) of theEmployment Act. According to Counsel, section 41 was fully complied with. The Petitioner was served with a show cause letter for gross misconduct dated 25thApril, 2022 containing clear details of the offences that he was charged with. He was subsequently charged with the offences of engaging in offensive acts of soliciting and receiving bribes from officers and members of the public, breach of security, bringing the service into the disrepute and engaging in gross misconduct. The charges were brought under NIS Disciplinary Rules and Regulations. The Board followed due procedure and found the Petitioner guilty of the charges against him. In this respect Counsel relied on the case of British Leyland UK Ltd vs. Swift [1981]. I.R.L.R 91 per Lord Denning.12.On the question whether the Petitioner has demonstrated a violation of his rights underthe Constitution, Mr. Mulili submitted that the issues raised in the petition were ordinary employment and labour relations dispute disguised as a constitutional issue contrary to the provisions of article 162(2) and 165(5) ofthe Constitutionas read together with section 12 of theEmployment and Labour Relations Court Act. The petition ought to have been presented as an ordinary claim. Counsel further submitted that theNational Intelligence Service Actunder part IV thereof provide for limitation of rights and freedoms of persons who are subject to investigations by the service or suspected to have committed an offence to the extent that subject to section 42, the privacy of a person’s communication may be investigated, monitored or otherwise interfered with. The Service shall prior to taking any action under the section obtain a warrant. In the light of the foregoing provision, counsel submitted that the Petitioner’s contention that his right to privacy was violated cannot stand.13.Further on the issue of violation of Constitutional rights, counsel submitted that it was trite law that when someone alleges breach of constitutional right, such person must prove such assertion. It was not sufficient to simply state that a certain Article ofthe constitutionhas been breached without stating with proof, exactly how it was breached as the Petitioner has done in this case. In this regard, counsel relied on the case of Stephen Nyarangi Onsoma & Another vs. George Magoha & 7 others [2014] eKLR and Mumo Matemu vs. Trusted Society for Human Rights Alliance & 5 others [2013] eKLR among others.14.The Respondent raised a fundamental question of vital importance in deciding this petition. This Court on 27thOctober,2023 stayed the delivery of the judgment in this case and ordered the Petitioner to exhaust the Respondent’s internal dispute resolution mechanics by appealing within 30 days. The matter was to be mentioned on 11thDecember,2023 for further directions. On 8thApril,2024 it was confirmed before the court that the Petitioner’s appeal to PSC was unsuccessful and it was not clear before the court if the Petitioner had exhausted the right to second appeal. The matter was again mentioned on 27thMay,2024 where it was given this judgment date to mean that the internal processes failed.Determination.15.This court has reviewed and considered the Petition, the Respondent’s replying affidavit and submissions by both counsels in support and opposition to the Petition; the authorities relied on by counsels and the court has come up with three main issues;a.I have Aa. aa. Whether the Petitioner was unfairly terminatedb.Whether the Petitioner’s Constitutional rights were violated by the 1stRespondent and if the Petitioner was discriminatedc.Whether the Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs sought.Whether the Petitioner was unfairly terminated16.It is now clear that for termination to pass fairness test there must be both substantive and procedural fairness. I refer to the cases of Janet Nyandiko versus Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (2017) eKLR and Walter Ogal Anuro v Teachers Service Commission [2013] eKLR. In the instance case the Respondent has put forth reasons for the summary dismissal of the Petitioner in its dismissal letter dated 23rdAugust ,2022 on six offences set out in its show cause letter dated 25thApril,2022. The main offence against the Petitioner was soliciting and receiving bribes from other officers or members of the public contrary to DRR 2.1(xxiv) among others related to this offence. According to the Respondents these offences were grievous in nature and the evidence provided by the investigating board was convincing beyond reasonable doubt.17.Whereas the Respondent raised those grounds it needed to substantiate the same as required under section 43 of theEmployment Actthat the employer must prove the reasons for termination. The said reasons must be fair and valid and the employer must believe they existed. The employer has a burden under section 47(5) to prove and justify the grounds of termination of an employee.18.The court notes that from the bank statements provided before it the 1stRespondent had a valid reason to dismiss the Petitioner who had excess deposits than what he was earning and some deposits have clearly been linked to the customers he assisted clear their passports. The burden of proof in civil matters is on balance of probabilities and not beyond reasonable doubt. To this extent the court finds that the Petitioner was linked to the offences of soliciting and receiving bribes as shown from the investigation reports.19.The court notes that the Petitioner’s conduct of soliciting and receiving bribes amounted to gross misconduct under section 44(4) of theEmployment Actand were grounds for summary dismissal. The same were also against the 1stRespondent’s Disciplinary Rules and Regulations under clause 2.1(xxiv).20.Concerning procedure for termination, the claimant was issued with notice to show cause detailing the allegations against him and he respondent to the same and was subsequently invited for a disciplinary hearing where he was interrogated over the same and at conclusion thereof dismissed.21.The Court notes that under section 42 of the respondent’s Act, part IV thereof provide for limitation of rights and freedoms of persons who are subject to investigations by the service or suspected to have committed an offence to the extent that subject to section 42, the privacy of a person’s communication may be investigated, monitored or otherwise interfered with. The Court further notes that the petitioner was working in highly securitised institution, some sort of quasi-disciplined force hence the rigours of civilian processes could in certain situations be strictly observed. To this extent the Court is satisfied that there was reasonable procedural fairness in the hearing process culminating in the petitioner’s termination of service.Whether the Petitioner’s Constitutional rights were violated by the 1stRespondent and if the Petitioner was discriminated22.The Petitioner has alleged that a number of his Constitutional rights and freedoms were infringed ranging from right to human dignity, privacy, labour relations, equality from discrimination and fair administrative Action. The Petitioner has not stated with precision how the same rights were infringed. An employee of the respondent could be investigated once it was suspected of involvement in any illegal activity. This was provided for in the NIS Act. In the case of Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance & 5 others(2013) eKLR the Court stated that the Petition ought to be pleaded with precision as required in constitutional Petitions and held as follows:-It is our finding that the petition before the High Court was not pleaded with precision as required in constitutional petitions. Having reviewed the petition and supporting affidavit, we have concluded that they did not provide adequate particulars of the claims relating to the alleged violations ofthe Constitutionof Kenya and theEthics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2011. Accordingly, the petition did not meet the standard enunciated in the Anarita Karimi Njeru case (supra)23.This leads to the Conclusion that the Petitioner has not established a prima facie constitutional case against the Respondents. The issue of discrimination therefore fails as the Petitioner has not illustrated how being sent to the far counties discriminated against him. In the case ofGichuru v Package Insurance Brokers Ltd (Petition 36 of 2019) [2021] KESC 12 (KLR) (22 October 2021) Discrimination was explained as follows:“Discrimination was failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction could be found between those favoured and those not favoured. Not all cases of distinction amounted to discrimination. Discrimination could be said to have occurred where a person was treated differently from other persons who were in similar positions on the basis of one of the prohibited grounds like race, sex disability or due to unfair practice and without any objective and reasonable justification.”24.Equally, in Francis Njeru Kariuki v Crown Paints Kenya Limited [2022] eKLR it was held that:“According to the Court of Appeal in Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd & another v Gladys Muthoni & 20 others [2018] eKLR –“…Discrimination means affording different treatment to different persons attributable wholly or mainly to their descriptions … whereby persons of one such description are subjected to … restrictions to which persons of another description are not made subject or are accorded privileges or advantages which are not accorded to persons of another such description…”In the instant case, apart from stating that position of Business Development Manager was given to another person, the Claimant provided no factual basis for the allegation. It is the finding of the Court that the Claimant has not on a balance of probabilities established that he was discriminated.""25.In conclusion, the petition is hereby found without merit and is hereby dismissed with costs.26.It is so orderedDATED AT NAIROBI THIS 6TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 6TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024ABUODHA NELSON JORUMJUDGE",Tuguro v National Intelligence Service & another (Petition E213 of 2022) [2024] KEELRC 2183 (KLR) (6 September 2024) (Judgment),Petition E213 of 2022,"NJ Abuodha, J","September 6, 2024",

      [2024] KETAT 1254 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalTax Appeal E589 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, Jephthah Njagi, E Ng'ang'a & G Ogaga, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenChloride Exide Kenya LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Customs & Border ControlRespondentJudgmentBackground1.The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated in Kenya and carries on the business of installation of solar water heating systems, backup systems and distribution of automotive batteries.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of the Kenya Revenue Authority Act, 1995. Under Section 5 (1) of the said Act, the Kenya Revenue Authority is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue. Respondent conducted a desk audit of the Appellant's imports of solar water heaters for the period 2016 to 2021.3.On 13thJune 2023, the Appellant imported solar water heater systems and declared the goods under the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (""HS"") Code 8419.19.00. The Appellant used import declaration form for the import as entry No 23EMKIM400638671.4.The Respondent declined to clear the solar water heaters under HS Code 8419.19.00 and reclassified the solar water heaters under HS Code 8516.10.00.5.The Appellant vide a letter dated 15thJune 2023 requested the Respondent to clear the goods under HS Code 8419.19.00 in accordance with the Tax Appeals Tribunal's decision dated 12thMay 2023 on a similar matter between the parties in TAT No. 369 of 2021, in which the Tribunal held that the Appellant’s solar water heater systems are classifiable under Heading 8419.6.The Respondent vide a letter dated 21stJune 2023 declined to release the goods under HS Code 8419.19.00 on the basis that the Respondent had filed an appeal at the High Court against the Tribunal's decision in TAT No. 369 of 2021.7.The Appellant vide a letter dated 21stJuly 2023 lodged an application for review of the Commissioner’s decision to reclassify solar water heating systems under HS Code 8516.10.00.8.The Respondent vide a letter dated 4thAugust 2023, declined the Appellant's application for review and upheld its decision to reclassify solar water heating systems under HS Code 8516.10.00.9.Aggrieved by the Respondent's decision to reclassify solar water heating systems under HS Code 8516.10.00, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal dated 15thSeptember 2023.The Appeal10.The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal dated and electronically filed on 29thSeptember 2023 raising the following grounds of appeal:-a.That the Respondent erred in law in failing to appreciate that the Appellant imported solar water heating systems.b.That the Respondent erred in law in failing to appreciate that solar water heater systems are classifiable under Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (""HS"") code 8419.19.00.c.That the Respondent erred in law in failing to appreciate that the Tribunal has already held that the Appellant's solar water heater systems are classifiable under HS Code 8419.19.00.d.That the Respondent erred in law by finding that solar water heater systems are classifiable under HS Code 8516.10.00.e.That the Respondent erred in law by failing to appreciate that HS Code 8516.10.00 only applies to dual system heaters in which the dual system is either electrical or connected to a fuel heated hot water system.The Appellant’s Case11.The Appellant’s case was premised on the following documents and proceedings before the Tribunal:-a.The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated and filed on 29thSeptember 2023 together with the attachments thereto.b.The evidence of Sammy Waite as per the Witness Statement dated and filed on 26thApril 2024 and admitted in evidence under oath by the Tribunal on 16thMay 2024.c.The Appellant’s written submissions dated and filed electronically on 30thMay 2024.d.Appellant’s list of legal authorities dated and filed on 30thMay 2024.12.The Appellant averred that it imports solar water heating systems and not electric or fuel heated systems. That these solar water heating systems constitute of specialized equipment for the development and generation of solar energy from sunlight.13.That Regulation 2 of the Energy (Solar Water Heating) Regulations, 2012 has clearly defined a solar water heating system as:-“a device or system that uses sunlight to heat water and comprises of solar collectors, storage tanks, controls, installation hardware and fittings.”14.That the solar water heating system imported by the Appellant is designed to exclusively use sunlight to heat water.15.That further, the solar water heating system imported by the Appellant consists of solar collectors that absorb solar energy, a storage tank that accumulates thermal energy in the form of solar heated water, controls, solar hardware, and fittings installations which are exclusively designed to support the operation of the solar water heaters.16.That due to the fact that the systems imported by the Appellant are solar water heating systems, for the period prior to June 2020, the Appellant’s solar water heating systems qualified for VAT exemption and were approved as such by the Respondent, Ministry of Energy and the National Treasury on the basis that they are specialized equipment which exclusively use solar power to heat water and/or are specialized equipment for the development and generation of solar energy to heat water.17.That all solar water heaters sold or imported into Kenya are required by law to be fitted with an auxiliary electric heating element as a backup system. That this is pursuant to Regulation 9 of the Solar Water Heating Regulations and the Kenya Bureau of Standards quality standards No. KS 1860.2009 that provides that the components for solar water heating systems must include an auxiliary heat source which supplements or functions as back-up on the rare occasion when there is insufficient sunlight.18.That therefore, for purposes of compliance with the Regulations, the solar water heating systems imported by the Appellant were fitted with an auxiliary backup electric booster.19.That the electric booster’s role is simply to supplement the solar heater, in the rare occasions when there is insufficient sunlight.20.That the solar water heating system imported by the Appellant can only use one energy source at a time, and it is specifically designed to use solar energy to heat water. That the system is therefore not a dual or hybrid system. It is a solar water heating system that has an auxiliary backup electric booster as required by the Solar Water Heating Regulations.21.That the solar water heating system can operate exclusively and independently using solar energy without the presence of the electric booster. That the presence of an electric booster is included for regulatory purposes and it does not take away the essential character of the solar water heating system, which is a devise designed to utilize solar energy to heat water.22.That the electric booster is not automatically or simultaneously used when the solar water system is installed. That the electric booster can only be used when a customer after purchase of the imported solar water heaters, makes the necessary installations to activate the electric booster.23.That customers who do not have access to electricity or who do not incur the additional installation material, never activate the booster and hence exclusively rely on solar energy to heat water.24.That the solar water heating system imported by the Appellant is complete in itself and can solely rely on solar energy without a customer adding installations to activate the electric booster.25.That as stated by the Appellant’s witness,“these solar water heating systems in areas which are off-grid power such as the lodges in Mara, Turkana, Samburu, and other arid areas function solely on solar energy, without ever having to activate the backup electrical component, as there is sufficient solar energy is such arid off-grid areas. This further goes on to demonstrate that these solar water heating systems are solely reliant on solar energy and are therefore not dual water heating systems.”26.That the electric component is a minor component of these solar water heaters and the cost implication of the booster is a minor percentage of the solar water heating system's cost (less than 7%). That therefore, the inclusion of the back-up component mandated by law, does not take away the essential character of solar water heaters, which is to utilize sunlight to heat water.27.The Appellant averred that the Company has been compelled to ensure that the solar water heaters have an auxiliary back up electric heating component as a result of the statutory requirements. That infact, if it was not for the policy directive and the statutory requirements, the Appellant would actually import systems without the auxiliary back up element, but such a system would not be approved or released from the point of import by KEBS officials.28.The Appellant averred that solar water heaters are classified under HS Code 84.19 That the East African Community Common External Tariff (EAC CET) provides the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (""HS"") code that is used to determine the HS Code for goods.29.That in interpreting the EAC CET, one must be guided by the General Interpretation Rules (""GIR"") for the classification of goods.30.That Rule 1 of the GIR provides as follows:“The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the heading and any relative Section or Chapter Notes ... ""31.Therefore, the determination of the classification of a product is duly based on the terms of headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.32.That in accordance with GIR Rule 1, solar water heaters would fall under tariff Heading 84.19 which covers non electric storage water heaters.33.The Appellant averred that since the Appellant’s solar water heating system has been fitted with an auxiliary electric booster, it is deemed to be a composite machine.34.That Note 3 to Section XVI of the EAC CET provides that a composite machine designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions should be classified as if consisting only of the component which performs the principal function.35.That in addition, GIR 3(b) which deals with classification of composite goods states that goods will be classified on the basis of the component that gives them their essential character. GIR 3(b) provides that:“Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.”36.The Appellant averred that Heading 8516 does not apply to the products it imports. That the Respondent has indicated that the goods imported by the Appellant are dual water heating systems which fall under HS code 8516.10.0037.That Heading 8516 covers electric instantaneous or storage water heaters and immersion heaters. Further, a dual system heater provided for under heading 8516 is specifically indicated to be one in which “water is heated either electrically or by connection to a fuel heated hot water system.”38.That the equipment imported by the Appellant is a specialised equipment which uses solar energy derived from sunlight to heat water and does not have a fuel heated system, as such it does not qualify for the dual system heaters envisaged under Heading 8516.39.That in view of the fact that Heading 8516 covers water heating systems that are either electric or fuel heated, and the solar water heating system imported by the Appellant does not fall within this category, Heading 8516 does not apply.40.The Appellant submitted that in a similar matter between the parties, the Respondent reclassified the HS Code for the solar water heater systems which the Appellant had imported for the period January 2016 to December 2020 from HS Code 8419.19.00 to HS Code 8516.10.00.41.That on 12thMay 2023, the Tribunal in Tax Appeal No 369 of 2021 correctly held that the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are classified under Heading 8419 and that the Respondent had erred in reclassifying the goods under HS Code 8516.10.00.42.That therefore, the decision by the Respondent to reclassify solar water heating systems imported under Entry No 23EMKIM400638671 is in contravention of the Tribunal's decision.43.That the Judgment issued by the Tribunal is binding and enforceable against the Respondent. That the Respondent has ignored the Tribunal's decision.44.The Appellant submitted that the Tribunal in that Judgment, Chloride Exide Limited v the Commissioner of Customs and Border Control (TAT No. 369 of 2021) having analysed the solar water heaters and having applied the General Interpretative Rules (GIR) correctly found at paragraph 84, that:-“based on the submissions the essential characteristics of the water heaters in question that distinguish them are the solar collectors commonly fitted to all solar water heaters. They are offered for sale as solar water heaters and must essentially be fitted in a location where they are able to collect solar energy. The immersion heaters which is a characteristic of electric heaters forms only a small percentage of the system. Furthermore, the electric component is fitted largely to ensure compliance with the Regulatory requirements"".45.The Appellant submitted that the Tribunal then correctly concluded that the solar water heaters are properly classifiable under HS Code841919.00.46.The Appellant further submitted that the Tribunal has made the same finding in numerous other decisions including Orb Energy Private Limited v the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes (TAT No. 101 of 2022) and Power Max Solar Solutions v the Commissioner of Customs and Border Control (TAT No. 681 of 2022). The Appellant submitted that the Tribunal herein ought to apply its own decisions and uphold the Appellant’s Appeal.47.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent attached an inconclusive WCO advisory opinion to its Statement of Facts. That the Tribunal has disregarded the opinion in previous decisions as the Respondent failed to demonstrate that the Explanatory Notes have been amended to adopt the opinion.48.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent’s own witness admitted during cross-examination that another draft opinion would still have to presented at the next pre-sessional working party as is clearly stated on the last page of the opinion. That the opinion is therefore not conclusive and of no consequence to the Appeal herein.49.The Appellant submitted that it sufficiently demonstrated to the Tribunal that the Respondent had no basis for classifying the Appellant's solar water heaters under Hs. Code 8516.10.00 as the system does not use fuel to heat water. That the Appellant correctly classified its water heating system under HS Code 8419.19.00. That this Tribunal has in a decision between the same parties as well as other numerous decisions cited herein held that solar water heaters are classifiable under HS Code 8419.19.00. The Appellant prayed that the Tribunal upholds its previous correct and well reasoned decisions to ensure consistency in its decision making process.Appellant’s prayers50.The Appellant prayed that the Tribunal finds that:-a.This Appeal has merit and should be allowed.b.Ther solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are classified under tariff code 8419.19.00.c.The Respondent erred in law in reclassifying the HS Code of the solar water heater systems imported under Entry No 23EMKIM400638671.d.The Respondent's decision dated 4thAugust 2023 lacks basis in law and fact and be annulled and set aside in its entirety.respondent’s case51.The Respondent’s case was premised on the following documents:-a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 31stOctober 2023 and filed on 3rdNovember 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.The witness statement of Mr. Bernard Oyucho dated 19thApril 2024 and filed on 24thApril 2024 that was admitted in evidence under oath on 16thMay 2024.c.The Respondent’s written submissions dated 30thMay 2024 and filed electronically on the same date.d.The Respondent’s list of authorities dated and filed electronically on 30thMay 2024.52.The Respondent averred that it undertook a Post Clearance Audit of the Appellant's operations for the period January 2016 to December 2020 and the Respondent issued its demand on the subject Entry No. 23EMKIM400638671 of Kshs. 536,980.00 being extra taxes (Import Duty and VAT) computed based on the HS Code 8516.10,00 as opposed to the HS code declared by the Appellant being HS Code 8419.90.00.53.That the Respondent assessed the Appellant for duties having classified solar water heaters it imported under HS Code 8419.19.00 instead of the correct classification which is HS Code 8516.10.00.54.That the Appellant objected to the assessment vide its letter dated 21stJuly 2023 and the Respondent confirmed the assessment vide its letter dated 4thAugust 2023.55.The Respondent averred that the item in question is specified to be a dual-system solar water heater that could be operated by both solar power and electricity. The system is designed to heat water and circulate the heated water to showers of faucets in homes.56.That the system consists of a solar-energy collector panel and hot water storage tank. The collector panel receives cool water from the house's water supply by an included pump. The water in the panel is heated by the sun and then stored in the storage until used. That the water heating unit contains a copper coil as an auxiliary electric element. That the electric heating element is connected to the water tank to heat water electrically if solar power/energy is insufficient.57.That the question is whether the solar water heaters with the provisions of electric heating element are classifiable under EAC CET 2017 HS Code 8516.10.00 as suggested or HS Code 8419.19.00 as was declared. That the basis of the decision on the tariff classification is the EAC CET 2022 CET Explanatory Notes and the item as presented at the time of importation.58.The Respondent reiterated that the tariff classification for the item in question the dual water heating system, has been deliberated on by the World Customs Organization's Harmonised System Committee (HSC) and provided as HS Code 8516.10.00. That this review is now officially part of the Harmonised Systems Compendium of Classifications.59.That further to the aforementioned, this decision was affirmed through a Meeting by the World Customs Organization where the HS Code 8516.10.00 was confirmed and Minutes of the Meeting were produced and shared.60.The Respondent also stated that it has moved to the High Court to challenge and have the decision of the TAT on these matters reversed and the stay of previous orders of 30thSeptember 2022 granted to the Appellant was lifted.61.That the matter came up for mention on 4thOctober, 2023 before Justice Lawrence Mugambi, and the Court agreed with the Respondent to set aside the interim orders issued on 30thSeptember, 2022 in lieu of the new developments of the World Customs Organization (WCO) ruling.62.That classification of goods is guided by application of the General Interpretative Rules of the Harmonized System. That GIR 1 provides that the titles of Sections, Chapters and Sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings and any relative Section or Chapter, Notes and, provided such Headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the specified provisions.63.That from the Explanatory Notes to GIR 1, it is evident that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings. Explanatory Note 1 states that: the expression “Provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require"" is intended to make it quite clear that the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes are paramount, they are the first consideration in determining classification.64.That Heading 84.19 provides for classification of instantaneous or storage water heaters, non-electric. In other words, in order to be classified in Heading 84.19, such water heaters must heat water non-electrically.65.That as provided for in the WCO classification guidance, a dual-system water heater that can heat water by an electric element does not meet the terms of heading 84.19 and thus cannot be classified in this heading.66.That Explanatory Note to Heading 84.19 state"".... The machinery and equipment classified under this heading may or may not incorporate mechanical equipment. They may be heated by any system (Coal, oil, gas, steam, electricity, etc.) except in case of instantaneous water heaters & storage water heaters which are classified in heading 8516 when electrically heated.""67.That Heading 85.16 provides for the classification of electric instantaneous or storage water heaters and immersion heaters. The terms of Heading herein confirms that the water solar water heaters satisfy the terms of Heading 85.16.68.That as guided by the general Interpretative Rule 1 of the Harmonized System, a complete dual-system solar water heater with a provision of an electric heating element; whether presented with the electric heating element or not at the time of importation, is considered classifiable in EAC/CET 2017 HS Code 8516.10.00.69.The Respondent submitted that the following should be the issues for determination in this matter.a.Whether the Tribunal is bound by WCO rulings?b.Whether the Respondent erred in classifying the Solar Heating Systems under tariff code 8516.10.00 instead of tariff code 8419.19.00.70.The Respondent submitted that World Customs Organization (WCO), established in 1952 as the Customs Co- operation Council (CCC) is an independent inter-governmental body whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Customs administrations.71.That WCO plays an important role in promoting international customs co-operation and addressing new challenges for customs and trade.72.That the Harmonized System (HS) is administrated by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and is updated every five years. It serves as the foundation for the import and export classification systems used in the United States and by many trading partners. That the HS assigns specific six-digit codes for varying classifications and commodities.73.The Respondent submitted that it is alive to the fact that the Tribunal has rendered various Judgments touching on the classification of a product called “dual system solar water heater” wherein it was held that HS Code 8419.19.00 is applicable instead of HS Code 8516.10.00 proposed by the Commissioner.74.The Respondent submitted that the issue of classification was taken to the WCO which is the body tasked with guiding customs organizations on matters classification and matters customs and trade and the Harmonised System Committee of the WCO has since deliberated on the appropriate classification of the dual system water heater and concurred with the Respondent’s classification under HS Code 8516.10.00.75.That the decision of the WCO was drawn from the WCO’s website as evidence in the footnotes of the document with the ruling/decision, confirming it is indeed a legitimate document and further the same was annexed to the Respondent’s Statement of Facts and the same is on record before the Tribunal and was also shared with the Appellant.76.That the Respondent is bound to apply the decisions of the Harmonised System Committee of the WCO by virtue of Article 2(6) of the Constitution of Kenya since it forms part of the Laws of Kenya.77.The Respondent submitted that the Tribunal in light of the new developments and the uniqueness of this matter that is different from the previous ones the Tribunal has ruled on, the Tribunal ought to invite itself to consider keenly this case on its own merits and treat it differently to avoid a miscarriage of the law.78.That from the perusal of the decision, it is evident that the same is directly relevant to the issue at hand as it offers critical guidance on the classification of dual solar water heaters. Particularly, page XVI/67 provides as follows:-“Dual system water heater for domestic use, which can be operated by solar power or electricity or both. The product has a solar panel with a collector, a pump and a hot water storage tank. When presented, the product contains all the electrical components except a copper coil needed for auxiliary electric heating element to function.”79.On whether the Respondent erred in classifying the solar heating systems under tariff code 8516.10.00 instead of tariff code 8419.19.00 the Respondent submitted that the item in question is specified to be a dual-system solar water heater that could be operated by both solar power and electricity. That the system is designed to heat water and circulate the heated water to showers of faucets in homes.80.The Respondent submitted that even though the water heaters are imported without the electric components as claimed by the Appellant, this does not change their essential character of being dual. The Respondent relied on Rule 2(a) of the GIR which provides as follows:-“Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this Rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.”81.The Respondent further submitted that the question was whether the solar water heaters with the provisions of electric heating element are classifiable under EAC CET 2017 HS Code 8516.10.00 as suggested or HS Code 8419.19.00 as was declared. The basis of the decision on the tariff classification is the EAC CET 2022 CET Explanatory notes and the item as presented at the time of importation.82.The Respondent relied on the case of; Beta Healthcare International Ltd vs. Commissioner of Customs Services [2010] eKLR where the court opined thus:-“Kenya is a signatory to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Kenya became a contracting party to the convention on 29thJanuary 1988. The entry into force of the convention came into effect in Kenya on 1stJanuary 1989.”83.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant’s imported solar water heating systems are classifiable under Chapter 85 of the East African Community Common External Tariff (EAC CET) which is derived from the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System to which Kenya is a signatory.Respondent’s prayers84.The Respondent prayed that:-a.The Tribunal upholds the Respondent's decision to charge tax amounting to Kshs 536.980.00 being extra taxes computed, as due and payable.b.The Tribunal finds that the Respondent correctly classified the Appellant’s item under HS Code 8516.10.00.c.The Tribunal dismisses the Appeal with costs.Issues For Determination85.The Tribunal having carefully reviewed the filings made by the parties, the supporting documentation, the witness statements and the submissions made, is the of the respectful view that the following are the issues that call for its determination in this Appeal:-a.Whether the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are dual-system solar water heaters.b.Whether the Respondent erred in law and in fact in reclassifying the water heaters imported by the Appellant from tariff code 8419.19.00 to tariff code 85.16.10.00.Analysis And Findings86.Having identified the issues falling for its determination, the Tribunal wishes to analyze them as hereunder.a)Whether the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are dual-system solar water heaters.87.The Appellant submitted that its dispute with the Respondent is as to whether the water heaters it imported are solar water heaters or dual-system solar water heaters.88.The Appellant submitted that a solar water heater is generally known, understood, and agreed to mean a device that captures, traps and utilizes the sun's thermal energy to heat water. That what is utilized is the sun's thermal energy/radiation.89.The Appellant further submitted that its solar water heaters are comprised of the tank, and solar collectors among other crucial components all of which are crucial and fundamental to the functionality of the solar water heaters, and without which the system would be inoperable.90.The Appellant submitted that an ordinary definition of the word dual is to consist of two parts or elements. That the use of dual in this instance is very deliberate on the part of the drafters. That is to say, for the system to qualify as dual, it must have not only one or two of the elements, but instead have both in order to be deemed a dual system heater.91.The Explanatory Notes define and prescribe what two elements must be there for the system to be defined as a dual system heater. That the Explanatory Notes are very categorical. That the Notes provide that a dual system heater is one in which water is heated either by electricity ""or"" by a connection to a fuel-heated system. The use of the word ""or"" while further highlighting the dual nature of the system, limits the components applicable to only electricity or fuel. That accordingly, the use of the word ""or"" implies and dictates that for it to be deemed a dual system heater, the system must have the capacity to use both electricity and fuel as a means of heating the water.92.The Appellant submitted that the Explanatory Notes provide a very exhaustive list of the elements to be included in a dual system heater set up, that is electricity and fuel. That there is no contemplation on the part of the drafters for any other components to be included in the set.93.That the Appellant’s solar water heaters are heated by the sun's thermal energy. That conversely, a fuel water heater is understood to be a material like coal, gas or oil that is burned to produce heat or power. That this is not the case with the Appellant’s solar water heaters, which rely primarily on solar energy.94.The Appellant submitted that as prescribed by the Explanatory Note to Heading 85.16, a system is only deemed a dual system heater if it uses both electricity and the combustion of fuel to heat water. That the Appellant's solar water heaters do not have the capability, components or elements to undertake the combustion of fuel.95.The Appellant submitted that the element of duality in the dual system heaters is present to allow for the inter switching between using of electricity or fuel-based combustion. That both systems must be present for it to be deemed dual, as otherwise the system would be solely an electric heater, or a fuel-based heater.96.The Respondent on the other hand submitted that the Appellant’s products have an electric component and are therefore considered dual water heating systems. That a dual-system water heater operates under both solar power and electricity.97.The Respondent also submitted that the system can operate on solar energy or electricity. That without the electrical element, the system would not be effective in heating water when the solar energy is inadequate. That the system would work perfectly without the solar component.98.The Respondent further submitted that from the reference of Heading 84.19 and 85.16 read together with the relevant Explanatory Notes under subheadings, it is clear that the solar water heaters are classifiable under EAC/CET 2017 Hs code 8419.19.00 whilst the electric water heaters are classifiable under EAC/CET 2017 Hs Code 8516.10.00.99.That the solar water heaters equipped with electric water heating back up component are classifiable under Hs Code 8516.10.00 and not Hs Code 8419.19.00.100.The Tribunal has looked at the Explanatory Note A to Heading 85.16 and found that it provides as follows:“(A) Electric Instantaneous Or Storage Water Heaters An Immersion HeatersThis group includes:1.Geysers in which the water is heated as it flows through.2.Storage water heaters (whether or not of the pressure type), i.e., heat-insulated tanks with immersion heating elements. In these heaters water is heated gradually.3.Dual-System Heaters, in which the water is heated either electrically or by connection to a fuel-heated hot water system: they are often equipped with a thermostatic control to operate them electrically only when the alternative means is insufficient.”101.The Tribunal agrees with the Appellant that a system is only deemed a dual system heater if it uses both electricity and the combustion of fuel to heat water. In the pleadings, the Appellant expressly stated that the solar water heaters it imported do not have the capability, components or elements to undertake the combustion of fuel. The Appellant also stated that the solar water heaters it imported did not have “a thermostatic control to operate them electrically” and therefore do not fall within the definition of a dual system given in the Explanatory Notes. This fact was neither challenged nor denied by the Respondent.102.The Tribunal also notes that the element of duality in the dual system heaters is present to allow for the switching between using of electricity or fuel-based combustion. Both systems must be present for it to be deemed dual.103.Since the Appellant’s solar water heaters do not have a “connection to a fuel- heated hot water system” or “thermostatic control” for the system as prescribed by the Explanatory Note A to Heading 85.16, the Tribunal finds that the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are not dual-system solar water heaters.104.Based on the Tribunal’s finding in this and other matters that the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are not dual system heaters, it follows that the purported WCO Ruling on dual-system solar water heaters is not applicable to this matter as the product the Ruling addressed is different from the one imported by the Appellant and the subject of this Appeal.b). Whether the Respondent erred in law and in fact in reclassifying the water heaters imported by the Appellant from tariff code 8419.19.00 to tariff code 8516.10.00.105.The Appellant submitted that HS Code 8516.10.00 is not applicable to solar water heaters as the same covers instantaneous electric water heaters.106.The Appellant also submitted that Heading 85.16 does not in any way address solar water heaters incorporating a back up heating element. That by purporting to classify solar water heaters with an electric back up element under this Heading, the Respondent is purporting to enlarge the scope of HS Code 8516.10.00 which offends the requirements of Rule 3(b) of the GIR which offers clarity where a Heading does not provide clarity regarding the classification of a product.107.The Appellant further submitted that the fact that the solar water heaters cannot be classified under Heading 85.16 is further buttressed by the last paragraph of Explanatory Note A (5) of Chapter 85.16. which provides as follows:-“Assemblies consisting of immersion heaters permanently incorporated in a tank, vat or other vessel are classified in heading 84.19 unless they are designed for water heating only or for domestic use, in which case they remain in this heading.”108.On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that the item in question is a solar water heater used to heat domestic water. That its main energy source is solar energy. However, electricity is secondary and supplies power when the solar function has failed.109.The Respondent submitted that the product specification of the dual system for domestic use is one that has a provision for use of both solar water heater and electric water heater on one product as the one in the dispute before the Tribunal.110.The Respondent submitted that Rule 1 of GIR (General Interpretation Rules), provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the Heading and any relative Section or Chapter Notes, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require the provisions of Rules 2 to 6.111.The Tribunal has looked at the arguments advanced by both parties. The Appellant’s position is that nothing has changed to warrant the re-classification of the product. The character of the product has not changed and all that happened was that the Respondent changed the interpretation of the applicable Code.112.The General Interpretation Rules (GIR 1) under the EAC Common External Tariff 2017 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes. This Rule provides as follows:“The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.”113.The Tribunal notes that since the Heading is clear on the treatment of the solar water heaters, there is no need to consider the Chapter Notes or what other Sections provide. This is because the Heading takes priority and reference to Chapter Notes or other Sections should only be made when the Heading lacks clarity on the classification of the item in question.114.The Tribunal agrees with the Appellant that the electric heating element is not a significant part of the system as the bulk of the water heating system is made of the collectors and heat exchange tank. The Appellant submitted that the backup heater plays a very incidental role in the functioning of the system as the solar system still functions without the electric heating element.115.According to Rule 1, what one sees when they look at the product in dispute is a solar water heater (which the parties agree should be classified under tariff code 8419), as opposed to a water heater, boiler, geyser or hot water tank (which the parties also agree should be classified under Tariff Code 8516). The electric heating element is an accessory to the solar water heater.116.The HS tariff classification codes are internationally used to facilitate global trade. The WCO in the 2022 nomenclature, introduced Tariff Code 8419.12.00 to specifically provide for solar water heaters. The EACCET structure that came into force on 1stJuly 2022 also classified solar water heaters under HS Code 8419.12.00. This is an indication that the WCO and its member states intend that solar water heaters be classified under Chapter 84 thereby reinforcing the Explanatory Notes under Chapter 8516 (5) that solar water heaters should be classified under Chapter 8419.117.The Explanatory Note to Heading 84.19, EAC/ CET further states, in the relevant part as thus:-“The apparatus described above is essentially used industrially, but the heading also covers nonelectric instantaneous water heaters and storage water heaters, including solar water heaters. domestic or not, if electrically heated, such appliances are excluded (heading 85.16).”118.The Explanatory Note to Heading 85.16 similarly provides in the relevant part as follows:-“Assemblies consisting of immersion heaters permanently incorporated in a tank, vat or other vessel are classified in heading 84.19 unless they are designed for water heating only or for domestic use, in which case they remain in this heading. Solar water heaters are also classified in heading 84.19.”119.Going by the provisions in the Harmonized System (HS) Nomenclature and the Explanatory Notes to the same, the Tribunal finds that the correct classification of the solar water heaters imported by the Appellant is Heading 84.19. Indeed, as captured above, even the Explanatory Note to Heading 85.16 which is preferred by the Respondent, directs that solar water heaters should be classified under Heading 84.19.120.The Tribunal in a similar matter by the same parties and on the same product in TAT No. 369 of 2021 Chloride Exide Limited v the Commissioner of Customs and Border Control, having analysed the solar water heaters and having applied the General Interpretative Rules (GIR) correctly found at paragraphs 84 to 86 that:-“84based on the submissions the essential characteristics of the water heaters in question that distinguish them are the solar collectors commonly fitted to all solar water heaters. They are offered for sale as solar water heaters and must essentially be fitted in a location where they are able to collect solar energy. The immersion heaters which is a characteristic of electric heaters forms only a small percentage of the system. Furthermore, the electric component is fitted largely to ensure compliance with the Regulatory requirements"".85.Based on the materials and submissions presented before the Tribunal, the heating system has the appearance and character of a solar heating system. It is the considered view of the Tribunal that the systems are not electric water heating systems fitted with solar components but rather solar water heating systems fitted with electric accessories to enable them to function as electric heaters.86.Consequently, by dint of GIR 3(b), the subject solar water heaters as imported are most appropriately classifiable under HS 8419.”121.The Tribunal has made a similar finding and holding that the correct HS classification for solar water heaters is 8419.19.00 in the following among other matters:-a.Appeal No. 179 of 2022, Sunpower International Limited V Commissioner of Customs & Border Control.b.Appeal No. 101 of 2022, ORB Power V Commissioner of Customs & Border Control.c.Appeal No. 249 of 2021, Scandinavian Solar Systems Limited V Commissioner of Customs & Border Control.d.Appeal No. 368 of 2021, Davis and Shirtliff Limited V Commissioner of Customs & Border Control.e.Appeal No. 922 of 2022, Namah Enterprises Limited V Commissioner of Customs & Border Control.122.In the decisions on classification of solar water heaters indicated above, the Tribunal correctly held that the solar water heaters are properly classifiable under HS Code 8419.19.00 and no evidence has been placed before the Tribunal to persuade it to depart from this finding.123.During the hearing the Tribunal asked the Respondent to distinguish the instant matter from the ones that the Tribunal had decided upon. The Respondent indicated that in its submissions, it would attach the decision of the High Court on the issue of classification of solar water heaters from Heading 8419 to Heading 8516. Although in its list of authorities it indicated that the document was attached, the Tribunal did not sight any authorities relating to the purported High Court ruling. In the circumstances the Tribunal is bound by the decisions it has made in the past as there is no reason to make it depart from its earlier findings in the many solar matters that have been concluded.124.In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent erred in law and in fact in reclassifying the water heaters imported by the Appellant from Tariff Code 8419.19.00 to Tariff Code 8516.10.00.Final Decision125.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:-a.The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.b.The solar water heaters imported by the Appellant are classified under Tariff Code 8419.19.00.c.The Respondent’s decision dated 4thAugust 2023 be and is hereby set aside.d.Each party to bear its own costs.126.It is so ordered.DATED and DELIVERED at NAIROBI this 9thday of August, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA-  CHAIRMANJEPHTHAH NJAGI -  MEMBEREUNICE N.

incorporated in Mauritius and acts as a holding company for its subsidiaries and affiliates in Africa and India.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed pursuant to Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act(KRA),Act No. 2 of 1995, and KRA is empowered to enforce and administer provisions of written laws set out in Section 5 as read together with the First Schedule of the KRA Act.3.The dispute herein arose in the course of an audit conducted on RentWorks East Africa Limited, an affiliate of the Appellant.4.On 15thNovember 2022, the Respondent issued Corporation tax assessments for the period 2017 to 2021, bringing to charge the gains from business resulting in a tax liability of Kshs.698,551,593 inclusive of penalties and interests.5.The Appellant, objected to the Respondent's tax demand and assessment notices in a letter dated 15thDecember 2022.6.The Respondent issued its objection decision on 12thFebruary 2023 upholding the assessment on principal tax amounting to Kshs. 488,683,983.007.The Appellant, dissatisfied with the Respondent’s objection decision, lodged a Notice of Appeal at the Tribunal on 12thFebruary 2023.The Appeal8.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal dated 23rdmarch 2023 and filed on 24thMarch 2023:a.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in holding that the Appellant is a resident in Kenya and charging Corporation tax on the Appellant's revenue.b.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in its finding that the management and control of the affairs of the Appellant was exercised in Kenya in any particular year of income under consideration.c.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to find that the Appellant's management and control were exercised in New Zealand, where its sole shareholder and director, Mr GoodalI, resides and makes strategic decisions regarding the Appellant's primary business as a holding company of various worldwide investments.d.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in finding that the management and control of the Appellant was exercised by Rentworks EA's director, Mr Taljaard, in Kenya for the years of income 2017 to 2020 while Mr Taljaard was only appointed as a nominee director of the Appellant in April 2021, not making strategic or management decisions of the Appellant.e.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in charging Corporation tax on the Appellant who does not carry on any business in Kenya and the Appellant's income that was not accrued or derived in Kenya contrary to Sections 3, 4 and 4A of theIncome Tax Act.f.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in finding that the Appellant's business was conducted in Kenya through the Appellant's shareholding in its Kenyan affiliate, Rentworks EA Limited, disregarding the fact that the Appellant and Rentworks EA Limited are separate legal entities as against the principal of separate corporate legal personality.g.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in finding that the Appellant was managed and controlled in Kenya through the Appellant's director's, Mr Taljaard's activities in the Appellant's Kenyan affiliate, Rentworks EA limited, disregarding the fact that the Appellant and Rentworks EA Limited are separate legal entities as against the principal of separate corporate legal personality.h.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in finding that the Appellant lacked the manpower to deliver management services to Rentworks EA Limited, disregarding the fact that its director, Mr. Glenn Goodall, has significant qualification and extensive experience to provide the management services to Rentworks EA limited.i.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in concluding that part of the Appellant's income constituted lease rental income without having any basis for that conclusion.j.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in relying on OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and principles to the revenue of the Appellant that is a non-resident company with no transaction with a related non-resident related party to warrant the application of transfer pricing rule, guidelines or principles.k.That the Respondent erred in law and, in fact, in disregarding the evidence provided by showing that the Appellant’s central and effective management control is not exercised in Kenya and that the Appellant’s revenue was not income accrued or derived in Kenya.l.That the Respondent erred and misdirected itself in upholding the appointment of Mr. Johannes Taljaard as the Appellant's tax representative, whereas the Appellant does not have any tax obligation and is not required to register under any tax law in Kenya.m.That the Respondent erred and misdirected itself in upholding the appointment of Mr. Johannes Taljaard as the Appellant's tax representative, whereas the Mr. Taljaard is not in possession or control of any assets of the Appellant that can be recovered to offset tax payable by the Appellant if any.Appellant’s Case9.The Appellant’s case is premised on the hereunder filed documents: -a.Its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 24thMarch 2023.b.Its Written Submissions dated 20thSeptember, 2023 and filed on even date.10.The Appellant averred that in establishing whether an entity is tax resident in Kenya, the first port of call is theIncome Tax Act(""ITA""). It submitted that Section 2 of the ITA outlines the three tests for determining tax residency of a body corporate. That the relevant part provides as follows:“resident"", when applied in relation—(b)to a body of persons, means—i.that the body is a company incorporated under a law of Kenya; orii.that the management and control of the affairs of the body was exercised in Kenya in a particular year of income under consideration; oriii.that the body has been declared by the Cabinet Secretary, by notice in the Gazette, to be resident in Kenya for any year of income;”11.The Appellant averred that for a company to be duly incorporated in Kenya, it has to comply with the provisions of theCompanies Act2015, and be issued with a certificate of incorporation that demonstrates its compliance.12.The Appellant submitted that the first test is inapplicable in the circumstances as GMI is a holding company duly incorporated in Mauritius as an Authorized Company (previously, a category 2 Global Business Company).13.The Appellant posited that if a company is declared as tax resident by the Minister, its residency status can be confirmed by the gazette notice published. That GMI has not been declared as a tax resident by the Minister.14.The Appellant submitted that the second test for determining residency based on the ""management and control of the affairs of the company"" is not straightforward as the term has not been defined in the ITA. That consequently, in the absence of a definition of what amounts to management and control, guidance is sought from other jurisdictions.15.The Appellant averred that in the United Kingdom, the test has been reframed as ""where the central management and control actually abide”. That this test is determined by reference to the unique circumstances and facts peculiar to the case.16.The Appellant relied on the case of Calartta Jute Mills Co Ltd v Nicholson and Cesena Sulphur Co. Ltd v Nicholson (1876) LR 1 Exch D 428, where the court stated that:“the court was of the view that the place of central management and control is the place where decisions concerning strategic policy and direction of the company are taken.”17.The Appellant further relied on the case of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd v Howe [1906] AC 45S. S TC 198. In which Lord Loreburn observed that:“The decision of Chief Baron Kelly and Baron Huddleston, in the Calcutta Jute Mills v Nicholson and the Cesena Sulphur Co. v Nicholson, now thirty years ago. involved the principle that a Company resides, for purposes of Income Tax [now Corporation Tax], where its real business is carried on. Those decisions have been acted upon ever since. I regard that as the true rule; and the real business is carried on where the central management and control actually abides. It remains to be considered whether the present case falls within that rule. This is a pure question of fact, to be determined, not according to the construction of this or that regulation or by law, but upon a scrutiny of the course of business and trading.”18.The Appellant averred that the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd v Howe case was instrumental in cementing the principle that a company is resident where the real business is carried. That the real business is carried out where the central management and control abides and not where trading operations reside. That hence, management and control of the business need not be in the same place where the actual trading activities and operations of the company are conducted.19.The Appellant submitted that the CMC test seeks to identify where fundamental and strategic decisions concerning the company are made as opposed to the place where day to day profit earning activities are undertaken20.The Appellant further relied on the case of Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock (1960] AC 351; where the Court was also of the view that:“…the issue of management and control is purely a question of fact to be determined upon scrutiny of the course of business and trading.”21.The Appellant postulated that the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2017 takes a fairly similar approach to management and control. That it considers the place of effective management (POEM) and provides at Article 4 Paragraph3that in determining whether a person would be deemed to be a resident, the factors to be considered include the place of effective management, the place where the company is incorporated and any other relevant factors. That the commentary in this Paragraph expounds on this point at Paragraph 24.1 as follows:“Para. 24.1 Competent authorities having to apply paragraph 3 would be expected to take into account of various factors, such as where the meetings of the person's board of directors or equivalent body are usually held, where the chief executive officer and other senior executives usually carry out their activities, where the senior day-to-day management of the person is carried on, where the person '5 headquarters are located. which country's laws govern the legal #atus of the person, where its accounting records are kept, whether determining that the legal person if a resident of one of the Contracting States but not of the other would carry the risk of an improper use of the provisions of the Convention, etc. ""22.The Appellant averred that the OECD commentary notes that, all the relevant facts and circumstances must be examined to determine the place of effective management. That the Guidelines explain that the place of effective management will ordinarily be the place where the most senior person or group of persons, i.e., the board of directors, makes its decisions.23.Additionally, the Appellant submitted that the OECD commentary clarifies that an entity might have more than one place of management, but it can have only one place of effective management at any one time. That if the key decisions are made at more than one location, then the company's place of effective management will be the place where those decisions are predominantly made.24.The Appellant averred that the various factual tests have to be applied, including by the Respondent, to identify a company's management and control regardless of whether it applies the CMC or the POEM test. That these are:i. Day to day operations of GMI25.The Appellant averred that GMI is an investment holding company that manages various shareholdings and business interests worldwide. It submitted that it has business portfolios in multiple jurisdictions, such as in Kenya, Zambia, and South Africa.26.The Appellant averred that it owns and controls shareholding interests in its subsidiaries and affiliates and that it is not actively involved in the business operations of any of its affiliated companies.27.The Appellant submitted that each subsidiary/ affiliate, being a distinct corporate entity, operates on its own and that the entities have different operations as broken down by the Appellant in its Statement of Facts. That Mr. Goodall, as the sole shareholder and controlling director of GMI, makes decisions that specifically touch on GMI’s shareholding/investments in each entity.ii.The types of decisions and mode of decision-making28.The Appellant averred that Mr. Goodall, the sole shareholder and director of GMI, is a citizen and tax resident of New Zealand. The Appellant submitted that Mr. Goodall provided a copy of his passport and a letter from his tax advisors in New Zealand, confirming that he is indeed a resident and duly complies with his tax obligations both in his personal capacity and in relation to GMI.29.The Appellant averred that the Respondent issued an assessment covering the period between 2017 and 2020, when Mr. Goodall was, and still is, a resident of New Zealand and both Mr. Jimmy Wong and Mr. Mike Mootien were nominee directors of GMI from DTOS Limited, GMl's registered agent, who were resident in Mauritius.30.The Appellant submitted that Mr. Goodall solely made all decisions regarding GMI in relation to its affiliates and subsidiaries, including the acquisition and disposal of investment holdings, selling and acquisition of assets, approval and rejection of budgets, approval of significant capital expenditure, re-organizing of subsidiaries, approval of major sales and supplier contracts, approval for funding and risk management.31.The Appellant averred that Mr. Johannes Taljaard only became a director of GMI in April 2021 following the change in Mauritian law requiring that an Authorised Company registered under Section 71 A of the Mauritian Financial Services Act that is controlled by a person who is not a citizen of Mauritius and has its place of effective management outside Mauritius and due to the conversion, the existing directors, Mr. Jimmy Wong and Mr. Mike Mootlen resigned, and Mr. Goodall appointed Mr. Taljaard in their place.iii.Shareholder's Influence and nature of business32.The Appellant relied on the case of Laerstate BV vs. HMRC (2009) UKFlT 209 TC; where the court held that:“a company incorporated in the Netherlands was centrally managed and controlled by its sole shareholder and director in UK who made policy. strategic and management decisions. The court further noted that the second directors were only limited to signing documents and dealing with routine and mundane matters such as accounts. Consequently. the company was resident in UK as its directors and sole shareholder exercised control and management while in UK.”33.The Appellant further relied on the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Trevor Smallwood Trust v HMRC [2010] EWCA Civ 778  wherein it made the following observation regarding the place of effective management:“I emphasize the adjective 'effective. In my opinion it is not sufficient that some sort of management was carried on in the Republic of Ireland such as operating a bank account in the name of the trustees. 'Effective' implies realistic, positive management. The place of effective management if where the shots are called to adopt a vivid transatlantic colloquialism. ""iv. The residency of the Company's directors/the place where decisions were made34.The Appellant submitted that during the assessment period (2017-2020), none of GMl's directors was a resident in Kenya: that Mr. Goodall is a citizen and resident of New Zealand while Mr. Jimmy Wong and Mr. Mike Mootien are residents of Mauritius.35.The Appellant averred that GMl's place of central and effective management and control was in New Zealand where Mr. Goodall normally resides and makes strategic policy and decisions concerning GMl's business interests globally.36.The Appellant submitted that none of the board meetings ever took place in Kenya, and that Mr. Johannes Taljaard, who the Respondent has referred to as the reason why management and control is exercised in Kenya, was not a director during the period under assessment.37.The Appellant averred that GMI is a holding company with investments in various entities globally and in Kenya. That GMI holds a 43.3% shareholding in Rentworks EA. The Appellant submitted that GMI does not engage in any business in Kenya as it is only a shareholder in Rentworks EA and its involvement in the said company is only limited to its passive investment therein.38.The Appellant submitted that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders and directors. The Appellant relied on the case of Securex Agencies Kenya Limited vs Kenya Revenue Authority (2014) eKLR where the court cited with approval the case of Salomon vs Salomon and Company Limited (1897) AC that:“A company is a distinct legal entity independent from its members and directors. ""39.The Appellant averred that the Respondent disregarded the fact that GMl and Rentworks EA Limited are two entities with distinct corporate personalities, and instead, it lumped the two entities together and resorted to making generalized statements that GMl as a whole, derived its income from the business activities of Rentworks EA.40.The Appellant averred that Mr. Johannes and Mr. Glenn met with the Respondent on 23rdMay 2022 in the course of an audit of Rentworks EA where they explained to the Respondent the relationship between GMI and Rentworks EA. The Appellant submitted that the directors clarified that GMI was only a shareholder of Rentworks EA and that GMl being a separate entity its management and control was being exercised from New Zealand.41.The Appellant relied on the case of Unlgate Guernsey Ltd and Unigate Overseas Ltd v McGregor (HMIT) (1995) Sp C 55; where the Court found that:“the subsidiaries were resident in Bermuda and Sark respectively and not in the UK as HMRC had tried to argue. The two subsidiaries were independent and were not merely rubberstamping instructions received from UK-based parent company.”42.The Appellant submitted that the assessment of Corporation tax is purportedly based on the provisions of Section 3(1) and 3(2) (a) (i) of theIncome Tax Act(ITA) and the assumption that GMI received income from lease rentals.43.The Appellant submitted that Kenya operates a source-based tax system. That as such, for any income to be taxable in Kenya, it must be accrued in or derived from Kenya as provided for by Section 3(1) of the ITA, which is the charging Section for income taxes which states as follows:“Subject to, and in accordance with, this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person. whether resident or non-resident which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.""44.The Appellant, therefore, submitted that for a person to be subjected to tax under the ITA, the person's income must be attributable to a Kenyan source, i.e., accrued in or derived from Kenya. The Appellant relied on the case of Motaku Shipping Agencies limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax [2014) eKLR where Justice Kasango reiterated the position that:“From Section 3(1) of the Income Tax Ad, It is clear that subject to the provisions of the Act, the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, is chargeable to income tax provided that the Income accrued in or was derived from Kenya.Therefore, income of a person cannot be subject to income tax unless it is income which was accrued in or was derived from Kenya”."".... It is clear that the income should be ascertained to have accrued or derived from Kenya before any income tax can be levied. By bring to tax funds which are not accrued or derived from Kenya, the Commissioner's action is misconstrued and contrary to the KenyanIncome Tax Act. ""45.The Appellant averred that it clearly explained that its income during the period under assessment was obtained from its investments globally and that the only income derived from Kenya, that is from Rentworks EA, are dividend income and management fees, for which tax was duly withheld and remitted at non-resident rates by Rentworks EA. Further, the Appellant submitted that the income was only a small fraction of its total revenue between 2017 and 2020.46.The Appellant averred that in issuing the assessment on its entire revenue, the Commissioner was purporting to subject income accrued in and derived from several countries outside Kenya to taxation in Kenya, contrary to the clear provisions of theIncome Tax Act.47.The Appellant averred that the Respondent through its assessment dated 15thNovember 2022 appointed GMl's director in Kenya, Mr. Johannes Taljaard as the tax representative of GMI in accordance with Section 15 and 16 of the Tax Procedure Act.48.The Appellant submitted that in appointing Mr. Johannes Taljaard, the Respondent failed to specify the Section upon which it relied in appointing him as a tax representative.49.The Appellant submitted that whereas the Respondent has the power to appoint any person as a tax representative, in exercising such powers, the Commissioner is required to act lawfully, reasonably and procedurally fairly in accordance with Article 47 ofthe Constitutionand Section 4 of theFair Administrative Action Act.50.The Appellant relied on the case of Keroche Industries Limited vs. Kenya Revenue Authority & 5 Others Nairobi HCMA No. 743 of 2006 (2007 KLR 240 for the preposition that:“it is now an accepted principle in this field of law that statutory powers and duties must be exercised and performed reasonably. ""51.The Appellant submitted that the blanket reference to Section 15 as the basis for appointing the two reeks of bad faith and lacks sufficient grounds for appointment. Further, the Appellant averred that the actions go against a well-established canon of certainty in taxation. That this principle has been affirmed in Obbo & Another vs. Attorney General Petition No 71 of 2014(2015) eKLR, where the principle has been affirmed, it was held that:“blatant inconsistency leaves the Petitioners and taxpayers at large position of uncertainty as to what is applicable to them in respect toIncome Tax Act... Inconsistency is not only unlawful but also contravenes the cardinal rule of legislation, and more so fiscal policies and legislation that legislation must be clear and certain. ""52.The Appellant further relied on the case of R vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes ex-parte Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd (Miscellaneous Application 1223 of 2007) wherein it was held that:“the Respondent is obligated by law to state with clarity its claims and state how the transaction falls within the terms of statute. The Respondent cannot exercise its duty like a trawler in the deep sea expecting to catch all the fish by casting its net wide.""53.The Appellant submitted that the only viable provision that the Respondent could have purported to rely on is Section 15(1) (i) of theTax Procedures Act, which provides as follows:“in the case of a non-resident person, if that person is controlling the non-resident person’s affairs in Ken, including a manager of a business of that non-resident person.""54.The Appellant averred that the Respondent failed to demonstrate both in its assessment and objection decision the role played by Mr. Johannes Taljaard to bring him within the provisions of Section 15(1) of theTax Procedures Act.55.The Appellant submitted that Section 16(5) of theTax Procedures Actprovides that the tax payable by a tax representative shall be recoverable only to the extent of the income or assets of the taxpayer that are in the possession or control of the tax representative and that Mr. Johannes Taljaard does not own, control or possess any income or assets of GMI and as such it would be unable to satisfy such obligations.56.Consequently, the Appellant submitted that the appointment of Mr. Johannes Taljaard is unlawful, contrary to the provisions of the law and an exercise in futility.57.The Appellant relied on the case of Kutima Investments Limited vs. Muthoni Kihara & Another (2006} eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that:'The general principle in law is that courts should not act in futility. An order of this Court in favour of the Applicant will not add anything. ""Appellant’s Prayers58.The Appellant prayed that the Tribunal be pleased to issue the following Orders:a.The Appeal herein be allowed, and the Respondent's objection decision dated 12thFebruary 2023, tax assessment dated 15thNovember 2022 and preliminary findings dated 22ndJune 2022 be struck out in entirety;b.A declaration be and is hereby made that the Appellant is not tax resident in Kenya.c.The Respondent, its employees, agents or other persons purporting to act on its behalf be barred and/or estopped from demanding or taking enforcement steps towards recovery of principal tax, penalties and interest on the Respondent’s demand as stipulated above.d.The Respondent be and is hereby restrained from appointing a tax representative for the Appellant and Mr. Taljaard’s appointment as a tax representative of the Appellant be and is hereby revoked.e.The costs of this Appeal be borne by the Respondent.f.The Tribunal be at liberty to grant any other or further remedies that it deems just and reasonable in the circumstances.Respondent’s Case59.The Respondent’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated 20thApril 2023 and filed on 24thApril 2023.60.The Respondent averred that as enjoined by Section 24 of the TPA, it is not bound by information provided by the Appellant in its returns, that it is at liberty to assess for additional taxes based on any other available information.61.The Respondent submitted that Section 2 of theIncome Tax Actprovides that“resident"" when applied in relation­(b)to a body of persons, means-(ii)that the management and control of the affairs of the body was exercised in Kenya in a particular year of income under consideration; or”62.While Section 3(1) of theIncome Tax Actprovides that:“Subject to and in accordance with this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.”63.The Respondent averred that Section 3(2)(a)(i) provides that:“Subject to this Act, income upon which tax is chargeable under this Act is income in respect of-a.gains or profits from-i.any business, for whatever period of time, carried on;”64.The Respondent submitted that the documents provided that for the period under review, the Appellant’s income was in relation to management fees, lease rentals, and dividends.65.The Respondent averred that the Appellant had signed a contract with Rentworks EA to provide the following services:i.The financial modelling of leases to determine residual values of assets and lease periodsii.Develop a benchmark for sale or rent-back optioniii.Scenario analysis of contracts with government and state agencies and other related services.66.The Respondent averred that GMI did not have employees in Mauritius that could deliver the management services; therefore, the logical conclusion was that GMI's management fee income was attributable to the employees in its Kenyan affiliate.67.The Respondent submitted that while the Appellant claimed that any income declared in Mauritius had already been taxed in the source jurisdiction, it was not able to provide documents to support the claim that the lease rental income had already been taxed in Kenya.68.The Respondent submitted that GMI financials indicated that the company had no assets to lease out, so it was not in a position to conduct any leasing business in Mauritius. That it could therefore be inferred that the lease rental income was accrued by the other affiliates of GMI, RentWorks EA, located in Kenya and RentWorks India, PVT located in India.69.The Respondent submitted that it applied the residency test, which is a factual test to determine the tax residency status of GMI. That in this regard, the circumstances relevant to identify the location of a company's management and control include but are not limited to;i.Where the company's meetings, including its director's meetings, are heldii.The residency of the company's directorsiii.The residency of the company's shareholders70.The Respondent averred that during the meetings, the directors stated that board meetings were held in Kenya atleast three or four times annually, and the Appellant failed to provide evidence that the locations of the meetings were outside of Kenya.71.The Respondent submitted that the directors present in Mauritius are nominee directors who have no voting power on key strategic decisions of the company. The Respondent averred that it was therefore inclined to determine that the meetings were held in Kenya by the directors, Mr. Goodall and Mr. Taljaard, thus establishing management and control of the company in Kenya.72.The Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to provide any evidence to show that the strategic decisions were made in Mauritius or that any directors travelled to Mauritius for all the board meetings.73.The Respondent averred that the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the allocation of profits should be aligned with the economic activities that produced the profits. The Respondent further submitted that this provision is to the effect that the income earned by the Appellant was rightfully assessed in Kenya since the economic activities were conducted in Kenya through Rentworks EA.74.The Respondent submitted that it is a requirement under Section 15 (1) of theIncome Tax Actthat for an expense to be allowed for tax purposes, that expense must have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the production of income taxable in Kenya.75.The Respondent submitted that, given that there were no employees or active economic activities in Mauritius, the costs were disregarded due to a lack of support that the expenses were incurred wholly and exclusively in the generation of their income.76.The Respondent averred that the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing) Rules, 2006 at Paragraph9empowers the Commissioner to, where necessary, request a person to whom these rules apply for information, including books of accounts and other documents relating to transactions where transfer pricing is applied.77.The Respondent averred that the tax representative, Mr. Johannes Taljaard, who is the director of Rentworks EA and GMI’s director in Kenya, was appointed in accordance with Section 15 (A) of theTax Procedures Act, which provides that;“Where a person required to appoint a tax representative in accordance with subsection (1) fails to do so, the Commissioner may appoint a tax representative for that person, and the tax representative so appointed shall have the duties and obligations specified under Section 15.”78.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to meet the burden of proof contrary to Section 56(1) of theTax Procedures Act, which provides that in any proceedings, the burden shall be on the Appellant to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.79.The Respondent submitted that it is empowered under Section 59 of theTax Procedures Actto require the production of documents and information to enable the Commissioner to ascertain the tax liability of a person.Respondent’s Prayers80.The Respondent prayed the Tribunal to find that: -i.The Respondent's Objection decision issued on 12thFebruary 2023 demanding a sum of Kshs.488,683,983.00 as properly issued and to uphold the same.ii.This Appeal be dismissed with costs.Issue For Determination81.The Tribunal having considered the pleadings of both parties and the Appellant’s submissions is of the considered view that the issue that calls for determination is Whether the Appellant was liable to taxation in Kenya in theperiod of 2017– 2020.Analysis And Determination82.The Tribunal having determined the issue that falls for its determination proceeds to analyse it as hereunder.83.The Appellant submitted that the assessment of Corporation tax was purportedly based on the provisions of Section 3(1) and 3(2) (a) (i) of theIncome Tax Act(ITA) and the assumption that GMI received income from lease rentals.84.The Appellant submitted that Kenya operates a source-based tax system. That as such, for any income to be taxable in Kenya, it must be accrued in or derived from Kenya as provided for by Section 3(1) of the ITA, the charging Section for income taxes which states as follows:“Subject to, and in accordance with, this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person. whether resident or non-resident which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.""85.The Appellant while relying on the case of Motaku Shipping Agencies Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax [2014) eKLR where Justice Kasango, submitted that for a person's income to be subjected to tax under the ITA, the person's income must be attributable to a Kenyan source, i.e., accrued in or derived from Kenya.86.The Appellant averred that it clearly explained that its income during the period under assessment was obtained from its investments globally and that the only income derived from Kenya, that is from Rentworks EA, were dividend income and management fees, for which tax was duly withheld and remitted at non-resident rates by Rentworks EA.87.The Appellant averred that in issuing the assessment on its entire revenue, the Commissioner was purporting to subject income accrued in and derived from several countries outside Kenya to taxation in Kenya, contrary to the clear provisions of theIncome Tax Act.88.On its part, the Respondent posited that documents adduced showed that the Appellant’s income was in relation to management fees, lease rentals, and dividends yet the Appellant did not have employees in Mauritius that could deliver the management services neither did it own assets to lease out hence the logical conclusion was that the Appellant’s management fee and lease income were attributable to employees and assets in GMI’s affiliates including its Kenyan Affiliate, RentWorks E.A.89.Section 3(1) of theIncome Tax Actprovides as follows regarding income chargeable to tax in Kenya:-“Subject to and in accordance with this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.”90.The Respondent’s assessment of Corporate income tax upon the Appellant is anchored on the premise that in the absence of evidence that the Appellant’s income was derived outside Kenya then it was derived in Kenya through its Kenyan Affiliate RentWorks E.A.91.The Respondent argued further that RentWorks E.A and the Appellant had an agreement for provision of management consultancy services and that since the Appellant did not have employees in Mauritius to deliver the service, the Respondent on that basis that concluded that the services were conducted by RentWorks E.A in Kenya on behalf of the Appellant.92.The Tribunal finds that the Respondent's submission is based on assumption and neither anchored in law nor based on terms of the consultancy agreement. The Tribunal relies on its holding in TAT No. 466 of 2020 TBEA Company Limited vs Commisioner of Domestic taxes where it stated that:“The Tribunal appreciates that the interpretation of contracts is not an invitation to rewrite them but rather an invitation to discern the intentions of the parties so as not to interfere with the 'freedom of contract'. This view was expressed by Lord Hoffman in Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10 where the court stated that: -': .. The court has no power to improve upon the instrument which it is called upon to construe, whether it be a contract, a statute, or articles of association. It cannot introduce terms to make it fairer or more reasonable. It is concerned only to discover what the instrument means ... It is the meaning which the instrument would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would be reasonably available to the audience to whom the instrument is addressed ""93.The Tribunal in its analysis of the documents presented by the Appellant notes that the Appellant had affiliates in various countries including Kenya, India and Zambia who corresponded with the Appellant’s sole shareholder Mr. Goodall on the running of the Appellant’s business. The Respondent was therefore not justified in reaching the conclusion that the Appellant lacked capacity to conduct its business outside Kenya.94.The Appellant explained that being a holding company it did not conduct any business in Kenya directly and that the only income earned from Kenya was dividend from its Affiliate RentWorks E.A for which withholding tax was deducted and remitted by RentWorks E.A.95.Section 3(i) of the ITA is unequivocal that for income to be taxed in Kenya it must have been derived in Kenya, the Tribunal observed that there was no evidence pointing to the Appellant having income generating activities in Kenya.96.The Respondent’s supposition that the Appellant derived income in Kenya through its Affiliate hence it is taxable in Kenya is an overreach by the Respondent given that the Appellant and its affiliate are distinct legal entities liable to be taxed separately.97.The Tribunal therefore finds that the Respondent was not justified in the assessment of Corporation tax on the Appellant.Final Decision98.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is meritorious and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.b.The Respondent’s objection decision dated 12thFebruary 2023 be and is hereby set aside.c.Each party to bear its own costs.99.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

fulfilment of their statutory mandates. Further, the Respondents were and are, entitled to inform the Petitioners of the outcome of their investigations insofar as such outcome will affect the Petitioners. This would include identifying unpaid or apparently unpaid taxes, and requiring the Petitioners, by notice to appear before the 2nd Respondent to produce records and information in respect of the tax liability or for any other purposes relating to a tax law, pursuant to sections 61 and 59 of theTax Procedures Act,""34.That the Appellant failed to avail documentation to enable the Respondent ascertain its tax liability as required under Sections 23, 58 and 59 of theTax Procedures Act.35.That since the Appellant failed to show that the assessments were incorrect, the allegations are just but mere statements as opposed to grounds of objection and thus the Respondent retains its presumption of correctness.36.The Respondent further submitted that under Section 51(3) of theTax Procedures Act, a notice of objection shall be treated as validly lodged by a taxpayer under subsection (2) if-(a)the notice of objection states precisely the grounds of objection, the amendments required to be made to correct the decision, and the reasons for the amendments; and(b)in relation to an objection to an assessment, the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of tax due under the assessment that is not in dispute.”37.That further under Section 51(8) of theTax Procedures Act, 2015, where a notice of objection has been validly lodged within time, the Commissioner shall consider the objection and decide either to allow the objection in whole or in part, or disallow it, and Commissioner's decision shall be referred to as an ""objection decision"".38.The Respondent submitted that Section 51(3) of theTax Procedures Act, 2015 enjoins the Appellant to provide all documents in support of the objection.

Period. If additional documents, which would be reasonably expected to be in his possession is requested for to verify the alleged transactions, he should produce the same to the commissioner. That is what is expected of a keen and diligent trader.""43.The Respondent also relied on the following two cases:-a.Kenya Revenue Authority V Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR Nairobi High Court Income Tax Appeal No. E125 of 2020.b.Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Vs Golden Acre Limited (2021) eKLR the learned judged cited Sheria Sacco Society Limited V Commissioner of Domestic Taxes (2019) eKLR.Respondent’s prayers44.The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal finds that:-a.The Objection decision dated 26thJune, 2023 confirming Income tax for the tax period year 2021 amounting to principal of Kshs 718,814.96 together with the interest and penalty therein be upheld.b.That this Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent as the same is without merit.Issues For Determination45.The Tribunal upon considering the pleadings, facts of the matter and the submissions of the parties has determined that there are two issues falling for its determination as hereunder:-a.Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal.b.Whether the Objection decision dated 26thJune 2023 was justified.Analysis And Determination46.The Tribunal having ascertained the issues crystallizing for its determination as set out above proceeds to deal with the same as hereunder.a.Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal.47.The genesis of the dispute herein is a letter to the Appellant dated 26thJuly 2022 in which the Respondent indicated that it wanted to carry out tax investigations on the Appellant.48.After the investigations, the Respondent issued additional income tax assessments for the year 2021.49.The Appellant was allowed to lodge a late objection to the assessments and did so vide a letter dated 24thApril 2023 but received by the Respondent on 28thApril 2023.50.The Respondent issued its Objection decision on 26thJune 2023.51.Aggrieved by the Objection decision, the Appellant filed this Appeal on 8thAugust 2023.52.The Tribunal notes that the process of lodging an appeal is well laid out in the TPA and the Tax Appeals Tribunal’s Act. The TPA in Section 52(1) lays down as hereunder:-“A person who is dissatisfied with an appealable decision may appeal the decision to the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Appeals Act, 2013”53.Section 13(1) (b) and (2) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 provides as follows:-1.A notice of appeal shall –a.…………..b.Be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.”54.The Section further provides:-2.The Appellant shall, within fourteen days of filing the notice of appeal, submit enough copies, as maybe advised by the Tribunal, of-a.a memorandum of appeal;b.statement of facts; andc.the tax decision .”55.The law also provides that a taxpayer who is not able to file its appeal within the timelines provided, has the option of making an application for time extension within which the appeal could be filed. This is as per the provisions of Section 13(3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actwhich states:-“The Tribunal may, upon application in writing or through electronic means, extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).”56.The Respondent made the decision being appealed on 26thJune 2023. The Appellant was required to file its Notice of Appeal within 30 days. The Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal and the Appeal itself on 8thAugust 2023.57.The Appellant did not seek leave of the Tribunal to file its Appeal out of time or offer any reasons as to why it was late in the circumstances.58.On the basis of the chronology of the matter above-stated, the Appeal was clearly filed out of time.59.The Tribunal has on innumerable occasions emphasized the necessity of the parties to observe the timelines set by the law. The issue has also been determined by the courts as being one of high importance as was held in the case of Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat vs. IEBC & 6 Others [2013] eKLR, where the court held:-“This Court, indeed all courts, must never provide succor and cover to parties who exhibit scant respect for rules and timelines. Those rules and timelines serve to make the process of judicial adjudication and determination fair, just, certain and even-handed. Courts cannot aid in the bending or circumventing of rules and a shifting of goal posts for, while it may seem to aid one side, it unfairly harms the innocent party who strives to abide by the rules. I apprehend that it is in the even-handed and dispassionate application of rules that courts give assurance that there is a clear method in the manner in which things are done so that outcomes can be anticipated with a measure of confidence, certainty and clarity where issues of rules and their application are concerned.”60.The same position was upheld in the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT CASE No. 247 of 2020] where it was held in Paragraph 70 and reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that:“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures”. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”61.The Tribunal is also guided by its holding in TAT Appeal No. 1321 of 2022 CKL Africa Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes where at paragraphs 63 to 65 it held as thus:-63.The law makes provisions under Section 13 (3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actfor any party who lodges its appeal out of time and with reasonable grounds, to seek leave of the Tribunal to file its appeal out if time, the Appellant did not move the Tribunal seeking such Orders.64.The timelines provided under Section 47 (13) of theTax Procedures Actand Section 13 (1) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actdemand strict adherence and are not discretional to any party lodging an appeal before the Tribunal.65.It is the Tribunal’s position that there is no proper and valid Appeal before the Tribunal for the exercise of its jurisdiction.”62.Based on the law and the case laws cited above, the Tribunal finds that the Appeal as filed is not valid as it was filed out of time and without leave of the Tribunal.63.The Tribunal having determined that the Appeal is invalid will not deal with the other issue for determination in this matter as it has been rendered moot.Final Decision64.On the basis of the foregoing analysis the Tribunal finds that the Appeal is incompetent and unsustainable in law and accordingly proceeds to make the Orders as hereunder:a.The Appeal be and is hereby struck outb.Each party to bear its own costs.65.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RD DAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANJEPHTHAH NJAGI EUNICE N.

That the Respondent reviewed the payment plan in its objection decision, where it was revealed that the payment plan was not in regard to the taxes in dispute.41.The Respondent submitted that it is mandated to consider and use the available information to make an assessment of the correct amount of tax payable in line with Section 31 of theTax Procedures Act.42.That the Court in the case of Oliver Merrick Fowler & another v Kenya Revenue Authority [2022] eKLR quoted with authority the case of Saima Khalid vs The Commissioner for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs- Appeal No. TC/2017/02292 and stated:-“... The very use of the word 'judgement’ makes it clear that the commissioners are required to exercise their power in such a way that they make a value judgement on the material which is before them... What the words 'best of their judgement' envisage, in my view is that the commissioners will fairly consider all material placed before them, and on that material come to decision which is one which is reasonable and not arbitrary as to the amount of tax which is due.""43.That the Tribunal in the case of Tenhos Sacco Society Limited V Commissioner of Domestic Taxes TAT No. 413 of 2019 [2022] stated as follows;-“In arriving at its assessments, the above provision does not specify any method or whether that method should be scientific. All it requires is that the Respondent use its best judgment .....what the words ""best of their judgment' envisage, in my view, is that the commissioners will fairly consider all material placed before them and on that material, come to a decision which is reasonable and amount of tax which is due. As long as there is some material on which the commissioner's act then they are not required to carry out investigations which may or may not result in further material being placed before them.""44.The Respondent submitted that in exercise of the aforementioned mandate, it considered the information available and to the best of its judgment assessed the correct tax by disallowing the unsupported zero rated and exempt supplies claimed and issued the notice of assessment by charging them at the general rate.45.The Respondent submitted that contrary to the Appellant’s statement that it was not accorded fair hearing before the issuance of the assessments, the Respondent submitted that it acted within the law by:-a.Issuing a pre- assessment demand notice dated 9thMarch 2023 requiring the Appellant to amend its VAT returns within 7 days.b.The Appellant failed to amend the returns in question and the Respondent issued assessments on 18thApril 2023 after the lapse of the 7 days.c.The Appellant objected to the assessments on 15thMay, 2023.d.The Respondent considered the Appellant’s objection and rendered its decision on 12thJune 2023.46The Respondent submitted that it afforded the Appellant an ample opportunity to contest the assessments within the statutory timelines set out in the provisions of Section 51 of theTax Procedures Act.47.The Respondent further submitted that Section 56(1) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that in any proceedings that relate to tax decisions, objections and Appeals, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.48.That further, Section 30 theTax Appeals Tribunal Actprovides that:-“ln a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving-a.where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; orb.in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.""49.The Respondent submitted that in the case of Ushindi Limited v Commissioner of Investigation and Enforcement Kenya Revenue Authority [2020] eKLR, the Court stated that:-“The burden of proof was on the Appellant to raise the specific items and/or aspects of the tax assessment that were manifest errors, wrongfully imposed or not liable to be paid as tax.""50.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not discharge the burden of proof that the assessments made by the Respondent were incorrect and/or that the documents and/or information relied upon by the Respondent in making the assessment was wrong.51.Respondent submitted that in the case of Digital Box Limited versus Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement [2020] the Tribunal held that: -“The question of burden of proof in taxation matters is provided for under theTax Procedures Actas well as theTax Appeals Tribunal Act. Section 56(7) of theTax Procedures Actstates that: ""In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect. ""Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actsimilarly provides that: ""In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the Appellant has the burden of proving- (a) Where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the Assessment is excessive; or (b) in any other case, that the Tax Decision should not have been made or should have been made differently."" In this case, the Appellant is the one seized of the desire to prove that the Respondent used extraneous information in arriving at its assessment.Thus, according to the provisions of theEvidence Act, theTax Procedures Actand theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, the burden of proof falls upon the Appellant. ... The Tribunal is of the view that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof in showing that the Respondent used extraneous considerations and documents other than those prescribed by the law. The averments made by the Appellant did not amount to evidence.""52.The Respondent submitted that the burden is on the Appellant to prove that the Respondent erred in raising the additional assessments on the under declared sales and mis-declared zero rated & exempt sales. That in doing so, the Appellant must adduce evidence in form of information and/or documents to support its objection.53.That in the case of Republic V KRA: Proto Energy Limited (2022) eKLR the Court stated as follows:-“The most significant justification for placing the burden of proof on the taxpayer is the practical consideration that the Commissioner cannot sustain the burden because he does not possess the needed evidence. Under the system of self­ reporting tax liability, the taxpayer possesses the evidence relevant to the determination of tax liability. It is simply fair to place the burden of persuasion on the taxpayer, given that he knows the facts relating to his liability, because the commissioner must rely on circumstantial evidence, most of it coming from the taxpayer and the taxpayer's records. The taxpayer must present a minimum amount of information necessary to support his position. This safety valve seems to place the burden of production on the taxpayer without relieving the Commissioner of the overall burden of proof. The taxpayer’s evidence must meet this minimum threshold.""54.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant had the responsibility to maintain records and avail them when requested to do so. The Appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof by failing to provide documents in support of its objection.55.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant merely pleaded that the assessments were erroneous and the VAT exempt and zero-rated sales should be allowed without providing documents in support.Respondent’s prayers56.The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal:a.Upholds the Respondent’s decision as proper and in conformity with the provisions of the law.b.Dismisses the Appeal with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid any merit.Issues For Determination57.The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the Respondent and considers the issues for determination to be as follows:-a.Whether the Respondent was justified in issuing the additional assessments.b.Whether the Appellant has discharged its burden of proof.Analysis And Findings.58.Having identified the issues that fall for its determination, the Tribunal proceeds to analyse them as hereunder.59.The genesis of this dispute is the tax compliance audit carried out by the Respondent on the Appellant for the year of income 2022. As a result of this audit, the Respondent wrote to the Appellant on 9thMarch 2023 asking it to amend its “VAT returns and declare the correct taxable supplies.”60.The Respondent submitted that because the Appellant did not comply with the notice, it issued additional VAT assessments of Kshs. 1,662,244.71 on 18thApril 2023.61.The Appellant objected to the additional VAT assessments on 15thMay 2023 and the Respondent issued an objection decision on 12thJune 2023. Aggrieved by the objection decision, the Appellant filed this Appeal.a). Whether the Respondent was justified in issuing the additional assessments.62.In its Statement of Facts, the Appellant contended that the Respondent did not consider the documents that it provided. Indeed in its paragraph 3 of the Statement of Facts, the Appellant stated as follows:-“The business is entirely owned by a single Kenyan Director whose major area of business operations is sales of cereals, farm produce and mixes up with hotel industry thus making it difficult to differentiate between the company operations and the director’s operations.”63.The Tribunal notes that Section 23(1) (a) and (b), of theTax Procedures Actrequires a taxpayer to keep records. The Section states that:-“(1)A Person shall---a.Maintain any document required under a tax law, in either of the official languages;b.Maintain any document required under a tax law so as to enable the person’s tax liability to be readily ascertained;”64Further, the Tribunal notes that Section 54A (1) of theIncome Tax Actalso requires a taxpayer to keep records of its business transactions. The Section states as follows:-“A person carrying on a business shall keep records of all receipts and expenses, goods purchased and sold and accounts, books, deeds, contracts and vouchers which in the opinion of the Commissioner, are adequate for the purpose of computing tax.”65.The Tribunal also notes that Sections 58 ad 59 of theTax Procedures Act2015, give the Respondent powers to inspect records and to require a taxpayer to produce such records. The Sections state:-“Power to inspect goods, records etc.1.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any written law, an authorised officer may inquire into the affairs of a person under any tax law, and shall at all times have full and free access to all lands, buildings, places to inspect all goods, equipment, devices and records whether in the custody or control of a public officer, or of a body corporate or of any other person, and may make extracts from or copies of those records2.An officer acting under subsection 1) may require the owner or employee, or a representative of the owner of the business, to give him all assistance and to answer all questions relating to the inquiry.66.Production of records1.For the purposes of obtaining full information in respect of the tax liability of any person or class of persons, or for any other purposes relating to a tax law, the Commissioner or an authorised officer may require any person, by notice in writing, to-(a)produce for examination, at such time and place as may be specified in the notice any documents (including in electronic format) that are in the persons custody or under the person’s control relating to the tax liability of any person.67.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to provide evidence of zero rated and exempt supplies at the point of review and as such, the Respondent was justified in raising the assessments in order to tax the Appellant’s supplies under the standard rate and to bring the under-declared sales to charge.68.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant attached various documents to its pleadings. But no evidence was tendered that the documents were provided to the Respondent and that the Respondent failed or refused to review them.69.The Tribunal is guided by the Court of Appeal holding in CMC Aviation Ltd v Kenya Airways Ltd (Cruisair Ltd) [1978] eKLR where the Court faulted the reliance on averments as evidence in arriving at a decision. The Court stated as follows:-“The pleadings contain the averments of the parties concerned. Until they are proved, or disproved, or there is admission of them or any of them by the parties, they are not evidence and no decision could be founded upon them. Proof is the foundation of evidence. As stated in the definition of “evidence” in section 3 of theEvidence Act, evidence denotes the means by which an alleged matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted to investigation, is proved or disproved. Averments are matters the truth of which is submitted for investigation. Until their truth has been established or otherwise they remain unproven. Averments in no way satisfy, for example, the following definition of “evidence” in Cassell’s English Dictionary, p 394:Anything that makes clear or obvious; ground for knowledge, indication or testimony; that which makes truth evident, or renders evident to the mind that it is truth.The pleadings in a suit are not normally evidence. They may become evidence if they are expressly or impliedly admitted as then the admission itself is evidence. Evidence is usually given on oath. Averments are not made on oath. Averments depend upon evidence for proof of their contents.”70.Since the Appellant did not give evidence of the documents that it may have supplied to the Respondent which were not considered in arriving at the decision to issue additional VAT assessments, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was justified in issuing the additional assessments.b). Whether the Appellant has discharged its burden of proof.71.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to discharge its burden of proof by failing to provide relevant supporting information and documents that would be used to support its claim for zero rated and exempt sales.72.The Tribunal notes that The Respondent invoked Section 56 of the TPA which provides that:-“(1)In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.2.An appeal to the High Court or Court of Appeal shall be on question of law only.”73.This Section places the burden of proof in tax cases on the taxpayer. The Section is reinforced by Section 30 of the TAT Act which states that:-“In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving---a.where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; orb.in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently”74.The Tribunal is guided by the holding of the Court in Kenya Revenue Authority v Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR wherein the Court stated that:-“The import of the above provisions is that the party with the obligation of persuasion (what Wigmore termed the risk of non-persuasion) is said to bear the burden of proof.[9]The flip side of the foregoing is the effect of non-persuasion on a party with the burden of proof which is that the particular issue at stake in the litigation will be decided against him/her. Generally, the taxpayer has the burden of proof in any tax controversy.The taxpayer must demonstrate that the commissioner's assessment is incorrect. The taxpayer has a significantly higher burden. The taxpayer must prove the assessment is incorrect. The shifting of the burden of proof in tax disputes flows from the presumption of correctness which attaches to the Commissioner's assessments or determinations of deficiency.[10]The commissioner's determinations of tax deficiencies are presumptively correct. Although the presumption created by the above provisions is not evidence in itself, the presumption remains until the taxpayer produces competent and relevant evidence to support his position.”75.The Tribunal also relies on Section 107 (1) of theEvidence Act(Cap 80 Laws of Kenya) which states as follows:-“Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.”76.Section 109 of theEvidence Actwhich further provides as thus:-“The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person”77.After the review of the documents submitted by the parties, the law and the case laws cited above, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof and the Respondent was therefore justified in confirming the additional VAT assessments.Final Decision78.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal lacks merit and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following final Orders:-a.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 12thJune 2023 be and is hereby upheld.c.Each party to bear its own costs.79.It is so orderedDATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RDDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -  CHAIRMANJEPHTHAH NJAGI - -MEMBERUNICE N.

Mayaka & T Vikiru, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenCar and General Trading LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Customs and Border ControlRespondentJudgmentBackground1.The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated in Kenya pursuant to the provisions of theCompanies Act. Its main business activity is supply of power generation, automotive, construction and industrial engineering products.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, the Authority is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting, and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.3.The Respondent conducted a post clearance audit on the Appellant and subsequently issued a demand notice vide a letter dated 30thMarch 2023 for total taxes amounting to Kshs 224,693,908.00 comprising Import duty, Excise duty and VAT.4.The Appellant made an application for review of the Respondent’s demand vide a letter dated 28thApril, 2023.5.The Respondent subsequently issued its review decision vide a letter dated 25thMay 2023 confirming the assessments.6.The Appellant being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s review decision, lodged a Notice of Appeal dated 6thJune 2023.The Appeal7.The Appeal according to the Memorandum of Appeal is premised on the following grounds:i.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by confirming the assessment on the Appellant's product contrary to the Respondent's own advance ruling.ii.That the Respondent erred in law and fact in classifying the Appellant's product under Heading 8711 in spite of its own Advance Ruling directing that the Appellant's product fell under Heading 8703.iii.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to appreciate that the demand notice dated 30thMarch 2023 cannot be based onCommissioner Customs and Border Control v Auto Industries Limited, Tax Appeal No. E008 of 2022(Auto Industries Case), since the periods as well as circumstances of the demand notice and the above cited case are different.iv.That the Respondent erred in law and fact in failing to recognize that the Respondent had lodged an appeal at the High Court against the Appellant inCommissioner of Customs and Border Control v Car &General Trading Limited, Tax Appeal No. E012 of 2021(High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021), wherein the Respondent demanded that the Appellant comply with the provisions of the Advanced Ruling and classify the product under Heading 8703 and Heading 8704.v.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in failing to appreciate the provisions of Section 248A of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 (EACCMA). That the said Section provides that the Respondent shall within 30 days of receipt of the sufficient information issue an advanced ruling and that the same shall be binding on the Respondent and the Applicant for a period not exceeding 12 months.vi.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in failing to appreciate that the Advance Ruling issued pursuant to Section 248A of EACCMA, cannot be reversed by the demand notice dated 30thMarch 2023.vii.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in failing to appreciate that its Advance Ruling issued to the Appellant created a legitimate expectation in relation to the tariff classification of the Appellant's products and which was relied upon by the Appellant.Appellant’s Case8.The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents filed before the Tribunal;i.The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 15thJune 2023 and filed on 21stJune, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.ii.The Appellant’s written submissions dated 16thFebruary 2024 and filed on 20thFebruary 2024.9.The Appellant stated that the Respondent reclassified the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers (the Appellant's product) from Heading 8711 to 8703 and Heading 8704 for the period November 2015 to October 2020. That having been dissatisfied by this decision, the Appellant appealed against the Respondent's decision in Tax Appeal No. 23 of 2021 Car and General Trading Limited v Commissioner of Customs and Border Control Department (TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021).The Appellant stated that it had been importing the Product under Heading 8711 since the year 2003 and demonstrated to the Tax Appeals Tribunal that during that period the Appellant's product qualified for classification under Heading 8711.10.That during the pendency of TAT Appeal No.23 of 2021, due to the uncertainty created by the Respondent's new position and the potential additional taxes and late payment penalties and interest that the Appellant would have to incur should the Tribunal find in favor of the Respondent, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent on 12thMay, 2021 seeking an Advance Ruling on the applicable tariff for the Appellant's product.11.That the Respondent, being fully aware of the Appeal pending before the Tribunal, provided a Ruling via a letter dated 25thJune, 2021 (the Advance Ruling). That in the Advance Ruling, the Respondent stated as follows:“Based on the above information, the three-wheeler tuk-tuks in CKD with spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine, of a cylinder capacity not exceeding 1,000 cc, unassembled, are classifiable in EAC CET 2017 HS Code 8703.21.10 as guided by GIRs 1,2 (a) and 6.""12.That in addition, the Advance Ruling, in its last paragraph stated that it was valid for one (1) year from 25thJune 2021.13.It averred that in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021, the Tribunal, having been satisfied with the Appellant's arguments, found in favor of the Appellant and dismissed the Respondent's decision to reclassify the Appellant's product to Headings 8703 and 8704 for the period November 2015 to October 2020 vide a decision issued on 15thOctober 2021.14.That being dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021, the Respondent appealed against the Tribunal's decision at the High Court, inCommissioner of Customs and Border Control v Car & General Trading Limited, Tax Appeal No. E012 of 2021(High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021) on 16thDecember 2021.15.That however, before the case under High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021 could be determined by the High Court, another case,Commissioner Customs and Border Control v Auto Industries Limited, Tax Appeal No. E008 of 2022(Auto Industries Case), which had similar facts, was determined on 30thNovember 2022. That the Court found that the product, (which was similar to the Appellant's product) was correctly classifiable under Heading 8711 for the period February 2015 to January 2020.16.The Appellant submitted that following the Judgment in the Auto Industries Case, on 16thMarch 2023, the Respondent wrote to C & G's legal representatives, Coulson Harney LLP, requesting to withdraw their appeal under the High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021 (the Respondent's Request for Withdrawal). That in particular, the Respondent's Request for Withdrawal stated that:“Please note in light of the decision inCommissioner of Customs & Border Control v Auto Industries Limited H.C.I.T.C. No E008 of 2022and after further consultation with our client, we wish to withdraw the subject Appeal under the terms of the draft consent enclosed.""17.That accordingly, the Appellant and the Respondent filed a Consent at the High Court and the matter under the High Court Appeal No, E012 of 2021 was then marked as closed on 18thApril 2023 on the basis of the Consent. That the effect of the Consent was that the additional tax demanded for the period November 2015 to October 2020 was vacated by the Respondent.18.That subsequently, the Respondent conducted a desk audit on the importation records of the Appellant's product for the period January 2022 to January 2023 (the audit period). That upon finalization of the audit, the Respondent raised the material demand notice for the amount of Ksh 224,693,908 comprised of Import duty, Excise duty and Value Added Tax (VAT) via its letter dated 30thMarch 2023 as tabulated below:Tax headAmount assessed-KESImport duty160,684,030Excise duty35,435,382VAT28,574,49619.The Appellant averred that as per the demand notice, the basis of the additional taxes was as follows:a.That as per the Tax Appeals Tribunal's decision in TAT No. 23 of 2021, the Appellant had taken the position that the Appellant's product qualified under Heading 8711 and the Tribunal upheld the said position that the Appellant's product was correctly classifiable under tariff heading 8711;b.That as per the High Court's decision in the Auto Industries Case, the Court held that the same product as imported by another entity, Auto Industries Limited, was classifiable under tariff Heading 8711; andc.That both parties entered the Consent to withdraw the case under High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021.20.The Appellant stated that it lodged an application for review of the Respondent's decision per the demand notice through a letter dated 28thApril, 2023. That as per the application for review, the Appellant opposed the assessment of additional taxes on the Appellant's product on the premise that the Appellant relied on the Advance Ruling in relation to the declaration in the audit period and that the demand notice cannot be based on the decision per the Auto Industries case as the Auto Industries case covered a period different from the audit period.21.That subsequently, the Respondent issued its review decision on 25thMay, 2023, wherein the Respondent confirmed its assessment per the demand notice on its entirety.22.The Appellant submitted that it relied on the Advance Ruling issued by the Respondent in applying Heading 8703 for the audit period.23.That from the onset, it was important to note and distinguish between the different audit periods covered by the different cases, the circumstances and events that occurred in between the periods, in order to arrive at the correct position with regard to the classification of the Appellant's product. That the said cases relate to the respective audit periods as follows:a.TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021- audit period November 2015 to October 2020. Car & General lodged this Appeal on 10thFebruary 2021, and Judgment was rendered on 15thOctober 2021;b.High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021-audit period November 2015 to October 2020. This Appeal was lodged by the Respondent on 6thDecember 2021.c.Auto Industries Case-audit period February 2015 to January 2020. The KRA lodged this appeal on 10thDecember 2021, and Judgment was rendered on 30thNovember 2022.24.That the present demand letter relates to the audit period, that is January 2022 to January 2023.25.That given the uncertainty created by the Respondent's position and the potential costs that would have been incurred had the Tribunal found in favor of the Respondent in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent on 12thMay 2021 seeking a Ruling on the applicable tariff on the Appellant's product.26.That the Advance Ruling provided clarity on the way forward, and it was on the basis of the same that the Appellant changed the classification of the product from Heading 8711 to Heading 8703 in order to align with the Respondent's position going forward.27.That the Appellant brings to the attention of the Tribunal Section 248A of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 (EACCMA) which provides for applications for advance rulings as follows:“(1)(a)- A person intending to import goods, may make a written application to the Commissioner for advance binding rulings on tariff classification;(3)- The Commissioner shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of the sufficient information issue an advance ruling or give reasons for the inability to issue an advance ruling on the application; and(4)- The decision issued under subsection () shall be binding on the Commissioner and the applicant for a period not exceeding twelve months.""28.That in relation to the present audit period to which the demand relates, the above process was followed. That the law is clear under Section 248A (4) cited above that the decision communicated in an Advance Ruling is binding on the Commissioner.29.That the legal effect of the exercise of power by the Commissioner under Section 248A of EACCMA is that the Ruling cannot be reversed by the Respondent's demand notice dated 30thMarch 2023 or the decision in the Auto Industries Case. The Appellant stated that it had a legal basis to apply Heading 8703, being the Advance Ruling, and indeed, went on to apply that Heading on its imports for the audit period in question. That the Advance Ruling created a legitimate expectation which the Appellant relied on.30.That the principle of legitimate expectation has long been established and ruled upon by Courts the world over, including Kenyan courts. That in the case of National Director of Public Prosecutions v Phillips and Others. [2002] (4) SA 60 (W) paragraph28, it was stated as follows:“The law does not protect every expectation but only those which are 'legitimate'. The requirements for legitimacy of the expectation, include the following:a)The representation underlying the expectation must be 'clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification;b)The expectation must be reasonable;c)The representation must have been induced by the decision-maker;d)The representation must be one which it was competent and lawful for the decision-maker to make without which the reliance cannot be legitimate.""31.That similarly, in Communications Commission of Kenya & 5 Others v Royal Media Services & 5 Others [2014]e KLR, the Supreme Court of Kenya stated that:-“Legitimate expectation would arise when a body, by representation or by past practice, has aroused an expectation that is within its power to fulfil. Therefore, for an expectation to be legitimate,it must be founded upon a promise or practice by public authority that is expected to fulfil the expectation.""32.According to the Appellant, under Section 5(1) of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Chapter 469 Laws of Kenya (the KRA Act), the KRA is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue in Kenya. That further, under Section 5(2) of the said Act, with respect to the performance of its functions under subsection (1), the KRA is required to administer and enforce all provisions of the written laws set out in Part 1 & 2 of the First Schedule to the Act for the purposes of assessing, collecting and accounting for all revenues in accordance with those laws. That further, under Part 1 of the First Schedule to theKenya Revenue Authority Act, one of the laws the Kenya Revenue Authority enforces is the EACCMA.33.That from the foregoing, it was not in doubt or a fact in issue that the Respondent is a public body, which has the power to make decisions that would affect the public, and to collect taxes in accordance with those decisions. That its actions, whether express or by conduct therefore, have the ability to create legitimate expectations based on its actions and conduct on the public. That based on the legitimate expectation, the Appellant proceeded to make immense investments on the its Products.34.The Appellant asserted that the current demand cannot be based on the Judgment in the Auto Industries case.35.It explained that the demand notice based its conclusion that the correct Heading for the Appellant's product was 8711 on the decision in the Auto Industries Case. That this was a misdirection since, while the product is the same as that which was the subject matter of the case, the time periods are different, and so are the circumstances under which the Appellant changed its product HS classification.36.That the Appeals under both TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021 and the Auto Industries Case were filed in response to KRA's abrupt change in tariff classification for past periods between the years 2015 and 2020. That the defenses argued in those cases were in support of the application of Heading 8711 for those periods, and both the Tribunal (in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021) and the High Court (in the Auto Industries Case) found that the taxes as demanded by the Respondent were not due.37.That the demand notice fails to take into account two factors namely:a.That the decisions in both TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021 and the Auto Industries Case dealt with historical issues, and were rendered after both the Appellant and Auto Industries Case had satisfied the Court that Heading 8711 applied for the periods to which the two cases related; andb.That following the lodging of the Appeal at the Tribunal by the Appellant in February 2021, in order to protect its future imports, it submitted an application for an Advance Ruling on the correct classification for the Appellant's product. That this Advance Ruling was granted, and the Appellant then made a decision to start applying Heading 8703 to avoid any future disruptions to its business.38.That it should be noted that the application for the Advance Ruling had nothing to do with the cases filed at the Tribunal, and subsequently at the High Court. That the court cases were lodged against demands that were issued in the past 5 years and were meant to justify why Heading 8711 had been used in the past. That on the other hand, the application for Advance Ruling was meant to provide certainty going forward.39.That in addition, given the ambiguity with regards to classification of the Appellant's products, not only in Kenya but across many other jurisdictions, the Appellant relied on the TAT's decision at the time. That subsequently, the issuance of the Advance Ruling by the Respondent created legitimate expectation that the correct code for the company to apply going forward was under Heading 8711.40.It stated that there was therefore no link between the decisions of the Tribunal and the High Court, and the company's current application of HS Code 8703.Appellant’s Prayers41.The Appellant prayed that the Tribunal;i.Sets aside the assessment and demand of Ksh 224,693,908.00 issued via a letter dated 30thMarch 2023.ii.Awards costs of the Appeal.Respondents Case42.The Respondent’s case is premised on the following filed documents and before the Tribunal.i.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 20thJuly 2023 and filed on 21stJuly 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.ii.The Respondent written submissions dated 23rdFebruary 2024 and filed on the same date.43.According to the Respondent, the details to this dispute was canvased in TAT No 83 of 2021 between the same parties and a Judgement delivered in favor of the Appellant on 15thOctober 2021.44.That the observations and holding in the TAT No 83 of 2021 was applied in a subsequent similar matter in Auto Industries Limited vsCommissioner of Customs & Border Control TAT No 21 of 2021where a Judgement was delivered on 12thNovember 2021, with this holding being upheld by the High Court in Nairobi High Court Income Tax Appeal NO. E008 OF 2022: Commissioner of Customs & Border Control versus Auto Industries Limited on 30thNovember 2022.45.The Respondent stated that it reclassified the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers (the Appellant's product) from Heading 8711 to 8703 and Heading 8704 for the period November 2015 to October 2020. That having been dissatisfied by this decision, the Appellant appealed against the Respondent's decision in Tax Appeal No. 23 of 2021 Car and General Trading Ltd V Commissioner of Customs and Border Control Department (TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021). That the Appellant alleged that it had been importing its product under heading 8711 since 2003.46.That during the pendency of Tax Appeal No.23 of 2021, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent on 12thMay 2021 seeking an Advance ruling on the applicable tariff for the Appellant's product.47.The Respondent stated that it provided a ruling via a letter dated 25thJune 2021 (the Advance Ruling). That in the Ruling, it stated as follows:-“based on the above information, the three-wheeler tuk-tuks in CKD with spark-ignition internal combustion reciprocating piston engine of cylinder capacity not exceeding 1,000 cc, unassembled are classified in EAC CET 2017 HS Code 8703.21.10 as guided by GIRs 1, 2 (a) and 6.”48.That the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's decision to reclassify the Appellant's product to Headings 8703 and 8704 for the period November 2015 to October 2020 vide a decision issued on 15thOctober 2021.49.That the Respondent being dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021 appealed against the Tribunal's decision in the High Court, in Commissioner of Customs and Border Control vs Car and General Trading Ltd (High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021).50.That however, before High Court Appeal No. E012 of 2021 could be determined, another caseCommissioner Customs and Border Control v Auto Industries Ltd, Tax Appeal No.E008 of 2022which had similar facts was determined (similar Appellant's product) the Respondent filed a Consent to withdraw the Appeal in the High Court, the demand in this case was for the period February 2015 to January 2020.51.That subsequently, the Respondent conducted a desk audit on the importation records of its product for the period January 2022 to January 2023. That upon finalization of the audit the Respondent raised the material demand notice for the Ksh 224,693,908.000 for the period January 2022 to January 2023 comprising of Import duty, Excise duty and Value Added Tax on 30thMarch 2023 and further a review decision dated 25thMay 2023. That this was in addition to the World Customs Organization (WCO) Ruling dated 7thOctober 2022.52.It was the Respondent’s view that the issues for determination could be summarized as:i.Whether the reclassification as carried out by the Respondent was within the law for the period January 2022 to January 2023ii.Whether the Respondent erred in law in demanding taxes contrary to its Advance Ruling dated 25thJune 2021 and did the Advance Ruling create a legitimate expectation vis a vis the pendency of the dispute and the Judgment delivered on 15thOctober 2021 which taxes were for the period November 2015 to October 2020.53.The Respondent urged these issues as follows:i. Whether the reclassification as carried out by the Respondent was within the law for the period January 2022 to January 202354.The Respondent stated that the power to reclassify goods for tax purposes lies with the Respondent as was held in Republic vs. KRA ex parte Harsh Avadan & Others Civil Appeal No. 153 of 2007, Republic vs. KRA ex parte Beta Heathcare International Ltd HC Misc. Application No. 4 of 2009and Republic vs. KRA ex parte Metro Pharmaceuticals Limited HC Misc.Application No.108 of 2011.55.That the issue of legitimate expectation is that a promise made to a party by a public body that it will act or not act in a certain manner and for the promise to hold, the same must be made within the confines of law since a public body cannot make a promise which goes against the express letter of the law as stated in the case of Republic vs. Kenya Revenue Authority Ex parte Shake Distributors Limited [2012] eKLR.56.The Respondent stated that the demand for taxes was made in compliance with the TAT Judgement delivered on 15thOctober 2021 upholding the Appellant’s classification of the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers (the Appellant's Product) under Heading 8711.57.That the Tax Appeal Tribunal Judgement which the Respondent was complying with held as below;“Based on the facts before it, the Tribunal pursuant to GIR 3(c) and GIR 4found that Piaggio Ape three-wheeler vehicles imported by the Appellant did not meet the design characteristics of vehicles of heading 87 03 and 87 04 and were most appropriately classifiable under HS 87 11.The Tribunal accordingly determined that the Respondent erred in classifying the three-wheel vehicles imported by the Appellant under HS87 03 and 8704.”58.The Respondent stated that the current demand is based on the reclassification of the Appellant’s imports based on the decision in TAT No 83 of 2021 and was specifically for the period January 2022 to January 2023 and not based on the Auto Industries Judgment as advanced by the Appellant notwithstanding that the cases are similar and involve Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers. That in addition, the taxes being demanded substantially dropped from Ksh 1,194,383,014.00 to Ksh 224,693,908.00ii. Whether the Respondent erred in law in demanding taxes contrary to its advance ruling dated 25thJune 2021 and did the advance ruling create a legitimate expectation vis a vis the pendency of the dispute and the Judgement delivered on 15thOctober 2021 which taxes were for the period November 2015 to October 2020.59.The Respondent stated that the EACCMA is a valid law that it derives its force from the provisions of Article 8 of the Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community, 2000 and that Section 135(3) of EACCMA empowers the Respondent to carry out post clearance audits and demand for short levied duty within 5 years.60.That in its letter dated 25thJune 2021, it was informing the Appellant of the tariff classification of the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers noting and as observed by the Tribunal in TAT No 23 of 2021.61.The Respondent stated that even if the letter dated 25thJune 2021 could be classified as an advance ruling, it did not comply with provisions of Section 248A of EACCMA.62.That Section 248A of EACCMA provides that it is important to provide sufficient information when making the request. That the Section provides as follows;“(1)A person intending to import goods, may make a written application to the Commissioner for advance binding rulings on any of the following -(a)tariff classification;(b)rules oforigin;or(c)customs valuation.(2)Subject to subsection (1) and upon direction from the Commissioner, the applicant shall furnish to the Commissioner sufficient information that may be used to make the decision.(3)The Commissioner shall within thirty days of receipt of the sufficient information issue an advance ruling or give reasons for the inability to issue an advance ruling on the application.(4)The decision issued under subsection (3) shall be binding on the Commissioner and the applicant for a period not exceeding twelve months.”63.That the Respondent on the issue of legitimate expectation created by the Advance Ruling associates itself with the holding in Tarmal Industries Ltd -vs- Commissioner of Customs and Excise where the High Court was examining a similar situation where the Commissioner of Customs had misadvised on the tariffs goods were dutiable under and the importer relied on the Commissioner's advice. That the court had this to say;“It would be the duty of the Commissioner to classify the substance under tariff item 105 which attracts duty, rather that under tariff 108(k) which does not. The fact that he failed to do s, on the authorities above cite, cannot estope him from carrying out his duty when he discovers the original error. Indeed his earlier classification under item 108(k) was in breach of s. 105 of the East African Customs Management Act. It was in breach of a statutory duty, and in that sense it was not lawful and estoppel cannot be raised against him to prevent him from correcting that act.”64.On the question of legitimate expectation, the Respondent relied on the Supreme Court Case of Kenya Revenue Authority vs Export Trading Company Limited Petition No 202 of 2020where it was observed that;“Further according to De Smith Woolf & Jowell, ""Judicial Review of Administrative Action ""6th Edn. Sweet & Maxwell page 609; “A legitimate expectation arises where a person responsible for taking a decision has induced in someone a Petition No.20 of2020-22- reasonable expectation that he will receive or retain a benefit of advantage."" [52] As can be discerned from these two definitions, legitimate expectation may take many forms. It may take the form of an expectation to succeed in a request placed before the decision maker or it may take the objective form that a party may legitimately expect that, before a decision that may be prejudicial is taken, one shall be afforded a hearing. [53] Respectfully, we take the view that the question of whether a legitimate expectation arose is more than a factual question. It is not merely confined to whether an expectation exists in the mind of an aggrieved party, but whether viewed objectively, such expectation is in a legal sense, legitimate. [54] This is the position taken by this Court in the CCK Case where it was held that legitimate expectation would arise when a body, by representation or by past practice, has aroused an expectation that is within its power to fulfil. For an expectation to be legitimate therefore, it must be founded upon a promise or practice by a public authority that is expected to fulfil the expectation. We then went on to find the emerging principles on legitimate expectation to be that; “a. there must be an express, clear and unambiguous promise given by a public authority; b. the expectation itself must be reasonable; c. the representation must be one which it was competent and lawful for the decision-maker to make; and (d) there cannot be a legitimate expectation against clear provisions of the law orthe Constitution.""65.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant was in clear breach of Article 201(b)(i) ofthe Constitutionof Kenya, 2010 as all along it had indicated that its classification of its product under HS 8711 was correct, a fact affirmed by both the Tax Appeal Tribunal and High Court.66.The Respondent further stated that on the 30thMarch 2023, it issued a demand notice of Kshs. 224,693,908.00 arising from the tariff reclassification of the three-wheeler motor vehicles from tariff Heading 8703 to tariff Heading 8711. That the Appellant being a licensed assembler of motor vehicles, had imported the three wheelers completely knocked down (CKD) and enjoyed remission of both Import and Excise duties under tariff subheading 8703. That tariff Heading 8711 attracted 25% Import duty and a specific Excise duty regardless of the form the vehicles were imported in.67.That the reclassification was founded in the determination made by the Tribunal on TAT no. 83 of 2021 on 15thOctober 2021. That a similar determination on the tariff reclassification of the three wheelers was made by the High Court Judgment issued on 30thNovember 2021. That the Appellant applied for a review of the decision in a letter dated 28thApril 2023 citing the following reasons.i.That they relied on an Advance Ruling given by the KRA in applying Heading 8703 for the audit period. That this created a legitimate expectation on the Commissioner.ii.That the current demand could not be based on the Judgement in the Auto Industries case.68.The Respondent stated that the Commissioner issued the review decision that upheld the taxes assessed on 25thMay 202369.That by its own admission, the Appellant averred that given the ambiguity with regards to the classification of its products and the uncertainty created by the Respondent's position and the potential costs that would have been incurred had the Tribunal found in favor of the Respondent in TAT Appeal No. 83 of 2021, it wrote to the Respondent on 12thMay 2021 seeking a ruling on the applicable tariff on its product. That the Advance Ruling was issued on 25thJune 2021.70.That it was important to note that the matter was still under litigation during this period. That the Appellant failed to disclose this to the KRA during application. That the position held by the Commissioner in the Advance Ruling was however invalidated by the Appellant's own Tribunal determination on 15thOctober 2021.71.That the scope of this Appeal is January 2022 to January 2023. It averred that the Appellant was legitimately expected to abide by the determination made by the TAT which cleared any uncertainty, ambiguity it had and any potential costs to be incurred at the time. That the Tribunal concluded as below:“The Tribunal analysed the features described by the Respondent and found nothing in the submission excluded the Piaggio Ape three-wheeler from being classified under HS 8711. In fact, it was the Appellant's submission that clearly distinguished the vehicles from being classified under either HS 8703 or 8704......Based on the facts before it, the Tribunal pursuant to GIR 3(c)and GIR 4 found that Piaggio Ape three-wheeler vehicles imported by the Appellant did not meet the design characteristics of vehicles of heading 8703 and 8704 and were most appropriately classifiable under HS 8711.""72.The Respondent stated that similar matter aforementioned was determined at the High Court which concluded that the Respondent (Auto Industries Limited), provided pima facie and unrebutted proof that the Tuk Tuks have a handle steering as opposed to the motor car type of steering system, that they have a differential that is different from that of a car, that they have a monocoque chassis as opposed to a T-type chassis and that they do not have a single central control stick as the gears are operated from the handle bar type steering. That these features are not characteristics of vehicles under tariff heading 8703 which as per the Explanatory Notes in tariff Heading 8703 means they fall under tariff Heading 8711.73.That the Auto Industries Limited case only emphasized the Commissioner's position but was not the sole basis for the tax assessment in this matter.74.That the Appellant's attempt to delink the current matter to the matter determined by the Tribunal and the High Court in 2021 and 2022 respectively, had no basis. That the difference in scope does not mean a difference in product.75.It was the Respondent’s submission that the Piaggio Ape three wheelers have not changed in structural and mechanical forms to warrant a change in the tariff classification. That the Appellant did not prove otherwise.76.That the Respondent was guided bythe Constitutionand the EACCMA, 2004.77.It averred that tax and customs jurisprudence envisages that a decision made by the Commissioner can be appealed to the subordinate and superior courts of law in Kenya upon application by the affected person. That the same jurisprudence allowed the Appellant to appeal the Commissioner's review decision to the TAT. That the Advance Ruling of tariff Heading 8703 was issued on 25thJune 2021 and was binding to the Commissioner for a period not exceeding 12 months as per Section 248 (4) of the EACCMA, 2004.78.The Respondent submitted that the Tribunal Ruling (TAT 83 of 2021) of tariff Heading 8711 was issued on 15thOctober 2021. That the three wheelers were imported from January 2022, two months after the TAT determination. That it was therefore the Respondent’s position that the determination by the TAT should have taken precedence, especially given that the merits and demerits of the subject goods were well articulated in the previous cases. That the Respondent's Advance Ruling was invalidated by the Tribunal's Ruling. That the Appellant was legitimately expected to abide by this determination and cannot therefore legitimately expect the Respondent to uphold a position contrary to the Tribunal's determination.79.That the decision by the Tribunal was the basis for the assessment and it was further emphasized in the High Court ruling. That it was in favor of the Respondent in this case.80.The Respondent stated that it relied on the following provisions of the law;a.Sections 135, 229, 235, 236 of the EACCMA 2004.b.Sections 235 and 236 which gives the Commissioner powers to call for documents and conduct a PCA on the import and export operations of a taxpayer within a period of five years from the date of importation or exportation. That where the PCA reveals that taxes were short levied, or erroneously refunded, Section 135 empowers the Commissioner to recover any such amount short levied or erroneously refunded.c.Section 229 which provides for application for review by any person affected by the decision or omission of the Commissioner on matters relating to Customs and provides the statutory timelines to be observed.Respondent’s Prayers81.The Respondent prayed that;i.The Appeal be dismissed with costs.ii.The Commissioner’s review decision and demand notice dated 30thMarch 2023 be upheldIssue for Determination82.The Appeal herein raises only one issue for determination namely; Whether the Respondent erred in its demand for additional taxes from the Appellant for the period January 2022 to January 2023.Analysis and Determination83.Having identified the issue for its determination, the Tribunal proceeds to analyze the same as hereunder.84.At the heart of this dispute is the Respondent’s demand for additional taxes for imports of Piaggio Ape three wheelers imported by the Appellant during the period January 2022 to January 2023.85.Before delving into the issue in dispute, the Tribunal notes the following events prior to this dispute;a.The Respondent reclassified the Appellant’s Piaggio Ape three wheelers from Heading 8711 to 8703 and 8704 for the period November 2015 to October 2020 leading to a dispute.b.The Appellant challenged the Respondent’s classification at the Tribunal in TAT No. 83 of 2021 Car and General Trading Ltd V Commissioner of Customs and Border Control. The Tribunal’s decision was delivered on 15thOctober, 2021 where the Tribunal ruled that the Appellant’s product was classifiable under Heading 8711.c.The Respondent appealed the Tribunal’s decision in High Court on 16thDecember 2021 but subsequently withdrew the case and a Consent entered between the parties marking the case as closed on 18thApril 2023.d.The Appellant vide a letter to the Respondent dated 12thMay 2021 sought advance ruling on the applicable tariff for its imported Piaggio Appe three-wheeler product.e.The Respondent issued the Advance Ruling vide a letter dated 25thJune 2021 advising that the Appellant’s product was classifiable under Heading 8703. The Ruling was to be valid for one year.f.The Respondent following a post clearance audit issued the demand notice vide a letter dated 30thMarch 2023 for additional taxes in relations to the Appellant’s imported products relating to the period January 2022 to January 2023.g.The Appellant applied for review vide a letter dated 28thApril 2023 and the Respondent subsequently issued its review decision on 25thMay 2023 confirming the assessments. This review decision is the subject of this Appeal.86.It was the Appellant’s contention that given the uncertainty created by the Respondent's position and the potential costs that would have been incurred had the Tribunal found in favor of the Respondent in TAT Appeal No. 23 of 2021, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent on 12thMay, 2021 seeking a Ruling on the applicable tariff on the Appellant's product.87.That the Respondent being fully aware of the pending Appeal, issued the Advance Ruling on 25thJune 2021 which advised that the product was classifiable under HS Code 8703.21.1088.That in addition, the last paragraph of the Respondent's Ruling stated that it was valid for one (1) year from 25thJune 2021, which period extended into the audit period currently under assessment by the Respondent, that is January 2022 to January 2023.89.That the Advance Ruling provided clarity on the way forward, and it was on the basis of the same that the Appellant changed the classification of the product from Heading 8711 to Heading 8703 in order to align with the Respondent's position going forward.90.The Respondent on its part stated that the demand for taxes was made in compliance with the TAT Judgment delivered on 15thOctober 2021 upholding the Appellant’s classification of the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers (the Appellant's product) under Heading 8711.91.The Respondent stated that the current demand was based on the reclassification of the Appellant’s imports based on the decision in TAT No 23 of 2021 and was specifically for the period January 2022 to January 2023 and not based on the Auto Industries Judgment as advanced by the Appellant notwithstanding that the cases are similar and involve Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers. That in addition, the taxes being demanded substantially dropped from Ksh 1,194,383,014.00 to Ksh 224,693,908.00.92.On the issue of its Advance Ruling the Respondent stated that in its letter dated 25thJune 2021, it was informing the Appellant of the tariff classification of the Piaggio Ape Three Wheelers noting and as observed by the Tribunal in TAT No 83 of 2021.93.The Respondents stated that even if the letter dated 25thJune 2021 could be classified as an Advance Ruling, it did not comply with provisions of Section 248A EACCMA.94.The Tribunal notes that the dispute arose from the tariff classification used by the Appellant which was based on the Advance Ruling of the Respondent dated 25thJune 2021 wherein the Respondent classified the Appellant’s imported product under Heading 8703. The actual classification of the Appellant’s product which is not in dispute was settled by the Tribunal and the High Court, which ruled in both cases that the Appellant’s product was classifiable under Heading 8711.95.The Appellant had further argued on legitimate expectation raised by the Respondent’s Advance Ruling. It argued that it was not in doubt or a fact in issue that the Respondent is a public body, which has the power to make decisions that would affect the public, and to collect taxes in accordance with those decisions. That its actions, whether express or by conduct therefore, have the ability to create legitimate expectations based on its actions and conduct on the public. That based on the legitimate expectation, the Appellant proceeded to make immense investments on its products.96.The Respondent on its part stated that it was important to note that the matter was still under litigation during this period. That the Appellant failed to disclose this to the KRA during the application for the advance ruling. That the position held by the Commissioner in the Advance Ruling was however invalidated by the Tribunal’s determination on 15thOctober 2021 made at the instance and in favour of the Appellant.97.The Tribunal notes that the period covered by the tax demand in this dispute is January 2022 to January 2023 which was subsequent to the Tribunal’s Judgment delivered on 12thNovember 2021. The Tribunal’s Judgment ruled that the Appellant’s product was classifiable under Heading 8711. It therefore follows that in the absence of any other orders of a superior court, the subsisting law at the time was the Tribunal’s decision in TAT No. 83 of 2021 Car and General Trading Ltd V Commissioner of Customs and Border Control as delivered on 15thOctober, 2021 which stated as follows;“126.Based on the facts before it, the Tribunal pursuant to GIR 3(c) and GIR 4 found that Piaggio Ape three-wheeler vehicles imported by the Appellant did not meet the design characteristics of vehicles of heading 87 03 and 87 04 and were most appropriately classifiable under HS 87 11. “98.The Tribunal’s position is that the Appellant having received the Tribunal’s Judgment of 15thOctober, 2021 which ruled in its favour, the Appellant could not continue hanging onto the Respondent’s Advance Ruling issued on 25thJune 2021 in relation to taxes assessed for the period January 2022 to January 2023. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that in its application for Advance Ruling, the Appellant did not indicate that the application was meant to cover the period pending any Judgment or completion of litigation.99.The Tribunal therefore determined that the Respondent did not err in its demand for additional taxes from the Appellant for the period January 2022 to January 2023.Final Decision100.Based on the foregoing analysis the Tribunal finds that the Appeal lacks merit and the orders that accordingly recommend themselves are as follows;i.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.ii.The review decision dated 25thMay 2023 be and is hereby upheld.iii.Each party to bear its own costs.101.It is so orderedDATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA - CHAIRMANDR.

      [2024] KETAT 1248 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalTax Appeal E501 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, Cynthia B. Mayaka, RO Oluoch, T Vikiru & AK Kiprotich, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenSketchers Design Promoters LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Legal Services & Board CoordinationRespondentJudgmentBackground1.The Appellant is a private limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Kenya and engaged in the business of outdoor advertising, corporate branding, design, printing and advertising.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of the Kenya Revenue Authority Act, and the Authority is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.3.The Respondent issued additional assessment for VAT and Income tax to the Appellant on 18thand 26thApril, 2023 with a total principal tax liability of Kshs. 92,103,214.104.The Appellant objected to the assessments on 12thMay, 2023 on iTax.5.The Respondent issued an objection decision on 10thJuly, 2023 confirming the said assessments of all the principal tax, interest and penalties payable.6.The Appellant being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s decision lodged a Notice of Appeal dated and filed on 8thAugust, 2023.The Appeal7.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 22ndAugust, 2023 and filed on 24thAugust, 2023:a.That the VAT assessment for years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 was based on the variances between the Income tax and VAT returns for the period 2017 to 2021. However, the variances were relating to zero rated and exempt sales that should not be subjected to VAT. Hence the Commissioner erred by charging additional VAT taxes on the basis of the turnover variances that were exempt and zero-rated supplies.b.That the Commissioner did not consider all the documents provided by the Taxpayer to support the exempt supplies and zero-rated supplies due to the goods exported outside the Country.c.That further analysis of the data provided by KRA showed some computational errors that were included in the basis of tax computation as illustrated below:i.In regard to Year 2019, the Commissioner used a figure of Kshs. 140,975,330.00 as the Sales as per the VAT Returns instead of the correct figure of Kshs. 151,252,455.00 resulting in a wrong computational variance figure of Kshs. 54,075,481..00 instead of Kshs. 43,798,356.00 that accounted for Kshs. 10,277,125.00 error being subjected to additional tax assessment.ii.In regard to Year 2021, the Taxpayer had filed an original return on 29/06/2022 with an error which was corrected the same day vide an amended return to capture the correct turnover value as per the audited financial statements. That the Commissioner however, used the wrong sales turnover figure of Kshs. 177,534,533.00 that was captured in the original return instead of the corrected figure in the amended returns of Kshs. 157,534,533.00 hence resulting in a computational error of Kshs. 20,000,000.00 being subjected to tax.d.That the Commissioner charged additional VAT on the presumption that the taxpayer disposed some motor vehicles and did not bring them to charge of VAT. However, the taxpayer explained that the motor vehicles had not been disposed of as claimed; but had been written off the books of accounts due to their conditions of disrepair; and the documents from NTSA confirmed that no such disposal or transfer of ownership had taken place. Hence the additional VAT tax was charged in error.e.That the Commissioner erred in fact by insisting that the motor vehicles were disposed-off, hence subjected to VAT on disposal when in fact the motor vehicles still exist at the taxpayer's premises and are still registered in the taxpayer's name.f.That the Commissioner relied on the system variance between the Income Tax returns and VAT returns for the year 2020 to come up with a grossed-up sales from VAT3 returns without taking into account the expenditure incurred in realizing that income.g.That the Commissioner erred in charging Corporation tax without taking into account the expenditure exclusively incurred in generating the taxable income as provided for under Section 15(1) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 470).h.That the taxpayer provided the audited financial statements for year 2020 as requested by KRA and was not given any opportunity to substantiate any particulars that KRA was not satisfied with, hence it was prejudicial on the part of the Commissioner to presume that the expenses could not be supported by the taxpayer.i.That the Corporation tax variances charged in respect of year 2020 was due to the system input error which the taxpayer reported and applied to amend the returns, hence the variance should not be subject to tax.j.That the Commissioner raised additional taxes based on the variances between the employment costs as captured in the Income tax returns and PAYE returns for the period 2017 to 2021.k.That the variances were explained as being due to the casual wages that were not within the monthly PAYE returns but were expenses incurred wholly and exclusively to generate the taxable income hence the Commissioner erred by charging the same to additional corporation tax.l.That the Commissioner presumed that all the cash withdrawals were directors’ personal drawings and charged the same to PAYE; whereas the payments were made to company's petty cash system that was used to pay for the business expenses including the casual wages, the artisans, suppliers and other direct petty cash expenses.m.That the Commissioner was provided with all the required data and information how the cash withdrawn from the bank by the director was applied into the petty cash.n.That the Commissioner did not explain why he disregarded the explanation offered by the taxpayer in regard to the cash drawings from the bank into the petty cash.o.That the taxpayer objected to the assessment regarding WH-VAT since they did not receive any notice of the appointment as a withholding agent hence, they could not withhold the VAT on purchases.p.That notwithstanding the fact that the Taxpayer was not formally appointed as a withholding Agent, the withholding VAT is based on the actual payments made and not the arbitrary gross figure of purchases including creditors’ balances as was computed by the Commissioner.Appellant’s Case8.The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents:a.The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 22ndAugust, 2023 and filed on 24thAugust, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.The Appellant’s written submissions dated and filed on 20thFebruary, 2024.9.That the variances between the sales declared and inputs claimed in the VAT3 returns was due to the aggregated sales made in regard to the customers who had not presented their PINs to be captured by the taxpayer at the time of making the sales, hence the same was aggregated together as sales to non-registered customers.10.That however, the customers used the Sketchers Design Promoters Limited KRA PIN and claimed the inputs, hence the noted variances. That this has been reconciled and the Appellant attached the reconciliation to its pleadings.11.That to justify the reasons why the said amounts should not be subject to VAT, the Appellant had provided the following reasons for KRA to consider:a.Year 2018 - Kshs. 1,320,000.00 - The amount relates to the book value of motor vehicle, pickup Registration Number KCD 314T that was not disposed but instead written off due to mechanical breakdown and the wreckage is still at company premises as per the photos attached to the Appellant’s pleadings.b.Year 2020 - Kshs. 60,214.00 - The amount relates to the book value of motor cycle, pickup Registration Number KMEV 166E that was not disposed but instead written off due to mechanical breakdown and the wreckage is still at company premises as per the photos attached to the Appellant’s pleadings.c.Year 2021 – Kshs. 500,000.00 - The amount relates to the book value of motor vehicle van, Registration Number KBU 533K that was not disposed but instead written off due to mechanical breakdown and the wreckage is still at company premises as per the photos attached to the Appellant’s pleadings.12.The Appellant concluded that there is therefore no VAT on disposal as charged by the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes and the amount of additional VAT charged should be vacated.13.That in regard to Corporation tax, there was a system error at the time of filing the returns and the taxpayer has applied for technical support and assistance from KRA to enable it file the amended returns to reflect the correct position as per the audited financial statements. That the issue has been reported to the KRA support team for technical assistance.14.That the audited Financial Statements for year 2020 were attached for review to confirm that the Income Tax Turnover for Year 2020 was not nil, hence there was no additional tax.15.That in regard to disallowed telephone expenses for the years 2017 - 2019, the following computational errors were observed from the tabulation by the Commissioner in arriving at the additional assessment:-a.In regard to Year 2017, the Commissioner wrongly computed the total amount for the principal tax, penalty and interest as Kshs. 995,112.00 instead of Ksh.418,906.00 resulting in a variance of Kshs. 576,206.00 based on arithmetical errors.b.In regard to Year 2018, the Commissioner wrongly computed the total amount for the principal tax, penalty and interest as Kshs. 872,097.00 instead of Kshs. 367,121.00 resulting on a variance of Kshs. 504,976.00 based on arithmetical errors.c.In regard to Year 2019 the Commissioner wrongly computed the total amount for the principal tax, penalty and interest as Kshs. 608,875.00 instead of Kshs. 256,314.00 resulting in a variance of Kshs. 352,561.00 based on arithmetical errors.d.The interest charged was also not correctly computed in respect of the various years.16.That notwithstanding the issue of computational errors in the additional tax assessment based on the telephone expenses, the Appellant demonstrated that the expenses were incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes based on the reconciliation it attached to its pleadings.17.That the expenses related to airtime purchased for use in the office and for the sales team, including telephone accessories and internet maintenance service, hence the expenses should not be disallowed.18.That in relation to withholding VAT, the Appellant objected to the assessment since it did not receive any notice of the appointment as a withholding agent. That therefore, it could not withhold the VAT on purchases. That the Appellant was only notified of the appointment vide the email of 16thMarch, 2023.19.That the variances for PAYE were explained as being due to the casual wages that were not within Monthly PAYE payment bracket and were reconciled by the Appellant and the same was attached to its pleadings.20.That the casuals and artists were paid outside the payroll because of the temporary nature of the work and were only engaged on need basis by the company.21.That in regard to PAYE on bank drawings, the Commissioner assumed that all the cash withdrawals were directors' drawings and charged the same to tax; whereas the payments were made to company's petty cash system that was used to pay for the casual wages, the artisans, suppliers and other direct petty cash expenses.22.That the directors being the authorized signatories for the bank accounts are the ones who withdraw cash from the bank for petty cash usage. That hence the company expenses amounting to Kshs. 76,592,865.00 were charged in error as drawings on the directors. That a tabulation of the petty cash expenses was provided for review.23.That the taxpayer provided the requested documents through various volumes of files to support its objection to the tax decision made by KRA. That however, KRA did not review all the provided information to arrive at the correct tax decision based on the facts and the existing tax laws.24.That the Respondent claimed in the objection decision that the Appellant's objection application was rejected in full. That however, the Respondent went ahead and confirmed the principal tax liability amounts of less than the amounts in the tax assessment decision and objection notice.25.That the Tax Procedures Act Section 51 (8) states as follows:“Where a notice of objection has been validly lodged within time, the Commissioner shall consider the objection and decide either to allow the objection in whole or in part, or disallow it, and Commissioner's decision shall be referred to as an ""objection decision”26.That the Tax Procedures Act Section 51 (10) states:“An objection decision shall include a statement of findings on the material facts and the reasons for the decision”27.That however, the Respondent did not give statement of reasons for the tax heads omitted in the objection decision; that is the WHVAT and PAYE tax heads. That hence the only logical conclusion is that the same has been allowed in the objection decision. That this therefore means that the objection in regard to WHVAT principal taxes amounting to Kshs. 2,023,156.00 and PAYE principal taxes of Kshs. 22,977,860.00 in the initial assessment should be considered allowed.28.That the Respondent charged additional VAT taxes based on the turnover variances between the Income tax and VAT returns filed by the Applicant. That the VAT assessment for years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 was based on the variances between the Income tax and VAT returns for the period 2017 to 2021. That however, the variances were relating to zero rated and exempt sales that should not be subjected to VAT. That hence the Commissioner erred by charging additional VAT taxes on the basis of the turnover variances that were exempt and zero-rated supplies.29.That the Commissioner did not consider all the documents provided by the taxpayer to support the exempt supplies and zero-rated supplies due to the goods exported outside the country.30.That in regard to Year 2021, the taxpayer had filed an original return on 29thJune, 2022 with an error which was corrected on the same day vide an amended return to capture the correct turnover value as per the audited financial statements.31.That the Respondent however, used the wrong sales turnover figure of Kshs. 177,534,533.00 that was captured in the original return instead of the corrected figure in the amended returns of Kshs. 157,534,533.00 hence resulting in a computational input error of Ksh,20,000,000.00 being subjected to tax.32.That the Respondent did not give a statement of reasons why he refused the application as required by Section 49 of the Tax Procedures Act.33.That to restate the obvious, there must be an actual objective factual basis upon which an assessment of tax is based or as the Courts have put it in previous judgements, the tax authorities cannot just pluck figures out of the air and charge to tax. The Court of Appeal in Fleur Investments Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes & another [2018]eKLR pronounced itself on this.34.That in Republic vs. Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya ex parte Vipichandra Bhatt T/A J V Bhatt & Company Nairobi HCMA No. 285 of 2006, it was held that in the absence of a rational explanation, one must conclude that the decision challenged can only be termed irrational within the meaning of the Wednesbury unreasonableness, was in bad faith and constitutes a serious abuse of statutory power since no statute can ever allow anyone on whom it confers a power to exercise such power arbitrarily and capriciously or in bad faith.35.That the Appellant also relied on Republic vs Kenya Revenue Authority Ex parte Jaffer Mujtab Mohammed (2015) eKLR which held a similar view.36.That the Respondent had claimed in the objection decision that the Appellant did not provide all the requested documents, in particular the export entry sheets. That the Appellant and the Respondent had various meetings to discuss the issues raised in the submitted objection and the Respondent wrote various emails to the Appellant requesting for specific information and the Appellant provided the same. That on the issue of the export entries, it was mutually agreed that the customs data at the disposal of the Respondent be used to determine the correct amount of taxes due on the Appellant.37.That the requested information as per the email correspondences was provided as exhibited in the bundle of supporting documents provided with this Appeal.38.The Appellant submitted that despite being provided with documents and/or information, the Respondent did not provide it with the reasons for rejecting the evidence, whose validity was not and has never been questioned. That the Appellant draws the attention of the Tribunal to Section 49 of the Tax Procedures Act, which provides that:“Where the Commissioner has refused an application under a tax law, the notice of refusal shall include a statement of reasons.”39.The Appellant submitted that the right to be given reasons is part of the rights under the rules of natural justice, particularly that of fundamental fairness since it is a well-accepted principle that any decision made in violation of the principles of natural justice is a nullity and should be quashed on the application of the person affected.40.That the principle of fair administrative action is also enshrined under Article 47 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and as expressly enshrined in Section 4(3)(d) of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015 (""the FAA""), that states that it is the duty of public officers to give reasons for their actions as part of the due process of administrative rights guaranteed by law.41.The Appellant further submitted that without such reasons it is impossible to establish where the Respondent might have gone wrong and formulate one's grounds for challenge.42.The Appellant stated that although the current tax laws provide that the onus to prove that the assessment is wrong lies on the taxpayer, it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to put the taxpayer in a position where he would be required to produce any document that the taxman may require.43.That in demanding the production of documents which are not prescribed by legislation, the tax authority should be guided by reasonableness, the nature and circumstances of the trader otherwise it would, as it occasionally does, demand information which the trader cannot produce because he does not have and is under no obligation to have.44.The Appellant stated that this Honorable Tribunal, should in this case, apply the Cohan Rule birthed in the case of Cohan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,39 F.2d 540, 2U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) P 489, 8 A.F.T.R. (P-HI) P 10552 (C.C.A.2d Cir.1930) and accept reasonable explanations given by the taxpayer and evidence furnished by the Appellant45.That this position was held in Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada, 1997 Canlll 357(SCC),[1997]2 S.C.R. 336 at paragraphs 92 to 94.46.That Section 107 of the Evidence Act, Cap 80 of the laws of Kenya provides thus;“(1)Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.(2)When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.”47.That the Respondent herein did not discharge the above requirement of the Evidence Act to prove that there existed facts to show that the assets were disposed or sold.48.The Appellant concluded that having discharged its burden of proving its sales, purchases, exports and banking records, it is the Respondent's duty to demonstrate that the evidence so adduced was insufficient; and to prove the contrary and has failed to do so.49.That the Appellant relied on the matter of Shreeji Enterprises Limited-vs- Commissioner of 'Investigations and Enforcement, TAT Appeal No. 58 and 186 of 2019 in which the Tribunal observed as hereunder:“Although the current tax law provides that the onus of proof lies with the Appellant to prove that tax was paid or that the Respondent's assessment was wrong... In demanding the production of documents which are not prescribed by legislation, the tax authority should be guided by reasonableness, the nature and circumstances of the trader otherwise it would, as it occasionally does, demand information which the trader cannot produce because he does not have...”Appellant’s Prayers50.The Appellant prayed for orders that:a.The Tribunal be pleased to allow the Appeal in its entirety and set aside part of the objection decision by the Commissioner dated 10thJuly 2023 being assessment for principal Corporation taxes, VAT, PAYE, WHT including penalties and interests of Kshs. 186,300,636.00.b.The Tribunal be pleased to order the Respondent to pay the costs of this Appeal, andc.The Tribunal be pleased to issue any other orders favorable to the Appellant as it may find just and expedient to issue.Respondent’s Case51.The Respondent’s case is premised on the following documents:a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 18thSeptember, 2023 and filed on 21stSeptember, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.The Respondent’s written submissions dated 6thMarch, 2024 and filed on 11thMarch, 2024.52.That in order to ascertain the grounds of objection by the Appellant, the Respondent requested for the following documents: Current NTSA search results on all the three motor vehicles in contention, Customs entry sheets from the Appellant: bank statements clearly depicting receipt of payments for the invoices shared in the box file and Customs data.53.That the Respondent reviewed the above documents together with records held in iTax and observed the following;a.The Appellant provided audited accounts for the period under review in support of its incomes and expenditure. The audited accounts were examined and reviewed for correctness and seem to reflect the taxpayer's position.b.The Appellant did not provide a Customs entry sheet despite the Respondent’s request to demonstrate how the exported goods left the Country. The Customs data obtained did not match with the invoices provided by the Appellant.c.The disposable assets in contention were within the company premises and are scrapped off from books to avoid claiming wear and tear on them since they were not in usable condition.54.That subject to the above, the Respondent proceeded to confirm the additional assessments of principal tax of Kshs. 92,103,214.10 and further went on to issue an objection decision on 10thJuly, 2023 confirming the said assessments of all the principal tax, interest and penalties payable.55.That Section 24(2) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“The Commissioner shall not be bound by a tax return or information provided by, or on behalf of, a taxpayer and the Commissioner may assess a taxpayer's tax liability using any information available to the Commissioner.”56.That Section 31(1)(c) of TPA 2015 provides for amendment of assessments as follows:“(1)Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the “original assessment” by making alterations or additions, from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner’s judgement, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period to ensure that--(c)in any other case, the taxpayer is liable for the correct amount of tax payable in respect of the reporting period to which the original assessment relates.”57.That in response to grounds 1-3 of the Memorandum of Appeal, the Respondent averred that the Appellant did not provide Customs entry sheets despite being requested which would have demonstrated how the exported goods left the country. The Respondent averred that it noted that the invoices provided by the Appellant did not match the Customs data.58.That in response to grounds 4 and 5, the Appellant alleged that the assets in contention were not in usable condition and had been scrapped off the books to avoid claiming wear and tear; however they did not substantiate the same. The Respondent averred that the Appellant did not provide evidence that the said motor vehicles were no longer in use and therefore could not come to a different assessment.59.That Section 51(3)(c) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that an objection shall be deemed as validly lodged by a taxpayer if it is supported by all relevant documents.60.That Section 56(1) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”61.The Respondent averred that although the Appellant provided audited accounts for the periods under review, it did not provide ledgers, trial balances and primary documents to substantiate the expenses and proceeded to confirm the assessments.62.That the Appellant failed to provide relevant documents in support of its objection to the assessment and application for reprieve of the additional assessment. That therefore the Appellant failed to discharge its burden of proof.Respondent’s Prayers63.The Respondent prayed that this Tribunal:a.Dismiss the Appeal.b.Uphold the Respondent's objection decision dated 10thJuly. 2023.c.Award the Respondent the costs of the Appeal.Issues For Determination64.The Tribunal has considered the pleadings and documentation filed by both parties and is of the view that the singular issue for its determination is: Whether the Respondent’s assessments were justified.Analysis And Findings65.The Tribunal having established the issue falling for its determination, proceeds to analyse it as hereunder.66.The Appellant averred that the Respondent demanded documents that it had no obligation to keep under the law and that the Respondent did not consider the documents it provided, or the reasonable explanations, it gave consequently issuing an erroneous decision.67.The Respondent on its part argued that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof.68.The Tribunal has reviewed the parties’ documents and established that the Respondent issued a number of assessments on 17thApril, 2023; 18thApril 2023; 24thApril 2023 and 26thApril 2023 amounting to Kshs. 92,103,214.1069.The Tribunal notes that the assessments were issued on iTax and therefore the Respondent did not ask for any specific documents at the assessment stage. Further, the Tribunal notes, from the objection decision, that the Respondent stated that the Appellant did not provide NTSA searches to verify its claims on non-disposal of motor vehicles and that the Appellant provided audited accounts but did not provide ledgers, trial balances and primary documents to support its expenses. That therefore the Respondent was unable to verify the correctness of the audited accounts.70.The Tribunal further established that there were email correspondences between the parties on 17thMay, 2023, 18thMay, 2023, 19thMay, 2023, 29thMay, 2023 and 6thJune, 2023. These email correspondences related to documentation shared by the Appellant with the Respondent.71.The Tribunal thereafter notes that the Appellant’s objection claimed that it provided the following information and documents:a.In regard to the VAT assessment, a reconciliation of Income tax vs. returns turnover variances, a listing of computational errors occasioned by KRA in its calculation of additional VAT and Income tax as well as a listing of exempt and zero rated sales. It also provided support schedules to demonstrate the same.b.Further, to support its claims relating to the VAT assessment, a reconciliation of sales declared versus purchases claimed showing sales aggregated due to customers that had not presented their PINs to be captured by the Appellant.c.In relation to the assessment on disposal of motor vehicles, a breakdown of the motor vehicles written off by the company which in the Appellant’s explanation were written off due to mechanical wreckage and breakdown. The Appellant further attached photos to confirm that the vehicles were within its premises as well as logbooks showing that the motor vehicles in question were in the company’s name. The Appellant also attached a letter to NTSA requesting the Authority to confirm the information provided in the NTSA portal and certify ownership status of its motor vehicles.d.In regard to Income tax, it provided audited financial statements and explained that it had reported a KRA system error to the Respondent which estopped the Appellant from completing the process of amending its Income tax return. It stated that if the error was rectified, it would be able to file its amended return that would reflect the correct position. That the Respondent relied on the incorrect position in its computation of additional tax. The Appellant further provided a letter to KRA confirming that indeed it informed the Respondent of the system error as well as the amended return as lodged on iTax.e.A listing of computational errors made by the Commissioner in disallowing telephone expenses that the Appellant claimed were exclusively incurred for business purposes. That the telephone expenses were used in the office, for the sales team and internet maintenance. The Appellant provided a schedule showing the breakdown of the disallowed expenses apportioning them into the different expense lines.f.On withholding VAT, the Appellant stated that it had never been appointed as a Withholding tax agent. That it was only notified of an appointment on 16thMarch, 2023 and it attached email correspondence with the Respondent on the same.g.On Income tax employment costs vs PAYE returns, the Appellant provided the casual employee contracts to support its claims. The Appellant also provided the detailed artisans’ and casuals’ payment schedules.h.On PAYE on bank drawings, the Appellant explained that the directors’ accounts were used to withdraw cash for petty cash usage and the tabulation of usage of the petty cash was attached by the Appellant.72.The Tribunal thereafter analysed the itemised assessment as follows:a.        Value Added Tax based on Income Tax vs. VAT returns turnover variances73.The Tribunal confirmed that the Appellant provided a reconciliation of Income tax vs. returns turnover variances, a listing of computational errors occasioned by KRA in its calculation of additional VAT and Income tax, a listing of exempt and zero rated sales, LPOs and invoices to support the exempt sales, exempt sales bank statements and schedules which fully supported its claims in relation to this item as well as exported services invoices to support its zero rated sales.74.In regard to VAT, therefore, the Appellant fully supported its claims on exempted services and provided exported services invoices to support its zero rated sales. It however did not provide export entries to show that the branded goods it supplied exited the Country.75.Section 17(3) of the VAT Act provides as follows regarding documentation to support input tax claims:“The documentation for the purposes of subsection (2) shall be—(a)an original tax invoice issued for the supply or a certified copy;(b)a customs entry duly certified by the proper officer and a receipt for the        payment of tax;….”b.        Value Added Tax based on sales declared versus purchases claimed76.The Tribunal confirmed that the Appellant provided a schedule of VAT declared to KRA during the period under dispute. A perusal of the schedule provided however showed that it did not highlight/ break down the lumped up sales and did not reconcile the amounts queried by the Respondent in its assessment.77.In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Appellant did not discharge its obligation to fully support its claims for this item.c.        VAT on disposal of assets78.The Tribunal confirmed that the Appellant supported its claims by providing a breakdown of the motor vehicles written off by the company which were written off due to mechanical wreckage and breakdown, photos to confirm that the vehicles were within its premises, logbooks confirming that the motor vehicles in question were still in the Appellant’s possession and a letter to NTSA requesting the authority to confirm the information provided in the NTSA portal and certify ownership status of its motor vehicles.79.In this regard, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant supported its claims in relation to VAT on disposal of assets.d.        Income Tax80.The Tribunal has confirmed that the Appellant provided audited financial statements and the amended return that it lodged on the iTax website as well as the iTax acknowledgment receipt. It also provided a letter it submitted to the Respondent detailing the nature of the error in its initial return and the correction made in the amended return.81.However, while the Appellant provided its audited financial statements, it did not provide ledgers, trial balances and primary documents to support the same. In this regard, the Tribunal is of the position that the Appellant did not fully support its claims under Income tax.e.        Disallowed telephone expenses82.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant provided a schedule showing the various amounts incurred in airtime, accessories and maintenance. It however, did not adduce any further documents to support this schedule.83.In this regard, the Tribunal can not confirm the accuracy of the expenses supposedly incurred by the Appellant and to whom the various payments were made. Therefore, the Appellant did not fulfil its obligation to discharge its burden of proof as far as this expenditure is concerned.f.        Withholding VAT84.The Tribunal notes that while the Appellant claimed to have had correspondences with the Respondent in relation to this item, the Appellant stated that it was not informed of its appointment as a withholding VAT agent. It was only notified on 16thMarch, 2023. The Respondent did not disprove this assertion by the Appellant.85.Section 42A of the Tax Procedures Act provides as follows regarding appointment of Value Added Tax withholding agents:“1)The Commissioner may appoint a person to withhold two per cent of the taxable value on purchasing taxable supplies at the time of paying for the supplies and remit the same directly to the Commissioner.Provided that the withholding tax shall not apply to the taxable value of zero-rated supplies and registered manufacturers whose value of investment in the preceding three years from the commencement of this Act is at least three billion.”86.It is the Tribunal’s position that while the Respondent stated that it appointed the Appellant as a withholding VAT agent, the Appellant can only be aware of its agency once it is informed. To the extent that the Appellant stated that it was only made aware on 16thMarch, 2023, the Tribunal can only conclude that the effective date of this appointment was the date of notification.87.As a result of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the withholding VAT assessment was not justified.g.        Taxes relating to PAYE88.The Tribunal confirms that the Appellant adduced casual employment contracts as well as a schedule of bulk payments to support its claims that it paid casual workers who did not qualify for PAYE. Notably, the said contracts do not show the actual payments that were supposed to be made to the casual employees. The contracts simply stated that the compensation would be agreed at onset of the work or that the payments would be made every two weeks.89.In this regard, the Appellant did not dispel the Respondent’s assessment as the information it provided did not explain the amounts in variance as per the assessment. Notably, there was no evidence that the contracts were performed as payments made to casuals, artisans and towards other expenses were not provided as requested by the Respondent.90.In regard to payments of petty cash through directors’ accounts, the Appellant stated that it provided the tabulation of petty cash expenses for review. However, it did not attach any evidence to prove that it had provided the same to the Respondent nor provide the same for the Tribunal’s reference.91.The Tribunal, in view of the foregoing, finds that the Appellant partially discharged its burden of proof. The Tribunal finds that it supported its averments in relation to VAT on exempt sales, exported services and disposal of assets. It additionally supported its claims in relation to income tax relating to the error in its amended return of 29thJune 2022 that was corrected.92.On the other assessments raised by the Respondent, specifically in relation to exported goods, lumped up sales, disallowed telephone expenses and PAYE, the Appellant did not prove its case.93.Section 30 of the TAT Act provides as follows regarding burden of proof:“In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving—(a)where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment isexcessive; or(b)in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”94.Section 56 of the TPA also states as follows regarding burden of proof in tax appeals:“(1)In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”95.The fact that failure by the Appellant to discharge its burden of proof would result in the confirmation of the tax assessed against it was stated in the Kenya Revenue Authority v Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR where it was stated as follows:“The party that carries the burden of proof must produce evidence to meet a threshold or “standard” in order to prove their claim. If a party fails to meet their burden of proof, their claim will fail. “Burden of Proof” at the Tax Court is somewhat unique. At the Tax Court, a taxpayer is required to disprove an assessment by the Commissioner. In other words, a Taxpayer challenging a tax assessment will need to collect and present evidence in order to disprove the Commissioner’s position. This is the basic principle.”96.The Appellant in the instant Appeal failed to discharge its burden of proof to show that the Respondent erred in its assessments. It is for this reason that the Tribunal has arrived at the inevitable conclusion that the Appellant’s Appeal is partially supported.Final Decision97.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is partially merited. Consequently, the Tribunal proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby partially allowed.b.The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 8thJune, 2023 be and is hereby varied in the following terms:i.The assessment on VAT on exempt sales be and is hereby set aside.ii.The assessment on VAT on exported services be and is hereby set aside.iii.The assessment on VAT on disposal of assets be and is hereby set asideiv.The Withholding VAT assessment be and is hereby set aside.v.The income tax assessment relating to the error in returns be and is hereby set aside.vi.The VAT assessment on exported goods be and is hereby upheld.vii.The VAT assessment on lumped up sales be and is hereby upheldviii.The income tax assessment relating to disallowed telephone expenses be and is hereby upheldix.The assessment relating to PAYE be and is hereby upheld.x.The Respondent is hereby directed to recompute the tax assessment based on the Tribunal’s findings under Order (i) to (ix) above within Thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of this Judgment.c.Each Party to bear its own costs.98.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -  CHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

Mayaka, RO Oluoch, AK Kiprotich & T Vikiru, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenAwwal OilAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant is a limited liability company duly incorporated in Kenya and is a registered taxpayer.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed pursuant to Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act(KRA),Act No. 2 of 1995, and KRA is empowered to enforce and administer provisions of written laws set out in Section 5 as read together with the First Schedule of the KRA Act.3.The Respondent audited the Appellant's tax affairs for the period 2016 to 2020 and issued it with additional tax assessments of Kshs. 1,450,024,407.00 for Corporate income tax and Kshs. 1,075,293,588.00 for VAT on 28thJune 2022 and 29thJune 2022, respectively.4.The Appellant objected to the additional assessments via a letter dated 23rdMay 2023.5.The Respondent issued the Appellant with an Objection decision dated 21stJuly 2023 confirming the assessments.6.The Appellant, being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s Objection decision, lodged this Appeal at the Tribunal on 18thAugust 2023.The Appeal7.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal filed on 1stSeptember 2023 that:a.The Respondent erred in law and fact by ignoring Section 50 (1)(a) of theTax Procedures Act, which provides that an assessment or document under the hand of the Commissioner should be conclusive evidence that the particulars are correct.b.Having previously audited the exact same period and the arising liability settled by the Appellant, the Respondent erred in law and fact by violating the Appellant’s rights to fair administrative action by issuing a subsequent arbitrary assessment in the same manner, which act is unjust, malicious procedurally unfair and in bad faith.c.The Respondent erred in law and fact by violating the Appellant's right to legitimate expectation having issued a final decision on the tax liability status of the Appellant, which decision the Appellant had relied on to believe that the matter was closed; this act is unreasonable, irrational, unconstitutional, capricious and unprocedural.d.The Respondent erred in law and fact by ignoring the principle of certainty while dealing with the tax affairs of the Appellant.e.The Respondent erred in law and fact, by assuming that all credits in the Appellant's bank statements comprised of income of the Appellant, which should be subjected to tax contrary to Section 3 of theIncome Tax Actand Section 5 of theValue Added Tax Act.f.The Respondent erred in law and fact, by ignoring Section 29 of theTax Procedures Act, which places a limit of five years on the period the Respondent can go back to assess a taxpayer's affairs.g.The Respondent erred in law and fact, by failing to consider relevant support documents lodged by the Appellant in support of its objection.Appellant’s Case8.The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents before the Tribunal: -a.Its Statement of Facts dated 31stAugust 2023 and filed on 1stSeptember 2023.b.Its Written Submission dated 2ndApril 2024 and filed on 9thApril 2024.9.The Appellant averred that Section 50 (1) (a) of theTax Procedures Actprovides as follows on the conclusiveness of tax decisions:“1.Except in proceedings under this Part-(a)the production of a notice of an assessment or a document under the hand of the Commissioner shall be conclusive evidence of the making of the assessment and that the amount and particulars of the assessment are correct.”10.The Appellant submitted that the above provision explicitly states that the production of a notice of assessment or any document under the hand of the Commissioner shall be considered conclusive evidence of both the existence of the assessment and the accuracy of its particulars.11.The Appellant averred that the provision is aimed at providing definitive and binding authority to the decisions made by the Commissioner in the tax assessment process.12.The Appellant submitted that the sequence of events outline a series of assessments and objection decisions made by different departments of the Respondent's office.13.The Appellant averred that the critical question raised being whether these subsequent assessments, issued after an objection decision had been made, adhere to the statutory provision of conclusiveness under Section 50(1)(a) of theTax Procedures Act.14.The Appellant submitted that the objection decision dated 28thFebruary 2019, being a document under the hand of the Commissioner, is conclusive evidence that the North of Nairobi TSO assessed the Appellant and made a correct determination of the tax liability payable.15.Further, the Appellant contended that upon issuance of the objection decision dated 28thFebruary 2019, the Respondent pronounced itself on the matter of tax liabilities payable by the Appellant for the 2017 and 2018 transactions.16.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent demonstrated that a conclusive decision was reached and documented in the objection decision dated 28thFebruary 2019, which resulted in a tax liability that the Appellant committed to clear in installments.17.The Appellant averred that the Respondent, issuing a third subsequent assessment after the objection decision, is disregarding the finality of this settled matter. Further, the Appellant contended that the Respondent’s conduct not only violates the statutory provision of conclusiveness but also goes against the principles of administrative justice and certainty in tax law, which form the foundation of a fair and predictable tax system.18.The Appellant submitted that pursuant to Section 31 (1) of theTax Procedures Act, the Respondent may only amend the Original Assessment by making alterations or additions to the Original Assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period and not to issue totally new assessments for periods already assessed and the tax liabilities of a taxpayer determined.19.The Appellant submitted that Section 7 (2) of theFair Administrative Action Act2015 provides that:-“A court or tribunal under subsection (1) may review an administrative action or decision, if(b)a mandatory and material procedure or condition prescribed by an empowering provision was not complied with;(c)the action or decision was procedurally unfair:(h)the administrative action or decision was made in bad faith:(j)there was an abuse of discretion, unreasonable delay or failure to act in the discharge of a duty imposed under any written law;(k)the administrative action or decision is unreasonable:(m)the administrative action or decision violates the legitimate expectations of the person to whom it relates:(n)the administrative action or decision is unfair:(o)the administrative action or decision is taken or made in abuse of power”20.The Appellant averred that the principles of fair administrative action, as enshrined in Article 47 ofthe Constitutionand theFair Administrative Action Act, require public authorities to act fairly. reasonably, and in accordance with the law when making decisions that affect individuals' rights.21.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent's actions in issuing subsequent assessments for the same period and tax liabilities, despite an earlier objection decision in 2019, are indicative of unfair administrative action. The Appellant further averred that the Respondent's conduct in revisiting concluded tax matters without valid reasons or new evidence undermines the principles of fairness and procedural justice.22.The Appellant averred that the Respondent's action amounts to a breach of the Appellant’s right to fair administrative action for several reasons:i.The Respondent's failure to adhere to the conclusive nature of the objection decision dated 28thFebruary 2019 constitutes procedural unfairness. The objection decision, being a document under the hand of the Commissioner, should have been regarded as conclusive evidence of the correctness of the assessment particulars, as per Section 50(1)(a) of theTax Procedures Act. By issuing subsequent new assessments without substantial new evidence or exceptional circumstances and in complete disregard to Section 31 (1) of theTax Procedures Act, the Respondent failed to follow proper procedure, thus rendering its actions procedurally unfair.ii.The Respondent's conduct of issuing repeated assessments for the same tax liabilities, based on the same transactions and records, demonstrates bad faith. The Respondent's decision to issue new assessments after the objection decision had been made, without any indication of error or fraud in the earlier conclusions or amendments to the same, suggests a lack of good faith in their dealings with the taxpayer. This behavior not only undermines the trust between the taxpayer and the tax authority but also goes against the principles of fairness and transparency in administrative actions.iii.Additionally, the Appellant asserted that the Respondent's actions amount to an abuse of discretion. That the repeated attempts to assess the same tax periods, despite previous objection decisions, reflect an arbitrary exercise of power by the Respondent. That this abuse of discretion not only causes undue hardship to the taxpayer but also undermines the integrity of the tax assessment process.iv.That the absence of any indication in the Respondent's assessment or objection decision that the assessments subject to this Appeal are amended assessments further underscores the lack of transparency and procedural fairness in the Respondent's actions.23.The Appellant submitted that legitimate expectation arises when a body through its actions or declarations, leads an individual to anticipate a certain outcome, thus creating an assumption that the established procedure or benefit will be followed or conferred and in the realm of tax administration, the doctrine serves as a safeguard against arbitrary or capricious changes in policy, especially when a taxpayer has organized its affairs in reliance upon a tax authority's decision or established practice.24.The Appellant averred that it had every reason to hold the legitimate expectation that the tax assessment and liability, as resolved by the Respondent's conclusive decision dated 28thFebruary 2019, would be definitive. The Appellant submitted that the expectation was not a mere hopeful aspiration but was grounded in substantive interactions with the Respondent, including an extensive review and a formal objection decision process.25.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent, having audited the Appellant and having provided a conclusive tax liability amount, which the Appellant has partially settled, led the Appellant to organize its financial obligations around this settlement. That therefore, there existed a justifiable reliance on the Respondent's affirmation of the tax liabilities for the periods 2017 and 2018.26.The Appellant submitted that allowing a public authority to invalidate such expectations without a significant change in circumstances or without the due process of engaging the affected party, would render the concept of legitimate expectation illusory and our tax administration system arbitrary and unstable.27.The Appellant relied on the case of Noor Maalim Hussein & 4 Others vs. Minister of State for Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 & 2 Others [2012] eKLR where the court held that:-“if statutory power is exercised in a manner contrary to the drafters or against public interest, the power can be said to have been exercised capriciously, irrationally or unreasonably. Thus irrationality and unreasonableness would play a major role and we shall as courts continue to assert our traditional duty and intervene in situations where authorities like ministers and persons act in bad faith, abuse power, fail to take into account relevant considerations or act contrary to legitimate expectations.""28.The Appellant averred that the Respondent's exercise of statutory power has both overstepped the purpose for which such power is granted and infringed upon the Appellant's protected legitimate expectations. That where power is wielded in a manner that disregards previously established representations or deviates from consistent practices without adequate or legitimate reason and does not conform to the amendment provision in Section 31 of theTax Procedures Act, it stoops into the realm of unreasonableness.29.Further, the Appellant submitted that the Respondent's actions exhibit hallmarks of abuse, ranging from the retrospective assessment that seems punitive rather than corrective to the dismissal of legitimate taxpayer expectations without due regard for procedural fairness, thus an obdurate stance of the Respondent in disregarding these issues points towards an exercise of power that contradicts the very principles of objectivity and fairness that ought to govern all administrative actions.30.The Appellant averred that the question that thus presents itself before this Tribunal is not merely whether the Appellant has an obligation to pay taxes - an obligation which it does not dispute - but whether the exercise of power in demanding payment was made in fair adherence to principles of natural justice, due process, and without abuse of the power conferred by statute31.The Appellant submitted that Section 3(1) and 3 (2)(a)(i) of theIncome Tax Actprovides that:-“(1)Subject to, and in accordance with, this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.(2)Subject to this Act, income upon which tax is chargeable under this Act is income in respect of—(a)gains or profits from—(i)any business, for whatever period of time carried on”32.The Appellant submitted further that Section 5(1)(a) of the VAT Act provides that:-“(1)A tax, to be known as value added tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act on—(a)a taxable supply made by a registered person in Kenya”33.The Appellant averred that the law clearly specifies that income tax is based on the profits generated from business operations and not on general banking transactions and that VAT is based on taxable supplies made by registered persons in Kenya and not on general banking transactions.34.The Appellant submitted that the assessment of taxable income should be conducted with due diligence and in adherence to the principles enshrined in theIncome Tax Actand theValue Added Tax Act. The Appellant averred that reliance solely on bank statements without considering the nature and source of the credits therein represents a departure from these statutory requirements.35.The Appellant averred that during the audit and assessment by the North Nairobi TSO, it provided bank statements together with an analysis that indicated the account was used for purposes of making deposits towards financing the importation and also contained initial deposits from shareholders.36.The Appellant further submitted that it attached a listing of deposits with each deposit explanation in its Notice of Objection dated 23rdMay 2023 and therefore it was wrong for the Respondent to sum up those deposits together with the deposits in the Kenya Shillings account, as all comprising of company income.37.The Appellant averred that it provided the Respondent with actual sales invoices and bank statements to demonstrate its actual sales, and this is even admitted by the Respondent in paragraphs 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 of its Objection decision dated 21stJuly 2023, that therefore, the actual sales of the company, which amounted to Kes. 3,034,090,598 for the two years, could be easily discernible from the provided documentation.38.The Appellant averred that the examination of bank statements alone is insufficient to ascertain the nature of transactions and their tax implications accurately and that a comprehensive analysis, taking into account supporting documentation as provided by the Appellant, is necessary to provide a complete picture of the Appellant's financial activities and determine taxable income accurately.39.The Appellant submitted that subsections 23 (c) of theTax Procedures Actprovides that: -“(1)A person shall—(c)subject to subsection (3), retain the document for a period of five years from the end of the reporting period to which it relates or such shorter period as may be specified in a tax law”40.The Appellant submitted further that subsections 29 (1) (5) and (6), of theTax Procedures Actprovide that: -“(1)Where a taxpayer has failed to submit a tax return for a reporting period in accordance with the provisions of a tax law, the Commissioner may, based on such information as may be available and to the best of his or her judgement, make an assessment (referred to as a ""default assessment') of-(a)The amount of the deficit in the case of a deficit carried forward under theIncome Tax Act(Cap. 470) for the period;(b)The amount of the excess in the case of an excess of input tax carried forward under theValue Added Tax Act, 2013 (No. 35 of 2013), for the period; or(c)The tax (including a nil amount) payable by the taxpayer for the period in any other case(5)Subject to subsection (6), an assessment under subsection (1) shall not be made after five years immediately following the last date of the reporting period to which the assessment relates.(6)Subsection (5) shall not apply in the case of gross or willful neglect, evasion, or fraud by a taxpayer.”41.The Appellant averred that the Respondent’s assessment was made outside the statutory limitation period prescribed in Section 29(5) of theTax Procedures Act. The Appellant further submitted that the assessments were based on transactions from the period 2017-2018 and were issued in 2023, well beyond the five-year timeframe stipulated in the Act.42.The Appellant submitted that the Tribunal should closely scrutinize the burden of proof the Respondent carries in such allegations where there is a claim of fraud, willful neglect, or evasion by the Appellant. Further, the Appellant averred that an assertion of willful neglect or omission does not sufficiently stand on the mere issuance of an additional assessment without concrete evidence substantiating such claims.43.The Appellant averred that the Respondent's misapplication of Section 23(c) and Section 29 of theTax Procedures Actdemonstrates a lack of adherence to statutory provisions and fairness in tax assessments.44.The Appellant relied on the case of Keroche lndustries Limited V Kenya Revenue Authority & 5 Others [2007] eKLR, wherein the court pronounced itself as follows: -“it follows, therefore, that the tax demanded by letter of 29THNovember 2006 was not based on what was actually due in terms of figure, value, or volume. It was based on a formula other than what was actually produced, and to this extent, it was an illegal tax demand, and I find that it is a nullity. The same position prevails as regards VAT assessment on an input-output formulae because S 2, S 5 and 6 of the VAT Act, make it abundantly clear that tax is due when goods are supplied or delivered. They ought to have been based on actual sales, that is what was actually supplied or delivered. On the other hand, the letter of 23rdOctober shows that the assessment was based on an input-output ratio - and this is both outside the language and the relevant provisions of the Act the assessment is clearly ultra vires the Act and illegal small wonder, various assessments were made during the period 2001-2002 on the basis of the records availed. Another assessment was done between 2002 to 2004 on the basis of the availed records but records were said to have been unavailable in the year 2006. All the three audits come up with different figures over the same period. It is clear to the court that, in the entire decision-making process the Respondents have acted with incredible negligence. arbitrariness irrationality and in disregard of the applicable law and their powers. The irrationality and unreasonableness in the varying figures is quite evident. All these varying figures were made over the same period on the basis of the availed records. The same position prevails as regards the Income Tax assessment which was also based on expected sales instead of actual gains or profits. Moreover, the impugned decision as per the letter in question, represents an impropriety of procedure in making a composite demand that overlooked the procedural safeguards in each of the Acts. I find that the demands must fail on this ground as well.""45.The Appellant averred that the Respondent’s assessments are unlawful, arbitrary and contrary to statutory requirements for several reasons that:-i.The assessments were issued outside the statutory limitation period prescribed in Section 29(5) of theTax Procedures Act, exceeding the five­ year timeframe from the last date of the reporting period to which the assessment relate. That the Respondent failed to demonstrate gross neglect, evasion. or fraud by the Appellant to warrant the application of the exception under subsection 29(6).ii.The total sales assessed were based solely on bank statements without due consideration of the nature and source of the credits therein. This approach disregards the statutory framework outlined in theIncome Tax Actand theValue Added Tax Act, which emphasize the taxation of gains or profits from business activities and taxable supplies, respectively.iii.The assessments were issued despite earlier objection decisions in 2019, which created a legitimate expectation that the tax matters for the period in question were settled. Revisiting concluded tax matters without valid reasons or new evidence undermines the principles of finality and conclusiveness articulated in Section 50(1)(a) of theTax Procedures Act.iv.The assessments were conducted without providing any explanation or justification for departing from earlier decisions and disregarding procedural fairness and legitimate expectations. That the Fair administrative action requires public authorities to act transparently, reasonably, and in accordance with the law when making decisions that affect individuals' rights.46.The Appellant submitted that all the three audits came up with different figures over the same period. Further, the Appellant averred that the Respondent acted with incredible negligence during the entire decision-making process, arbitrariness, irrationality, and disregard for the applicable law and its powers and that all these varying figures were made over the same period on the basis of the availed records.47.The Appellant averred that the turnover comparative analysis by the Respondent indicated the sale difference of Kshs. 1,653,872,579 between IT2C and VAT3 in 2018 which was incorrect as the correct value was Kshs. 1,678,118,853 a figure similar to the determination made in the prior audit of 2018.48.The Appellant submitted that the difference was due to the July 2018 sale, which could not be declared due to additional assessments KRA201809781831, which resulted in the depletion of the entire credit the Appellant is claiming.Appellant’s Prayers49.The Appellant prayed the Tribunal that:-a.The Appeal be allowed with costs to the Appellant;b.The decision of the Respondent dated 21stJuly 2023 be vacated and set aside in its entirety; andc.Any other orders that the Tribunal may deem fit.Respondent’s Case50.The Respondent’s case is premised on the hereunder filed documents:-a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated and filed on 4thOctober 2023.b.The Respondent’s Written Submissions dated and filed on 19thMarch 2024.51.The Respondent averred that it is not bound by the returns filed and/or information provided by the Appellant at the time of filing the returns. It relied on Section 24 (2) of the Tax Procedure Act which provides that;''The Commissioner shall not be bound by a tax return or information provided by, or on behalf of, a taxpayer and the Commissioner may assess a taxpayer's tax liability using any information available to the Commissioner.""52.The Respondent averred that it carried out a tax audit on the Appellant for the period 2016 to 2020 and established that there were variances between the Income tax return and the VAT return and between imports declared and those actually imported. That in addition, there were bank credits that had not been declared for tax purposes.53.The Respondent submitted that it wrote to the Appellant requesting for explanations, information, and documents. That the Appellant provided documents that could not adequately determine whether or not the variances and/or the bank credits had been charged to tax.54.The Respondent submitted that it invited the Appellant to meetings to establish its tax liability, however the Appellant failed to honor the invites.55.The Appellant submitted that Section 3(1) and 3 (2)(a)(i) of the Income Tax provides that:-“22.Subject to, and in accordance with, this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.”56.The Respondent further submitted that Section 5(1)(a) of the VAT Act provides that:-“(1)(1) A tax, to be known as value added tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act on—(a)a taxable supply made by a registered person in Kenya;(b)the importation of taxable goods; and(c)a supply of imported taxable services.”57.The Respondent averred that it treated the variances and credits as income that was accrued and/or derived from Kenya and, therefore, chargeable to tax and charged the income and variances to tax.58.The Respondent submitted that Section 31 (1) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the ""original assessment"") by making alterations or additions, from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner's judgement, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period to ensure that-……………….……………….c.In any other case, the taxpayer is liable for the correct amount of tax payable in respect of the reporting period to which the original assessment relates.""59.The Respondent averred that the aforementioned Section empowers it to make alterations or additions to an original assessment using the available information and based on the Respondent's best judgment to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid.60.The Respondent averred that it is allowed to make additional assessments within five (5) years using the available information and beyond five (5) years in cases of fraud, gross or wilful neglect, or evasions and further, that where new information becomes available to the Respondent it can carry out an audit and issue an additional assessment.61.The Respondent submitted that Section 29 (5) and (6) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“5.Subject to subsection (6), an assessment under subsection (1) shall not be made after five years immediately following the last date of the reporting period to which the assessment relates.6.Subsection (5) shall not apply in the case of gross or wilful neglect, evasion or fraud by a taxpayer.""62.The Respondent further submitted that Section 31 (4) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“The Commissioner may amend an assessment-a.in the case of gross or wilful neglect, evasion, or fraud by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer, at any time;b.in any other case, within five years ofi.for a self-assessment, the date that the self-assessment taxpayer submitted the self-assessment return to which the self-assessment relates; orii.for any other assessment, the date the Commissioner notified the taxpayer of the assessment.""63.The Respondent submitted that it is mandated to issue default and additional assessments within five (5) years, therefore, an assessment dated and issued on 31stDecember 2021 covers taxes for the periods 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016.64.The Respondent averred that the issued additional assessments for the periods 2017 and 2020 vide a letter dated 31stDecember 2021 were taxes assessed and demanded for the periods 2017 and 2020 and were therefore demanded within the statutory timelines.65.The Respondent relied on the case of R v Turbill and Broadway [2014], the England Wales Court of Appeal which defined the term willfully as:“willfully"" means deliberately refraining from acting or refraining from acting because of not caring whether the action was required or not.”66.The Respondent further relied on The Black's law dictionary, 2nd edition definition of neglect as;“Omission; failure to do something that one is bound to do; carelessness.""67.Therefore, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant willfully neglected and/or omitted to declare part of the income earned because it had the obligation to declare all the income earned during and for the period under taxation.68.The Respondent relied on the case of Golden Cara Investments Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes wherein the Tribunal held that;“The Tribunal having concluded in issue (b) that the Appellant had omitted to include the turnover as alleged by the Respondent, finds that the Appellant knowingly omitted in its tax returns which should have been included committed. The Respondent was therefore justified in assessing the Appellant for the period beyond 5 years.""69.The Respondent submitted that Section 56 (1) of the Tax Procedure Act provides that;“In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.""70.The Respondent relied on the case of Commissioner of Investigation and Enforcement v Pearl Industries Limited [2022] eKLR held that;“Under section 56 of the TPA, it was incumbent upon the Respondent to prove that the Commissioner's findings above were wrong. How could it do so? By providing evidence and supporting documentation to dislodge the Commissioner's findings.""71.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant can only discharge the burden of proof by providing relevant and competent documents.72.The Respondent further relied on the case of Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement v Evans Odhiambo Kidero (2022) eKLR where the Court stated as follows on the burden of proof;“The issue in this appeal is whether and to what extent the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that the money it received was campaign contribution. In line with section 56(1) of the TPA, the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that assessment made by the Commissioner is incorrect. This also fits in with the principles of the law of evidence that he who asserts must prove encapsulated in sections 107 of theEvidence Actwhich provides, inter alia, that whoever desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right dependent on the existence of facts which he assets, must prove those facts exist.To discharge the burden of proof, the Respondent need to not only prove that the impugned amount was indeed campaign funds as declared but also that the money was expended for political campaign purposes.""73.The Respondent posited that the burden is upon the Appellant to prove that the assessment was unjust, malicious, in bad faith, and procedurally unfair and that some of the credits were not income chargeable to tax.74.The Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to provide documents in support of its objection and allegations advanced even after several requests and failed to discharge the burden of proof as required in theIncome Tax Actand Tax Procedure Act.75.The Respondent averred that a legitimate expectation can only be created and operate within the confines of the law, then only can it be legitimate. The Respondent relied on the holding of the Court of Appeal in the case of Kenya Revenue Authority & another v Republic (Ex parte) Kenya Nut Company Limited [2020] eKLR when it stated as follows;“It has long been established that legitimate expectation can only operate within the law and it can only be relied on when the law has been complied with.""76.Further, the Respondent relied on the holding of the Supreme Court in the case of Communications Commission of Kenya & 5 others V Royal Media Services Limited & 5 others (2014) eKLR, where the court considered the principle of legitimate expectation that stated that;''No doubt these are clear .and uncontroverted statements of promise from a Government representative, the Permanent Secretary. To constitute a promise into a signal capable of giving rise to a right founded on legitimate expectation, it must be demonstrated that the Permanent Secretary had the lawful capacity to make such representations to the 1st and 2nd Respondents or to their consortium. It falls to this Court to consider whether such representations were predicated upon the relevant law.’’77.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to declare the correct amount of income and pay the correct amount of taxes, thus creating a legitimate expectation not to charge income to tax and/or pay the correct amount of taxes would be against the law and the very spirit of legitimate expectation.Respondent’s Prayers78.The Respondent prayed that this Tribunal:-i.Dismiss the Appeal with costs for lack of merit.ii.Uphold the assessments and the Objection decision dated 21stJuly 2023.Issues for Determination79.The Tribunal having considered the pleadings and submissions of both parties is of the considered view that the issues that call for determination are:a.Whether the Respondent’s assessments were in contravention of the provisions of Section 29(5) of the TPA.b.Whether the Respondent was justified in confirming the additional assessments.Analysis And Determination80.The Tribunal having identified the issues falling for its determination proceeds to analyze the same as hereunder.a. Whether the Respondent’s assessments were in contravention of the provisions of Section 29(5) of the TPA.81.The Appellant contended that the Respondent’s assessments were based on transactions from the period 2017-2018 and were issued in 2023, well beyond the five-year timeframe stipulated in the Act.82.Section 29(5) and (6) of theTax Procedures Actprovides as follows regarding time limitation for tax assessment;“(5)Subject to subsection (6), an assessment under subsection (1) shall not be made after five years immediately following the last date of the reporting period to which the assessment relates.(6)Subsection (5) shall not apply in the case of gross or wilful neglect, evasion or fraud by a taxpayer.”83.Whereas the Appellant contended that the assessments were received in 2023, the Tribunal in its analysis of documents tabled by both parties did not sight the alleged assessments issued in 2023.84.The Respondent stated that it issued assessments via i-tax on 28thJune 2022, although neither party attached a copy of the said assessment, the Appellant in its pleadings confirmed receiving assessments through i-tax on 28thand 20thJune 2022.85.To determine whether the Respondent’s assessments contravened Section 29(5) of the TPA, the Tribunal undertook a cursory count of five years from the date of assessment and established that:a.VATVAT returns being monthly returns, the last date of the reporting period to which the assessment related was 20thJune 2017, hence VAT assessments for periods prior to May 2017 was out of the five year period.b.Income TaxThe last date of reporting for Income tax for year 2017 was June 2018 hence the Respondent’s assessments on 29thJune 2022 was within the five year limit.86.The Tribunal therefore finds that save for the Respondent’s VAT assessments for periods prior to May 2017 which contravened Section 29(5) of the TPA, the VAT assessments from May 2017 to 2020 and the income tax assessments for the years 2017 to 2020 were within the five year limit.b.  Whether the Respondent was justified in confirming the additional assessments.87.Having determined that VAT from May 2017 to 2020 and income tax assessments for 2017 and 2020 were within the five year limit, the Tribunal shifted its focus to determining whether the Respondent’s confirmation of the assessments was justified.88.To dispense of with this issue of determination the Tribunal analysed it under the two subheadings below:-i. Whether the impugned assessment related to tax heads, periods and transactions already assessed and settled.89.It was the Appellant’s contention that the tax assessments in question related to taxes that had been settled via earlier assessments. That the Respondent had in two earlier assessments targeted the Appellant using different departments to issue assessments upon the Appellant for the same taxes, covering the same periods and transactions hence the Respondent had gone against the import of Section 50(1) of the TPA on conclusiveness of the Respondent’s assessment as well as against the Appellant’s legitimate expectation of certainty in tax administration.90.The Tribunal analysed the Appellant’s submissions and the documents it attached to support its claim that the taxes being demanded by the Respondent had been settled via a previous assessment, objection decision and payments it had made in that regard.91.The Tribunal found that as per the attached correspondence, the tax earlier assessed and settled via the objection decision of 28thFebruary 2019 was VAT for the period May 2018 whose evidence of partial payment the Appellant attached.92.The assessment and objection decision in the instant Appeal cover a wider period being the entire years of income 2017 and 2018. The Tribunal observed that the Respondent in conducting a fresh audit and subsequently assessing VAT for the entire year 2018 without indicating that it had excluded VAT for May 2018 occasioned double taxation of the Appellant for the period May 2018.93.The Tribunal therefore finds that VAT for the period May 2018 having been earlier settled should be excluded from the current assessment.ii. Burden of Proof94.Having found that VAT, Income tax and WHT for years 2017 & 2018 had not been assessed previously save for VAT for May 2018, the Tribunal proceeded to determine whether the Appellant had discharged its burden of proof to disproof the Respondent’s assessments.95.It is trite law that the burden of proof in tax disputes rests with the Appellant to disprove the Commissioner’s assessments. Sections 56(1) of the TPA and 30 of the TAT Act are an unequivocal that a taxpayer has the duty to show that the Respondent’s assessments are erroneous or inaccurate. The Sections state:Section 56(1) of the TPA: -“In any proceedings under this part, the burden of shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”Section 30 of the TAT Act:“In any proceeding before the Tribunal the Appellant has the burden of proving where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; or in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”96.The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred by assuming that all credits in the Appellant’s bank statements comprised of income of the Appellant which should be charged contrary to Section 3 of the ITA and Section 5 of the VAT Act.97.The Appellant propounded that the Respondent erred by failing to consider relevant supporting documents lodged by the Appellant in support of its objection.98.The Appellant had an evidential burden to discharge in demonstrating that the Respondent disregarded any material documents and information made available to it thereby arriving at an inaccurate assessment of the Appellant’s tax liability.99.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant did not attach evidence to show that it indeed provided the said documents to the Respondent for consideration, the Tribunal further noted that the Appellant did not provide the said documents at the Appeal stage to discharge its burden to proof at the Tribunal as provided for in Section 30 of the TAT Act.100.The Tribunal has held in numerous decisions that the burden of proof in tax disputes rests with the Appellant, the same can only shift to the Respondent once the Appellant adduces evidence which the Respondent will then be required to demolish so as to sustain its case. The Tribunal reiterates its position in the case of TAT Appeal No. 537 of 2019 Mugo Macharia Kigo Vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes where it held as follows;“52.The Tribunal equally notes that the Appellant failed to specifically address the identified variances between the disclosed sources of income and the bank deposits as highlighted in the Objection Decision during the proceedings for the determination of the Appeal before the Tribunal but rather opted to generally challenge the Respondent’s use and application of the bank deposit analysis test in its situation.53.The Tribunal finds that the Appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof placed upon it in demonstrating that the Respondent’s use and application of the bank deposit analysis yielded in an unfair and unreasonable tax assessment based on the documents made available by the Appellant both at the objection and appeal processes. There is no evidence adduced on the part of the Appellant to demonstrate that the tax assessment was incorrect and/or excessive. The Respondent’s use of officers from a different branch to carry out investigation was entirely an administrative decision within its exclusive prerogative and no discernible procedural prejudice was thereby occasioned to the Appellant in the manner the investigation was carried out and the tax assessment made and confirmed.”101.The Appellant having failed to discharged its burden of proof, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was justified in confirming the additional assessments except for those excluded under the determination in (i) above.Final Decision102.In view of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal finds that the Appeal is partially merited and accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby partially allowed.b.The objection decision dated 21stJuly 2023 be and is hereby varied in the following terms:i.The Respondent to recompute the assessment to exclude VAT for periods prior to May 2017.ii.The Respondent to recompute the assessment to exclude VAT for the period May 2018 already settled in accordance with the Respondent’s objection decision dated 28thFebruary 2019.iii.The VAT assessments from May, 2017 to 2020 (Save for May, 2018) are hereby confirmed.iv.The Income tax assessments for the years 2017 to 2020 are hereby confirmed.c.Each party to bear its own costs.103.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9TH DAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

      [2024] KECA 1128 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Court of Appeal at NyeriCriminal Appeal 68 of 2019W Karanja, J Mohammed & LK Kimaru, JJASeptember 6, 2024In the matter ofJackson KaberiaAppellant(Being an Appeal from the Judgement of the High Court of Kenya at Meru (F.M. Gikonyo, J.) dated 20th February, 2018 in HCRA No. 62 of 2017)Judgment1.Jackson Kaberia (Jackson), (the appellant) was charged before the Tigania Principal Magistrate’s Court with the offence of robbery with violence contrary to Section 296(2) of the Penal Code. It was alleged that on the night of 3rdJanuary 2015 at (Particulars withheld) Village in Tigania East District within Meru County, jointly with others not before court while armed with dangerous weapons namely riffles and Somali swords they robbed SKK (Sarah) (the complainant) of one mobile phone make Nokia 1680 valued at Kshs.8,000 and Kshs.6,900 all valued at Kshs.14,900 and immediately before the time of such robbery assaulted the said SKK. He was also charged with gang rape contrary to Section 10 of theSexual Offences Act.2.The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges and the matter proceeded for hearing with four witnesses testifying in support of the prosecution case. When placed on his defence, the appellant gave an unsworn statement and called no witnesses. The trial magistrate upon considering the evidence before the court, found the appellant guilty, convicted him, and sentenced him to death on the count of robbery with violence while on count two, he was convicted of the lesser offence of committing an indecent act with an adult and sentenced to five (5) years imprisonment with hard labour.3.Being aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the High Court. Upon re-evaluating the evidence, the High Court (Gikonyo, J.) upheld the appellant’s conviction and sentence and dismissed the appeal. However, the sentence with regard to count 2 was held in abeyance. Being further aggrieved, the appellant moved to this Court on second appeal against both conviction and sentence.4.In his home made memorandum of appeal, the appellant faulted the learned Judge for, inter alia, failing to discharge his duty of re- considering, re-evaluating and analyzing the evidence before the trial court and come to its own conclusion; for failing to note that section 204, 296(2) is unconstitutional; for failing to note that the circumstances were not favourable for positive identification; for    failing to note that the evidence adduced by the complainant was    not proved beyond reasonable doubt and that the sentence was harsh and excessive in the circumstances.5.The appellant’s counsel later filed a supplementary memorandum of appeal in which he faulted the High Court for failing to discharge its duty of re-considering, re-evaluating and analysing the evidence before the trial court; for failing to give the appellant a chance to mitigate; for failing to warn himself on the risky reliance of a visual identification of an eye witness whose evidence was contradictory and inconsistent hence raising doubt on the credibility and that the sentences were harsh and excessive in the circumstances.6.Briefly, the prosecution case was that on the night of 3rdJanuary 2015 at around 7:30pm, the complainant was going home from her place of work. It had rained at the time. When she got to her compound, she saw three people approach her, one armed with a rifle, one with a knife and that the third person was all covered up. She stated that two of the persons were visible as they were uncovered.7.She testified that the intruders grabbed her and pushed her into her house where her two children aged nine and four respectively were present. She stated that the man with the rifle pushed her into the house and that the appellant stepped on her head and    demanded for money. Further, that the thugs forced the children    under the bed in one of the bedrooms as the thugs were harassing her in the sitting room. She stated that the assailants beat her up demanding for money. They ransacked the whole house but failed to get any money whereupon the gunman held her at gunpoint and threatened to kill her if she did not give them money.8.She testified that at some point the assailants pushed her into the second bedroom and that the appellant removed her clothes and placed his penis in her vagina and when about to penetrate her, the assailant with the gun shoved him aside and proceeded to rape her. She stated that later they covered her face with a sack and left her naked, a state in which she was later found by her children.9.That before that the assailants had demanded that she transfers money from her cell phone No.0720-998xxx to their cell phone No.0714-661xxx which she later learnt was registered in the name of Rosiea John. She stated that she transferred Kshs.6,900 under duress to the said number and that after the transfer the assailants took her cell phone make Nokia 1680 which had been given to her as a present by her brother Justus Mwongela.10.She stated that finally she was found by her husband who took her to Muthara Police Station where she was issued with a P3 form which she took to Tigania Hospital where she was examined and    treated. The matter was reported to the police station and    investigations commenced. From the medical examination, the complainant was found to have been assaulted as a result of which she sustained injuries on her shoulder and lower back. On examination, there were no bruises and lacerations in the vagina and cervix but there was presence of seminal fluid on the outer genitals. A high vaginal swab revealed spermatozoa and epithelial cells indicating sexual intercourse. The injury was classified as harm.11.The appellant was arrested later following a tipoff that he had been sighted selling a cell phone. He was arrested by PC Mutuku within Muthara Market. An identification parade was carried out on 28thJanuary, 2015 at 2.30 p.m. and the appellant was positively identified as the person who had robbed and raped the complainant. He was subsequently charged with the charges earlier outlined.12.In his defence, the appellant denied committing the offence, and explained that he did not know Sarah and had never seen her before.13.In support of the appeal, the appellant’s counsel filed submissions dated 11thDecember, 2023. It was submitted on the issue of whether there was positive identification of the appellant that the complainant while giving her testimony in court stated that she    was able to see the faces of two of her attackers out of the three    because their faces where not covered. That she was able to positively identify the appellant because there was electricity in the house where the alleged crime took place and because the whole event took about an hour during which time, she could see the appellant. It was submitted, however, that she did not state that during this time she could see the appellant clearly to be able to identify him later.14.It was submitted that the identification parade was conducted a month later and that even before the identification parade was conducted the complainant did not give any description of the two assailants.15.Counsel submitted that it is important to note that the complainant did not give any description of the assailants to the police when she first reported the matter. Further, it was submitted that this issue was raised by learned counsel Thibaru during the 1stappeal where she stated that the complainant did not give the description in the initial report for proper and positive identification of the appellant.16.It was submitted that the learned Judge did not deal with the description issue which was raised by the appellant’s advocate and only focused on the issue of identification of the appellant by a single witness. Counsel further submitted that an identification    parade is only used to affirm the ability of the complainant to    identify the assailants who she/he described to the police when the crime was reported and that in this case the complainant did not give any description of the assailant when she reported the case to the police nor before the identification parade nor did she indicate the aspect of the appellant’s appearance that made her pick the appellant in this case.17.It was submitted that without the description of the assailant it is unclear how the complainant was able to identify the appellant. Counsel thus submitted that in light of the foregoing it is clear that the learned Judge did not consider the identification evidence well because if he had done so the appellant would have been set free.18.With regards to the failure by the appellant to mitigate before sentence it was submitted that the record shows that the appellant may not even have understood what mitigation was. It was submitted that the court did not explain to him what mitigation was and when he was called to mitigate, the appellant responded as follows:-“I was framed and I have nothing else to say.”It was submitted that this clearly implies that the appellant did not understand what mitigation was and the trial court did not bother to explain that to him.19.On the defence that was raised by the appellant, it was argued that the same was never rebutted by the prosecution. We were urged to allow the appeal. Mr. Wakahu, learned counsel for the appellant, adopted these submissions and laid emphasis on the issue of identification, stressing that the issue on insufficiency of positive identification was enough to earn the appellant his freedom.20.For the respondent, Ms. Nandwa learned prosecution counsel opposed the appeal. In submissions dated 7thDecember, 2023 it was submitted that the ingredients of the offence of which the appellant was charged were proved to the required standard of proof. On the issue of identification Ms. Nandwa submitted that in carrying out the identification parade, Sarah was able to identify the appellant as one of her assailants and that this evidence was never challenged during trial.21.With regards to gang rape, Ms. Nandwa submitted that the offence was proved to the required standard of proof and that the results from the government analyst indicated that the samples were from an indeterminate origin ostensibly on account of more than a single assailant and hence that the same was enough evidence by the prosecution to prove that Sarah was raped by more than one person.22.On sentence it was submitted that the death sentence meted by the trial court was the legal sentence and was well within the law, we were urged to dismiss the appeal on conviction and sentence.23.This being a second appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court as specified under Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is limited to matters of law only. As stated by this Court in Chamagong -vs- Republic (1984) KLR 611:-“A court on appeal will not normally interfere with a finding of fact by the trial Court whether in a Civil or Criminal case unless it is based on no evidence or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the Judge is shown demonstrably to have acted in wrong principles in reaching the findings he did.”24.We have considered the record of appeal, the rival oral and written submissions, and the law, bearing in mind our jurisdiction as aforestated. In our view, this appeal succeeds or falls on one ground only, namely, identification. Was the identification of the appellant by Sarah sufficient to support a conviction?25.As appreciated by the two courts below, Sarah was the only eye witness to the robbery. She testified that she identified the appellant at the scene of crime as the incident took about one hour and the room was lit by electricity making it bright enough for her to identify the appellant.26.It is not disputed that the law requires that the evidence of a single witness be treated with the greatest circumspection before the    same can be relied upon to support a conviction. See Roria  -vs-    Republic [1967]EA 573. The position has subsequently been    reiterated in many decisions of this Court, including Cleophas    Otieno Wamunga -vs- R. [1989]eKLR. See also R. -vs- Turnbull    [1976] 3 ALL ER 549. In this case, the trial magistrate did indicate in his judgment that he was aware of the danger inherent in basing a conviction on the evidence of a single witness before going ahead to convict the appellant.27.It is apposite to note that the trial court relied on the evidence on the direct identification of the appellant by the complainant and also on the identification parade which was conducted about a month later, whereby the complainant is said to have picked out the appellant. This evidence was challenged before the High Court on appeal. The learned Judge found that the incident had taken a considerable period of time and the complainant had ample time to identify the appellant. The learned Judge went on to find that the trial magistrate had cautioned himself of the danger of convicting on the basis of the evidence of a single witness.28.Having done so, the learned Judge found that the identification of the appellant was watertight and on the basis of identification alone proceeded to uphold the conviction.29.The issue we have to address now is whether the evidence of identification as adduced before the trial court and accepted by    the High Court was sufficient to support conviction against the appellant. We note that the complainant had never seen or known the appellant before the date in question. It is possible that in the one hour taken to commit the offence, the complainant was able to see the appellant clearly. If so, she would have given a description of her assailant to the police when the report was first made, or even describe him in her statement to the police.30.This would have been necessary to aid the police in identifying and arresting the suspect. (See Peter Mwangi Mungai -vs-   Republic [2002] eKLR). In this case the circumstances under    which the appellant was arrested were not clear, but what is evident is that the arrest was not as a result of his description to the police by the complainant. We also note that the identification parade was conducted almost a month after the robbery. It is possible that the complainant’s memory may have faltered. These were issues that were raised by learned counsel for the appellant before the High Court but they were not considered. We find the complainant’s lone evidence of identification of the appellant in the absence of any other evidence insufficient to support the conviction. The appellant should have been given the benefit of the doubt in the circumstances and acquitted.31.Accordingly, we find this appeal has merit. We allow the appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. The appellant shall be set at liberty forthwith unless otherwise lawfully held.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W.

      [2024] KECA 1125 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Court of Appeal at NyeriCriminal Appeal 128 of 2018W Karanja, LK Kimaru & AO Muchelule, JJASeptember 6, 2024BetweenAmos KirinyaAppellantandRepublicRespondent(An appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Meru  (D.S. Majanja, J.) dated 17th October 2018 in  HCCRA No. 25 OF 2018)Judgment1.The appellant, Amos Kirinya, was on 5thMarch 2018 convicted by the Principal Magistrate at Meru of defilement contrary to section 8(1) and (2) of the Sexual Offence Act, whose particulars were that on 14thand 16thJuly 2016 at (Particulars withheld) Village in (Particulars withheld) Location in Buuri District within Meru County, he intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of J.K. (PW 1), a girl aged 7 years. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal against conviction and sentence was on 17thOctober 2018 dismissed by D.S. Majanja, J. of the High Court at Meru.2.This is a second appeal. Under section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code our jurisdiction is confined to matters of law    only. We will only interfere with the concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below if they were based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or if it is demonstrated that the two courts below acted on wrong principles in making the findings. (See Samwel Warui Karimi -vs- Republic [2016]2eKLR).3.The prosecution evidence on which the appellant was convicted was that he was living in the same house with his child, PW 1. PW 1 was aged 7 and was school-going. On 15thJuly 2016 at night, she was in bed when the appellant said he was going to fetch water. When he returned, he removed his and her clothes and slept on top of her. He removed his penis which he inserted in her vagina. He did this on two consecutive days. He was warning her not to tell anyone and she was promised that she would be bought a big loaf of bread. The next day in the evening at about 7.50pm, PW 2 JKK met the child on the way. She had been chased from home by the appellant. PW 2 interrogated her and took her to his home. He contacted her mother, CM (PW 3), who was staying at (Particulars withheld) market. She came. This is when PW 1 narrated to them that she had been defiled by the appellant. PW 3 contacted both the child’s headteacher and the OCS of Subuiga Police Station. The appellant was arrested. It took a week for PW 1 to be taken to Meru General Hospital. When examined, it was found that her vagina was “okay”. It had no bruises. However, her hymen was    broken. There were numerous blood and puss cells, but no spermatozoa detected. The appellant was charged.4.The appellant denied the charge in sworn defence. He testified that he had been framed. He stated that when he married PW 3, she already had PW 1. While they were living together, he discovered that she had another child. As if this was not enough, one day he found her in his house with another man. This is when he chased her. There was a dispute that escalated up to the Children’s Office over PW 1 and where she should stay. Ultimately, she was staying with one Kathomi but he was responsible for her feeding. PW 3 stole the child from Kathomi. He looked for the child for two weeks. The matter ended up at the Children’s Office. The next thing was that he was arrested and charged.5.This is the evidence on which he was convicted. In confirming the conviction, the learned Judge observed as follows:-“11.The evidence of corroboration was twofold. First, PW 2 found her in state of distress on the material night after she was chased away from home. Second, the medical evidence tended to confirm the fact of penetration.12.The appellant attacked the medical evidence as insufficient. This is explained by the fact that the child was seen one week after the incident and the only evidence of penetration was numerous pus and blood calls. Likewise, the failure to seek medical treatment on      time does not weaken the prosecution case. PW 2 explained in cross- examination that she did not have money and it only after intervention from officers from the school that the child was taken to the police station and then referred to the hospital.”6.The appellant’s complaint before us was contained in the    grounds of appeal as follows:-“1)That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that the prosecution witnesses gave hearsay, contradictory and conflicting testimonies;2.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that the prosecution case was not proved beyond reasonable doubts.3.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that there was vendetta between the mother of the complainant and the appellant.4.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that the expert report did not support the allegations as the expert recited that no spermatozoa seen.5.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that the prosecution failed to summon vital witnesses ie the area manager to support the allegations.6.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts by failing to note that the child was taken to hospital after 7 days.7.That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by failing to give the appellant enough time to prepare his defence, as the defence witnesses were not called.8.That since I cannot recall al the transpired during the trial, I now beg the honourable court to furnish me with the court proceedings and judgment to draft more cogent grounds during the hearing of this appeal.9.That I pray to be present during the hearing of this appeal.”7.We have to determine whether, on the proper re-examination of the evidence before the trial court, the learned Judge’s finding that the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt was sustainable. We shall also consider the appellant’s complaint that there was bad blood between him and PW 3, and whether it was possible that he had been framed. We shall deal with these issues together.8.We have been concerned that, in dismissing the appellant’s defence, the trial court observed that he had not called the persons he had mentioned to come to support his testimony. They included “Kathomi” and “Nyamu”. The court then went on to say the following:-“I do find the accused persons defence not merited at all. In grievances case like this of defilement where the sentence is severe the accused person was if any supposed to      exonerate himself if indeed, he was innocent as claimed by himself (sic).”9.This was complete misdirection on the part of the trial court. It was clear that the appellant’s defence was discounted because he had not called witnesses to support it. It is also clear that the trial court expected the appellant to call evidence to exonerate himself. This is why he had been convicted. Unfortunately, the learned Judge did not pick these misdirections and deal with them, to be able to satisfy himself that, despite them, the appellant had been convicted on safe evidence.10.An accused in a criminal case is convicted on the strength of the prosecution case, and not on the weakness of the defence case. The burden is always on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden never shifts to the accused. Where the accused person raises a defence, it must be weighed against the prosecution case and can only be dismissed if found to be incredible.11.In this case, the appellant told the trial court that he had been framed. Was this claim investigated by the trial court? Did the learned Judge deal with it? Why were PW 3 and the appellant staying apart if they were a couple? If PW 1 was living alone with the appellant, where was PW 3, the mother? According to PW 2:-“The accused had abducted her and we had a      case of the lost child from school………”According to the recorded evidence of the appellant, there was an outstanding case between him and PW 3 over PW 1, and that the Children’s Office was dealing with the matter. Both the courts did not interrogate this. It is evident from the record that the appellant intended to call the Chief and the Children’s Officer as witnesses in his defence. He requested for summons to issue for them to attend. After he testified, the defence case was adjourned severally but the witnesses did not attend. He was apparently not on bond and was relying on the prosecution to help bring the witnesses. The summons had been issued through the police. So, even as the trial court was blaming the appellant for not calling witnesses to exonerate himself, the record showed otherwise. He had tried to get the witnesses but the police did not serve the summons on them.12.It was in the face of the foregoing evidence that the appellant’s claim that he had been framed should have been considered by the two courts below. There was certainly bad blood, a strained relationship, between him and PW 3. There was reason to frame him. The fact that the victim was medically examined a week after the alleged incidents of defilement, in our view, raises suspicion and supports the appellant’s contention that he may have been framed. The claim by the appellant that there was insufficient evidence to prove defilement should have been considered bearing in mind this strained relationship. Yes, the    child’s hymen was broken. But a sexual assault of penetrative nature, given her age and the appellant’s age, would have left the child with obvious injuries to her genitalia. Even if the examination was after a week, there would have been found scars or healing wound to the genitalia.13.In conclusion, we find that the appellant was not convicted on safe evidence. We allow the appeal, quash the conviction and sentence and order the appellant be set at liberty unless he is otherwise lawfully held.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W.

The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by John Nderitu Ngatia, the Appellant himself on the even date.4.The Appellant stated that he was unwell and therefore was not able to lodge the Appeal on time.5.The Respondent in opposition to the application filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by Amos Oeta, an officer of the Respondent, on the 24thApril, 2024 and filed on the same date in which the Respondent raised the following grounds: -a.That the Respondent issued its objection decision to the Appellant vide its letter dated 19thJune 2023, confirming an income tax liability of Kshs.10,640,750 inclusive of penalty and interest.b.That the Appellant only filed and served its Appeal on 5th April 2024, almost 10 months upon issuance of the objection decision.c.That the Appellant has not obtained any order from the Tribunal extending time to file its Appeal out of time.d.That the taxes subject to the objection decision herein have crystallized, in view of the fact that there is no proper appeal.e.That there is no proper appeal on record, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 13(3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act.f.That in view of the fact that there is no proper appeal, no orders can be issued by this Tribunal regarding the improper Appeal.g.That with regard to the application herein, there is no Agency notice adduced before this Court for quashing.h.That in view of the fact that the Tribunal has no sight of the alleged Agency Notice, the Tribunal cannot issue orders against a document that is not before it.i.That the Appellant has failed to prove that the Respondent indeed placed agency notices on its bank accounts at Kenya Commercial Bank and Equity Bank.j.That the Appellant ought to discharge its burden of proof in accordance to Section 56 of theTax Procedures Act, 2015 and he has failed to do so.Analysis and Determination6.The parties in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal that the application be conversed by way of written submission the Appellant filed its submissions which were adopted on 9thMay, 2024. The Respondent did not file any submissions. The Tribunal has considered the Appellant's submissions in arriving at its findings hereinafter.7.The Tribunal perused through the chronology leading to this application and established as follows;a.The Appellant was issued with the Respondent’s decision on 19thJune 2023.b.The Appellant lodged an application to file an Appeal out of time on 8thApril 2024.c.The Appellant further filed an application dated 19thApril 2024 seeking orders to lift Agency Notices to its bankers.8.The jurisdiction for the Tribunal to consider an application for stay of enforcement of any demand or actions on the part of the Respondent that is likely to adversely impact on the proper determination of a matter before the Tribunal is founded under Section 18 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actwhich provides as follows; -‘Where an appeal against a tax decision has been filed under this Act, the Tribunal may make an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision under review as it considers appropriate for the purposes of securing the effectiveness of the proceedings and determination of the appeal.’9.The Tribunal in consideration of the above provision of the law shall first determine the Appellant’s application for leave to file an appeal out of time filed on 8thApril 2024.10.The Tribunals’ jurisdiction for the enlargement of time in the commencement of an appeal process is found under Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actwhich provides as thus: -“(3)The Tribunal may, upon application in writing, extend the time for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).(4)An extension under subsection (3) may be granted owing to absence from Kenya, or sickness, or other reasonable cause that may have prevented the applicant from giving notice of appeal within the specified period.”11.The Tribunal is enjoined to determine the length and reason for the delay when considering an application for the extension of time to appeal out of time. The power to extend time is discretionary and unfettered but the same must be exercised judiciously and it is not a right to be granted to an Applicant.12.In determining whether to extend time, the Tribunal was guided by the court in Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR, where the learned Judge quoted Sir Thomas Bingham M R in Costellow V Somerset County Council (1993)1 All ER 952 where he stated that:“The first principle is that the rules of court and the associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote expeditious dispatch of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of a procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate…. Further, an extension of time is an indulgence from the court by a party in default. He is not entitled to an extension. He has no reasonable or legitimate expectation of receiving one. His only reasonable or legitimate expectation is that the discretion relevant to his application to extend time will be exercised judicially in accordance with established principles of what is fair and reasonable. In those circumstances, it is incumbent on the applicant for an extension of time to provide the court with a full, honest and acceptable explanation of the reasons for the delay. He cannot reasonably expect the discretion to be exercised in his favour, as a defaulter, unless he provides an explanation for the default.”13.On the criteria of the issues to be considered when granting an extension to file an appeal out of time, the Tribunal referred to the case of Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591 where the Court laid a hierarchy of factors to consider when it stated that:-“an applicant must now show, in descending scale of importance, the following factors:-a)That there is merit in his appeal.b)That the extension of time to institute and/or file the appeal will not cause undue prejudice to the respondent; andc)That the delay has not been inordinate.”14.The Tribunal, guided by the principles set out in Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591, Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR and Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 used the following criteria to consider the application.a.Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?b.Whether the appeal is merited?c.Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted?a.          Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?15.In considering what constitutes as a reasonable reason for delay, the court in Balwant Singh v Jagdish Singh & Ors (Civil Appeal No.1166 of 2006), held that:-“The test is whether or not a cause is sufficient to see whether it could have been avoided by the party by the exercise of due care and attention”.16.The statutory timelines and provisions to file an appeal have been clearly set out in the Tax Appeal Tribunal Act. Section 13 (3) of the Act provides as follows with regard to the statutory timelines in commencing an appeal process:-“A notice of appeal to the Tribunal shall—(a)be in writing;(b)be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.(2)The appellant shall, within fourteen days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, submit enough copies, as may be advised by the Tribunal, of—(a)a memorandum of appeal;(b)statements of facts; and(c)the tax decision.”17.From the chronology of events, the Tribunal notes the Respondent decision was issued on 19thJune 2023 and therefore the Appellant ought to have filed its Notice of Appeal on or before 19thJuly 2023. This application for enlargement of time was filed on 8thApril 2024 which is more than 8 months delay .18.The Tribunal noted from the Appellant’s pleadings that the Appellant had cited illness. The Appellant however did not demonstrate in any way with documentary evidence the nature and length of the illness.19.However, the Tribunal did not find, this casual explanation without any form of evidence, sufficient to trigger it to exercise its discretion as provided for under Section 13(3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act. The Tribunal in the circumstances is of the considered view that the Appellant has not advanced reasonable cause of delay to approach the Tribunal to vindicate its right to appeal against the tax demands by the Respondent.20.The Tribunal therefore found it unnecessary to analyze the other issues for its determination on extension of time.21.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant filed the Appeal on the 8thApril, 2024 simultaneously with the application for enlargement of time. The Appeal in the light of the foregoing finding on the application for the enlargement of time is incompetent and thus unsustainable in law.22.On whether the Tribunal could issue stay orders in relations to the agency notices, the Tribunal hereby determines that its powers donated by Section 18 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actare limited to preservation of a matter pending before it. Having determined that there is no proper Appeal pending before it, the Tribunal finds that the prayer for orders to lift the Agency Notices cannot be sustained.Disposition23.Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the application lack merits and the Appeal filed therewith is incompetent and the Orders that recommend themselves are as follows;a.The both applications dated 8thApril, 2024 and 19thApril, 2024 be and are hereby dismissed.b.The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.c.No orders as to costs.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -  CHAIRMANABRAHAM K.

Its main form of business is in the installation and servicing of industrial solar plants, fiberglass-reinforced PPR piping systems, and photovoltaic solar systems.2.The Respondent is a principal officer under Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya. The Kenya Revenue Authority (“KRA”) is an agency of the Government of Kenya for assessing, collecting, and accounting for all tax revenue.3.The Respondent conducted a desk review of customs on the Appellant’s consignments of aqua hot storage tanks for the period between August 2021 to August 2022.4.The Respondent found that the aqua hot storage tanks imported by the Appellant had been misclassified under tariff codes 8404.10.00 and 8419.90.00 which attract Import duty and VAT of 0% when the applicable tariff classification for Aqua Hot Water tanks is 8516.10.00, which attracts Import duty of 25% and VAT of 16%.5.The Respondent issued a demand notice to the Appellant on 24thFebruary 2023.6.The Appellant applied for a review vide a letter dated 7thJune 2023 which was rejected by the Respondent on 20thJune 2023 for being late thereby upholding its position on the reclassification of the tariff.7.Being dissatisfied with the review decision, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal dated 4thAugust 2023.The Appeal8.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds listed in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 3rdAugust 2023 and filed on 4thAugust 2023:-a.That the Respondent’s demand notice dated 24thFebruary 2023 and the review decision dated 20thJanuary 2023 is arbitrary, unlawful, and therefore null and void.b.That at the time of the importation of the Aqua Hot water tanks which are solar water heating tanks, the taxpayer correctly classified the dual water heating system under tariff code no. 8419.19.00 and accordingly, the Commissioner erred in law and fact in classifying the coil solar water heating system under tariff Code 8516.19.00.c.That there is no dispute that the Aqua hot-water tanks and accessories imported are designed to operate purely on the solar system. Therefore, there is no basis whatsoever as to why the Commissioner has chosen to employ HS Code 8516.16 slotted for electrical components. Accordingly, the Respondent erred in law and in fact in classifying the water heating system as electrical instead of solar.d.That Respondent erred in law and in fact in failing to recognise that the East Africa Community Common External Tariff 2017 version clearly states that HS Code 8516.10.00 is meant for electric instantaneous or storage water heaters and immersion heaters which read as under.i.Electric instantaneous or storage water heaters and immersion heaters -u 25%ii.-Electric space heating apparatus and electric soil heating apparatus:e.That the aqua hot water storage tank being imported by the Appellant is not an electric instantaneous or storage water heater but purely a solar water heater storage tank.f.That the Commissioner’s decision leading to the demand is contrary to established principles of interpreting the tax code and the Respondent erred in law and fact in failing to resolve the issue in favour of the taxpayer by employing HS Code 8419.19.00 which is zero-rated.g.That the Respondent erred in law and in failing to hold that aqua hot water storage solar heating panel did not fall among those equipment classified under Chapter 85 of the East Africa Community Common External Tariff 2017 version and that even if the Respondent wanted to employ the ejusdem generis rule, still the imported goods could not be grouped among those specified under Chapter 85.h.That the Respondent erred in law and fact in failing to recognize that the fresh assessments and demands made would exert unnecessary and illegal expenses on the Appellant who already sold the goods based on a zero-rated coding.i.That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to consider that its conduct of re-coding the items meant that Kenya would adopt its special unique HS coding contrary to the universal standard set by the Harmonised Commodity Description and coding system developed by the World Customs Organisation (WCO) and accordingly, its conduct is discriminatory since the Appellant is assessed on a different scale as compared to every other person across the globe.j.That the Appellant erred in law and fact by imposing a principal tax of Kshs. 3,883,901.00.Appellant’s Case9.The Appellant’s case was premised on:a.Statement of Facts dated 3rdAugust 2023 and filed on 4thAugust 2023.b.Appellant’s written submissions dated 7thJune 2024 and filed on 10thJune 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.10.The Appellant stated that the Respondent issued a demand notice dated 24thFebruary 2023 of Kshs. 4,505,320.00 pursuant to Sections 235 and 236 of the EACCMA via an email of the same date which the Appellant did not receive.11.The Appellant averred that the Respondent then called its offices on 27thApril 2023 to find out whether it had received its email and followed up with an email on the same day stating that it was still awaiting a response.12.The Appellant contended that it had a similar case under the Tribunal of TAT No. 179 of 2022 and informed the Respondent during the phone call that the matter was at the Tribunal and they could only await the decision but did not realise that the demand was for a different amount as opposed to the one whose decision had been received.13.The Appellant averred that through its tax representative, it wrote to the Respondent via a letter dated 7thJune 2023 informing it that the Tribunal had issued a Judgment on 12thMay 2023 and the Appellant did not have any outstanding liability. It added that that was an oversight as the tax representative did not as well realise that this was a different case altogether and the letter was received duly by the Kenya Revenue Authority on even date.14.The Appellant stated that the Respondent then issued a review decision on the demanded duties on 20thJune 2023 explaining that they were two separate demands and the Judgment notice from the Tribunal did not cover the second case which deems the Appellant imported aqua hot water tanks using the HS Code 8419.90.00 and 8404.10 yet the Respondent deems the correct HS code to be 8516.10.00.15.The Appellant quoted HS Codes 8404.10.09; 8419.90.00; and 8516.10.00 of the East Africa Community Common External Tariff 2017 version and contended that it imports aqua hot water tanks single coil and can only be used for solar components and it is for this reason that the KEBS pre-export certificate of conformity classifies them as solar water storage tanks single coil.16.The Appellant averred that the products it imported were purely solar water heater systems and do not have any electrical components and there is no reason as to why the Respondent would classify the solar systems in question under 8516.10.00.17.The Appellant averred that the Respondent’s demand letter of 24thFebruary 2023 stated that that the wrong classification of the HS code by the Appellant could be justified by the extra taxes paid by the Appellant after interception of the entry number 23MBAIM400545649 of the original version.18.That the Respondent therefore deemed the extra payment of taxes by the Appellant as a sign of acceptance that he was using the wrong HS code. That further, it was important to note that the Appellant was under duress and it had to pay the extra taxes to be able to obtain its goods so that it could sell.19.That the Appellant claimed that indeed nonpayment of the extra taxes meant that the Appellant was to continue to pay for the demurrage which was going to be an extra cost that would result in losses and that this was unfair to the Appellant.20.The Appellant claimed that it paid the extra taxes under protest as per its letter dated 16thFebruary 2023.21.The Appellant stated that the Respondent’s review decision dated 20thJune 2023 is arbitrary, unlawful, therefore null and void and that at the time of importation of the Solar water heating systems, the taxpayer correctly classified the solar water heating system under tariff Code 8419.19.00 and 8404.10 accordingly, that the Commissioner erred in law and fact in classifying the dual water heating system under the tariff code no. 8516.19.00.Appellant’s prayers.22.The Appellant consequently prayed that the Tribunal:-a.Allows this Appeal and sets aside the review decision dated 20thJune 2023.b.Finds that the Appellant is not liable to pay any taxes with regards to the Respondent’s impugned assessment and demand for the tax;c.The Respondent be condemned to bear the cost of this Appeal; andd.Be pleased to issue any other order favourable to the Appellant as it may deem just and fair to issue.Respondent’s Case23.The Respondent’s case was premised on:a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 25thOctober 2023 and filed on 26thOctober 2023;b.The Respondent’s Preliminary Objection dated and filed on 15thApril 2024; andc.The Respondent’s Written Submissions dated and filed on 15thApril 2024.24.The Respondent stated that the Notice of Appeal is out of time in contradiction of Sections 13(1)(b) and 3 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 and Rule 3(1)(b) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 2015, thus is defective and the Appeal is therefore an abuse of the process of the Tribunal and a waste of resources.25.The Respondent stated that the basis of its decision dated 20thJune 2023 is premised on the late Objection review made by the Appellant without justifiable/reasonable cause and not related to the correct classification of the Appellant’s product aqua hot water tank.26.The Respondent reiterated that the Appellant’s grounds of Appeal were invalid and misguided as they were not aligned to the Respondent’s basis of its decision thus a Preliminary Objection had to be raised.27.The Respondent relied on Section 236 of the EACCMA and contended that the review decision was correctly and unjustly arrived at with respect to the tariff classification of its imported items and consequential demands issued and that the Respondent was within its mandate to verify the accuracy of the goods imported by the Appellant and issue the demands on short-levied taxes.28.The Respondent cited HS Code 8516.19.00 and averred that GIR 1 provided that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes, provided the Headings and Notes do not require otherwise, according to GIRs 2 through 6 and thus the hot water storage tanks are classifiable in Heading 8516.29.The Respondent stated that the Appellant’s product is used for storing hot water with immersion heating elements wherein water is heated gradually and that the water heaters have thermosiphon glass tubes and electrical heating elements.30.The Respondent added that the water heaters are installed on the roof, terrace, or where sunlight is available and heats water which is later stored in an insulated storage tank for various uses. It added that the storage tanks vary in capacities of 120L, 200L, 300L, and 500L with the key provisions of affixing an electrical heating element; thermosiphon glass tubes for heating the water, a sensor pocket for affixing a sensor for water temperature regulation, a temperature and pressure provision for affixing a temperature and pressure valve.31.The Respondent averred that the electrical heating is used when the heating process using solar is not sufficient.32.The Respondent quoted Heading 8419 which covers machinery, plant or laboratory equipment, whether or not electrically heated (excluding furnaces, ovens, and other equipment of Heading 8514), for the treatment of materials by a process involving a change of temperatures such as heating, cooking, roasting, distilling, rectifying, sterilising, pasteurising, steaming, drying, evaporating, vaporising, condensing or cooling, other than machinery or plant of a kind used for domestic purposes; instantaneous or storage water heaters, non-electric.33.The Respondent further quoted Heading 8516 which covers electric instantaneous or storage water heaters and immersion heaters; electric space heating apparatus and soil heating apparatus; electro-thermic hair-dressing apparatus (for example, hair dryers, hair curlers, curling tong heaters) and hand dryers; electric smoothing irons; other electrothermic appliances of a kind used for domestic purposes; electric heating resistors, other than those of Heading 8545.34.The Respondent contended that the two possible Headings are to be considered per the provisions of GIR 3 as the legal basis of the classification as GIR 3(a) is not applicable because the heading refers to part of the system. It added that Rule (b) is not applicable as the heating system using solar power is not regarded as giving the essential character of the product, taking into consideration that even if the solar panel is removed, the product can still function as the electrical element.35.The Respondent averred that Rule 3(c) is applicable in the classification of the Appellant’s product under Heading 8516 by application of GIR 1, 2, 3(c), and 6 and by dint of Rule 3(c), the Heading that occurs last shall be used.36.The Respondent averred that in any case, the aqua water storage tank and accessories can be imported solely without the solar system and in such a case, it cannot qualify to be classified under Chapter 84 since it is not a machine, a plant or laboratory equipment as stated in those headings thus it is classifiable under Heading 8516.37.The Respondent further averred that there is no HS Code 8419.19.00 which is zero-rated under EAC/CET and puts the Appellant to strict proof thereof.38.On whether the Respondent’s Preliminary Objection has merit, the Respondent submitted that at the heart of the Preliminary Objection is the determination of whether there is a proper Appeal before the Tribunal and that the ground of the Preliminary Objection is premised on the fact that the Appellant had filed an Appeal without adhering to the mandatory rules of the Tribunal on filing the Appeal.39.The Respondent argued that the Appellant was challenging the Respondent’s decision of 20thJune 2020 and filed both the Notice of Appeal and Memorandum of Appeal on 4thAugust 2023 and therefore the Notice of Appeal was out of time.40.The Respondent cited Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actand asserted that the Appellant ought to have filed a Notice of Appeal within 30 days from the date of the decision and filed a substantive appeal in 14 days but the Appellant failed to adhere to the timelines as the Notice of Appeal ought to have been filed by 19thJuly 2023.41.The Respondent relied on Section 13(3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actand submitted that upon the lapse of timelines, the Appellant had an option of seeking more time to be allowed to file its appeal but failed to do so and the Appellant cannot select at its own discretion when to file the appeal without leave being granted after a delay of over 4 years.42.The Respondent reiterated that the Tribunal has the discretion to admit the late appeal if conditions for granting the same are met which include absence from Kenya, sickness or any other reasonable cause that may have prevented a person from lodging the appeal. Therefore, where a taxpayer is late in lodging an appeal, it is suicidal for him to prosecute the appeal unless and until leave is sought and granted by the Tribunal.43.The Respondent maintained that the Appellant did not disclose any reason as to why there was such an inordinate delay and that, despite the delay, the Appellant equally did not find it necessary and proper to make an application so that the Appeal is admitted out of time or allowed more time to put in its appeal.44.The Respondent relied the case of Nairobi H.C. Misc. Civil Application No. 81 of 2011Republic v The Commissioner of Customs Services; Ex-parte: SDV Transami to buttress its position that the Appellant is guilty of inordinate delay and deliberately failed to seek an enlargement of time to file its appeal rendering the appeal as not properly before the Tribunal.45.Further the Respondent relied on the cases of Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat v IEBC & 6 Others [2013] eKLR, and Civil Appeal No. 142 of 2013 Dipack Kenya vs William Muthama Kitonyi (2018) eKLR where the court approvingly cited the case of Daphne Parry v Murray Alexander Carson [1963] EA 546 and reiterated that the Appellant had been indolent in prosecuting its Appeal and therefore the Tribunal ought not to aid it any further.46.The Respondent posited that even if the Honourable Tribunal were to find that the delay is not inordinate, and being clothed with the discretion to admit appeals out of time, a further question must be asked whether there exists a reasonable cause disclosed by the Appellant in explaining the delay and none exists.47.On whether the Respondent’s decision dated 20thJune 2023 was correct the Respondent submitted that the basis of the Appeal is not in substance a decision related to the correct classification of the Appellant’s product, the aqua hot water tank.48.The Appellant averred that the Appellant’s grounds of appeal were invalid and misguided as they are not aligned to the Respondent’s basis of its decision.49.The Respondent reiterated that it issued a demand on 24thFebruary 2023 and corresponded with the Appellant to respond to the demand if it were dissatisfied with the same. That it was only on 7thJune 2023 did the Appellant lodge an application or review (over 4 months late).50.The Respondent averred that in the late application for review, the Appellant alleged that it was misguided on the basis that the demand had been conclusively determined by a previous decision of the Tribunal which was erroneous and the Appellant could not provide any reason for the delay of lodging a late application for review and thus the same was rejected.Respondent’s prayers51.The Respondent prays for orders that this Tribunal:-a.Affirms the Respondent’s decision dated 20thJune 2023.b.Dismisses this Appeal with costs.Issues For Determination52.The Tribunal having evaluated the pleadings and submissions of the parties is of the view that there are two issues that call for its determination:a.Whether the Respondents’ preliminary objection dated 15thApril 2024 was merited?b.Whether the Respondent’s decision to re-classify the Aqua Hot water storage tanks under HS code 8516.10 was justified?Analysis And Findings53.The Tribunal having determined the issues falling for its determination proceeds to analyse the same as hereunder.a.Whether the Respondent’s preliminary objection dated 15thApril 2024 was merited?54.The Respondent vide its Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 15thApril 2024 stated that the Appeal offended Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act. The Respondent argued that since the Appeal was lodged outside 30 days it should be dismissed.55.The Tribunal is guided by Section 230 of the EACCMA which provides as follows:“(1)A person dissatisfied with the decision of the commissioner under section 229 may appeal to a tax appeals tribunal established in accordance with section 2312.A person intending to lodge an appeal under this section shall lodge the appeal within forty-five days after being served with the decisions, and shall serve a copy of the appeal on the commissioner.”56.The Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s review decision was issued on 20thJune 2023 and the Appeal was lodged on the 4thof August 2023, exactly 45 days after the Commissioner issued its review decision.57.The Tribunal is of the considered view that the provisions of Section 230 of EACCMA are express and an unequivocal and finds that the Appeal was not filed out of time as submitted by the Respondent. Further, the Tribunal finds that Sections 13(1)(b) and 3 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 and Rule 3(1)(b) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 2015, are not applicable in this instant Appeal.58.The Tribunal therefore finds that the Respondent’s Preliminary objection dated 15thApril 2024 was not merited.b. Whether the Respondent was justified to reject the late application for review59.The Respondent based its decision dated 20thJune 2023 on the late application for review made by the Appellant without justifiable/reasonable cause.60.The Respondent on 20thJune 2023 acknowledged receipt of the letter referenced NAMS/SIL/2023dated 7thJune 2023 wherein the Appellant had applied for review of a decision made by the Respondent in demand referenced KRA/CBC/RMD/PCA/2023(DMD) dated 24thFebruary 2023.61.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant applied for review more than three months after the Respondent issued a tax demand.62.It was the Appellant’s case that the reason for late application for review was that it was misguided on the Respondent’s demand issued on 24thFebruary 2023 as it thought the demand dated 24thFebruary 2024 was related to a matter that the Tribunal had rendered a decision dated 12thMay 2023 with respect to classification for dual solar water heater.63.The Tribunal notes that it is undisputed by the parties that the Respondent called the Appellant’s offices on 27thApril 2023 to find out whether the Appellant had received its email communicating the tax demand dated 24thFebruary 2023.64.The Tribunal further notes the Respondent issued its review decision on 20thJune 2023, stating therein that contrary to the Appellant’s reason for filing its review application late, that the matter the Appellant was referring to and the demand dated 24thFebruary 2023 related to two separate issues and that the Tribunal’s Judgment did not cover the instant case.65.The Tribunal also notes that even after the follow-up made by the Respondent on 27thApril 2023, the Appellant only applied for review of the Respondent’s decision on 7thJune 2023.66.The Tribunal is guided by Section 229(1), (2) and (3) of the East African Community Customs Management Act (EACCMA) which provides as follows: -“(1)A person directly affected by the decision or omission of the Commissioner or any other officer on matters relating to Customs shall within thirty days of the date of the decision or omission lodge an application for decision or omission(2)The application referred to under subsection (1) shall be lodged with the Commissioner in writing stating the grounds upon which it is lodged.(3)Where the Commissioner is satisfied that, owing to absence from the Partner State, sickness or other reasonable cause, the person affected by the decision or omission of the Commissioner was unable to lodge an application specified in subsection (1), and there has been no unreasonable delay by the person in lodging the application, the Commissioner may accept the application lodged after the time specified in subsection (1).”67.The Tribunal is also guided by the case of Republic v Kenya Revenue Authority & another Ex-Parte Kenya Nut Company Limited [2014] eKLR where the court observed that tax statutes must be strictly interpreted. It stated at Paragraph40as follows: -“the rules of interpreting tax statutes bars the Tax Authority or the tax payer from seeking to establish the intention of Parliament as such statutes should be interpreted strictly. In support of this submission the Respondents relied on Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. Inland Revenue Commissioner [1921] 1 KB 64. In that case it was held:“In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly stated. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about tax. There is no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only lock fairly at the language used.”68.It is therefore the Tribunals considered view that it was not until 7thJune 2023 that the Appellant lodged an application for review of a decision issued on 24thFebruary 2023. This was clearly outside the 30 days permissible timeline for the making of an application for review. Further, the Tribunal notes that the Appellant failed to provide a reasonable cause for its delay in applying for review in accordance with Section 229(3) of EACCMA. The manifest inordinate delay was inspite of the fact that the Appellant had even been reminded of the tax decision by the Respondent on the 27thApril, 2024.69.Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal is persuaded that the Respondent was justified to reject the late application for review by the Appellant.Final Decision70.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal lacks merit and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:-a.This Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Respondent’s decision dated 20thJune 2023 be and is hereby upheld.c.Each party to bear its own costs.71.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RDDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANEUNICE N.

      [2024] KETAT 1244 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalTax Appeal E424 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, Cynthia B. Mayaka, RO Oluoch, T Vikiru & AK Kiprotich, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenCapwell Industries LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Customs and Border ControlRespondentJudgmentBackground1.The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated in Kenya whose principal activity is manufacturing of high quality maize flour, pulses, rice, porridge and wheat flour.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, and is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.3.Pursuant to a post clearance audit, the Respondent issued a management letter dated 19thJanuary 2023. The Respondent further vide a letter dated 19thApril 2023 raised a demand notice for taxes amounting to Kshs 145,185,298.00.4.The Appellant objected to the demand vide a letter dated 19thMay 2023. The Respondent subsequently issued its review decision vide a letter dated 16thJune 2023 confirming tax assessments amounting to Kshs 140,830,343.86 being Import duty, Import VAT, IDF and RDL.5.Following the Respondent's decision, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal at the Tribunal on 14thJuly, 2023.The Appeal6.From the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal dated 31stJuly, 2023 the Tribunal discerned the grounds to be as follows:-a.The Respondent has based its review decision, solely, on the variance between the aggregate CIF declared during the year 2021 and 2022 and the total bank debits highlighted by the Respondent as relating to the payments made to the Appellant's exporters.b.That the Appellant provided complete reconciliation showing an entry to entry comparison of amount invoiced and amount paid to the said suppliers.c.That the Respondent availed the Appellant with detailed workings of what guided the Respondent to the conclusion that Kshs 145,185,298.00 was the incremental tax on under declared imports.d.That the Appellant declared its goods in the foreign currency as invoiced to them and paid the suppliers of those goods in the equivalent foreign currency value invoiced, from their respective Kenyan bank accounts.e.That in the Appellant's application for review, it requested for a breakdown of the import entries the Respondent claims were under declared, in order to enable the Applicant substantiate the amount of taxes in question.Appellant’s Case7.The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents filed before the Tribunal;a.Its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 31stJuly 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.Its written submissions dated 12thJune 2024.8.The Appellant stated that it was seeking to completely object to the audit test used on the basis that it was flawed and did not reflect the spirit of the Fourth Schedule of the EACCMA. That duties, taxes and any relevant levies are charged on customs value relating to a specific transaction. That as evidenced in it's review application, this audit test will inadvertently include payments to foreign suppliers that don't relate to purchase of goods or payment in foreign currency and payments made to local suppliers of goods and services. That in addition, depending on the contract terms and business relationship, payment terms in international business are mostly; partly in advance and partly after the imported goods have arrived at the country of importation.9.That the Respondent had also failed to pinpoint the exact import entry whose transaction value was under-declared for the purpose of calculating duty and taxes. That an entry to entry comparison would have shed more light on if, an offence was committed in the valuation of imports by the Appellant.10.That the Appellant had availed information of the import entries, the bank debits the Respondent picked that were used to settle and eliminated some payments that did not relate to items that would form part of the customs value. That its expectation was that the Respondent, should then have made a comparison of apples and apples but conversely, the Respondent stuck to its guns in the review decision and went on to add other bank debits not earlier used as a basis of establishing the transaction value in the demand letter, and adjusted the demand downward to Kshs.140,830,343.11.That this does not provide enough reason to uplift the value of the Appellant's imports. It averred that all adjustments to the transaction value were made in line with Paragraph 9 of the Fourth Schedule of EACCMA and reflect the true price actually paid for the imported goods.12.The Appellant stated that it provided excel schedule indicating payment of the amount invoiced by showing the following information;a.CIF value declared per entry.b.Amount paid to supplier per entry, relating to every import entryc.Date the amounts were paid to the suppliers as per the bank statement.d.Remitting bank of the payment to the said exporters.e.Entries relating to free of charge goods, which payment would not be due to the suppliers.13.That it was based on the detailed workings provided by the Respondent, that the Appellant prepared a comprehensive defence and fully discharged its burden of proving that the earlier demand should not stand, and that using the audit test, after evidence adduced, would create an impression that the Appellant actually over declared the value of imported goods for the assessed years.14.That the Respondent agreed to its claim and conversely, introduced new bank debit entries to adjust the demanded amount downwards to Ksh 140,830,343.86 instead of vacating the full amount as premised by the Appellant's application for review. The Appellant submitted that the wheels of justice started rolling immediately the customs demand and workings, that brought about the demanded amount were issued.15.That introducing new evidence contradicts Article 47 ofthe Constitutionand its client's right to fair administrative action. That the KRA is prevented from re-calibrating the fundamental basis of the demand letter dated 19thApril 2023. That the new workings and demanded amount would require a resetting of the clock; hence a new demand letter having those new issues should be issued by the Respondent.16.That the demanded amount should therefore be reviewed downward to Nil/zero in line with the demand and corresponding application to review the demand. That this is buttressed by the High Court in Commissioner of Domestic Taxes vs Bank of Africa Limited. That having new workings which were not part of the demand, amounts to an attempt to unfairly tip the scales of justice in the Respondent’s favour.17.The Appellant submitted that a comparison of the currency value declared vis-a-vis the currency value in the commercial invoice, and bank debits asserts the position that the foreign currency value invoiced equals the amount paid and declared.18.That Article 9 of the WTO agreement on customs valuation states that; lf conversion of currency is necessary for the determination of customs value, the rate of exchange to be used shall be that duly published by the competent authorities of the country of importation concerned. That Section 122 (7) of EACCMA states that “The rate of exchange to be used for determining the equivalent of a Partner State currency of any foreign currency shall be the selling rate last notified by the Central Bank of the respective Partner State when an entry is presented to and accepted by the proper officer.”19.That considering some payments were done in advance for imports, the exchange rate at the time of declaration, time advance payment was made and time the final payment was made for the same import will inherently be different and this would inadvertently affect the amount, in local currency, that will be paid to the suppliers and declared. That a comparison of USD to USD would assert that the Appellant did not undervalue its imports for customs purposes.20.That a legitimate expectation was therefore created by the KRA in its ICMS or SIMBA 2014, that the exchange rate at the time of declaration that would then yield the customs value in local currency and taxes to be paid will not be adjusted in a later PCA. That the only reason for the adjustment should be if the PAPP in foreign currency differs from the foreign currency declared as a transaction value in the customs system.21.The Appellant stated that the Respondent, conducted a Post Clearance Audit (""PCA"") of it's customs operations for the period January 2018 to December 2022. That thereafter some issues were raised relating to customs valuation for the period 2021 and 2022 through a management letter and demand notice dated 19thJanuary 2023 and 19thApril 2023 respectively.22.That the Respondent through the management letter, provided the following reasons for its allegations of undervaluation which inadvertently led to the uplifted duty, levies and taxes;a.A variance was found after comparing all payments made to the Appellant's suppliers through its USD bank accounts and CIF declarations made in the customs system and used as basis of calculating duty. That the variance amounted to Ksh 104,574,719.36 and Ksh 207,651,726.57 for the year 2021 and 2022 respectively.b.That the aforementioned variance was then treated as under-declaration of the aggregate transaction value of imports for the year 2021 and 2022 hence the demand notice dated 19thApril 2023 for the uplifted duty and taxes.23.That the Respondent's demand related to customs duty, VAT, IDF and RDL, and amounted to Ksh 145,185,298 exclusive of penalty as shown in the table below;Details   (KES)Customs Duty   78,056,611.48Value Added Tax  49,956,231.35IDF   10,927,925.61RDL   6,244,528.92Total  145,185,297.3624.That the Appellant made an application to the Respondent to review the decision to demand Kshs 145,185,297.36, on 19thMay 2023.25.That the Appellant's application was premised on the following grounds:a.That the Respondent has erred in fact by alluding that the 2021 and 2022 variances, all relate to payments made to Appellant's suppliers from abroad.b.That the Respondent has contradicted itself in law by erroneously including certain costs as part of the CIF valuation; By including costs incurred in cargo handling and transport, after the goods arrive at the port of Mombasa which would form part of the customs value for purposes of calculating taxes. This was asserted by invoices relating to some of the bank debits that made up the demanded amount.c.That the Commissioner has misapplied itself in law and fact by the method used in adjusting the transaction value of Appellant's imports in 2021 and 2022.d.That the Appellant complied with all customs laws in its declarations and all foreign currency payments match the foreign currency invoiced and declared to customs.26.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent averred that it was led to believe, that all bank payments used to establish if the correct transaction value was declared in both years, related to actual payments to foreign suppliers for imports made during the years. That the demand notice was hence premised on the information received from the Appellant.27.That the Respondent reviewed the amount demanded downwards from Ksh 145,185,298 to Ksh 140,830,343.86.28.The Appellant stated that the Respondent in working out the reviewed amount, introduced new bank debit entries and used the new totals as a yardstick of establishing the correctness of the declared transaction value in the year 2021 and 2022.29.That the Appellant prayed that the Respondent be authorized to set aside the review decision in light of the Memorandum of Appeal.Appellant’s Prayers30.The Appellant made the prayers that;a.The review decision dated 16thJune 2023 be annulled and set aside in its entirety.b.The Appeal be allowed.c.Any other remedies that the Tribunal deems just and reasonable.The Respondent’s Case31.The Respondent’s case is premised on the hereunder filed documents before the Tribunal: -a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated and filed on 31stAugust, 2023.b.The Respondent’s written submissions filed on 11thJune 2024.32.The Respondent stated that the dispute arose as a result of it's decision to uphold the demand notice on the basis of undervaluation. That the Appellant failed to prove the price actually paid or payable as per the provisions of Section 122 of the Fourth Schedule of EACCMA 2004.33.That upon the conclusion of the audit, it was revealed that there was undervaluation of imported goods for the years 2021 and 2022. It averred that this was due to differences in the aggregate amount of Cost Insurance and Freight (CIF) declared for the goods and the total remittances to the suppliers as captured below:YearBank RemittancesCIFDifferences20211,437,892,750.371,333,318,031.08104,574,719.3620212,099,084,418.651,887,097,692.08207,651,726.5734.It submitted that the bank remittances were then sent to the Appellant for reconciliation. That they were then reconciled and remarked with the supplier's name and indicated as imports.35.The Respondent submitted that in the Appellant's objection a contrary opinion was provided and some of the remittances marked as imports were reneged as cost. That the Respondent however adjusted the payments in relation to the Appellant's averments.36.That the Appellant therefore having been trusted to provide truthful and accurate information to the Respondent, failed and provided misleading information and misrepresented the facts.37.That Section 122(1) of the EACCMA 2004 provides that where imported goods are liable to import duty ad valorem then the value of such goods shall be determined in accordance with the Fourth Schedule and import duty shall be paid on that value.38.That the transaction value is defined in Paragraph 2 of the Fourth Schedule as the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the partner state adjusted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph9.39.It added that Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade lays down the General Principles for an International System of Valuation.40.That it stipulates that the value for Customs purposes of imported merchandise should be based on the actual value of the imported merchandise on which duty is assessed.41.That the actual value must be the price at which the goods are sold. That it therefore requires that the total payments made to the suppliers of goods have to be faithfully declared as the customs value for the goods imported.42.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to reconcile and account for all the entries under audit. That it could not link all the entries to the bank remittances. That from the reconciled USD Guardian Bank account for both 2021 and 2022 it was noted that the Appellant only accounted for 82 entries out of 139 entries.43.That the CIF for 2021 and 2022 were forwarded to the Appellant's email address on 27thMarch 2023 and it would therefore have been expected of the Appellant to account for remittances vis a vis the CIF which the Appellant failed.44.That from the onset of the audit the issue under contention was undervaluation of imported goods for the years 2021 and 2022.45.The Respondent stated that it audited the books of accounts of the Appellant and issued a letter dated 19thJanuary 2023 showing anomalies in the importations and declarations and the undervalued taxes.46.The Respondent averred that in its letter it called for payment of taxes assessed at Kshs.145,185,297.36. That the Appellant did not respond to these findings or payment of these taxes.47.That consequently, the Respondent on 19thApril 2023 issued a demand notice for the taxes.48.The Respondent submitted that it relied on the following provisions of the law;a.Sections 135, 229, 235, 236, 249 and the Fifth Schedule of the EACCMA 2004.b.Sections 235 and 236 that gives the Commissioner powers to call for documents and conduct a PCA on the import and export operations of a taxpayer within a period of five years from the date of importation or exportation.c.Where the PCA reveals that taxes were short levied, or erroneously refunded, Section 135 and 249(1) empowers the Commissioner to recover any such amount short levied or erroneously refunded with interest at a rate of two percent per month for the period the taxes remain unpaid.d.Section 229 that provides for application for review by any person affected by the decision or omission of the Commissioner on matters relating to Customs and provides the statutory timelines to be observed.49.On the reason for its decision the Respondent stated that it is mandated to collect and record accurate traded statistics and to assess and account for import taxes.Respondent’s Prayers50.The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal considers the case and find that;a.That the Appeal herein be dismissed with cost to the Respondent.b.The Respondents decision be allowed.Issue For Determination51.The Tribunal upon due consideration of the pleadings and the written submissions of the parties was of the considered view that the Appeal raises a single issue for its determination being:-Whether the Respondent’s review decision was justifiedAnalysis And Determination52.The Tribunal having ascertained the issue for determination as set out above proceeds to deal with the same as hereunder53.This dispute arose following the Respondent’s review decision dated 16thJune 2023 wherein it confirmed duties relating to the Appellant’s imports amounting to Kshs 140,830,343.86 on the basis that the Appellant had undervalued the same at the time of importation.54.Under the EACCMA the transaction value method is the primary method of valuation which provides as follows regarding the transaction value of goods at Paragraph 2(1) of the Fourth Schedule:“The customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the Partner State adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 9, but where—(a)there are no restrictions as to the disposition or use of the goods by the buyer other than restrictions which:(i)are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the Partner State;(ii)limit the geographical area in which the goods may be resold; or(iii)do not substantially affect the value of the goods;(b)the sale or price is not subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued;(c)no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 9; and(d)the buyer and seller are not related, or where the buyer and seller are related, that the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes under the provisions of subparagraph (2).”55.In the instant case, the Appellant averred that duties, taxes and any relevant levies are charged on customs value relating to a specific transaction. That as evidenced in its review application, the Respondent’s audit test would inadvertently include payments to foreign suppliers that don't relate to purchase of goods or payment, payments in foreign currency made to local suppliers of goods and services. That in addition, depending on the contract terms and business relationship, payment terms in international business are mostly; partly in advance and partly after the imported goods have arrived at the country of importation.56.That the Respondent had also failed to pinpoint the exact import entry whose transaction value was under-declared for the purpose of calculating duty and taxes. That an entry to entry comparison would have shed more light on if, an offence was committed in the valuation of imports by the Appellant.57.That the Appellant had availed information of the import entries, the bank debits the Respondent picked that were used to settle and eliminated some payments that did not relate to items that would form part of the customs value. That its expectation was that the Respondent, should then make a comparison of apples and apples but conversely, the Respondent stuck to its guns in the review decision and went on to add other bank debits not earlier used as a basis of establishing the transaction value in the demand letter, and adjusted the demand downward to Ksh 140,830,343.58.In reply the Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to prove the price actually paid or payable as per the provisions of Section 122 of the Fourth Schedule of EACCMA 2004.59.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to reconcile and account for all the entries under audit. That it could not link all the entries to the bank remittances. That from the reconciled USD Guardian Bank account for both 2021 and 2022 it was noted that the Appellant only accounted for 82 entries out of 139 entries.60.That the CIF for 2021 and 2022 were forwarded to the Appellant's email address on 27thMarch 2023 and it would therefore have been expected of the Appellant to account for remittances vis a vis the CIF which the Appellant failed.61.Section 122(1) of EACCMA provides as follows regarding determination of the value of imported goods liable for ad valorem import duty;“Where imported goods are liable to import duty ad valorem, then the value of such goods shall be determined in accordance with the Fourth Schedule and import duty shall be paid on that value.”62.The Tribunal has reviewed the documents provided by the parties and the pleadings and notes that the method of valuation was not in contention by the parties. The only issue that was raised by the Respondent in the review decision was that the evidence adduced by the Appellant did not demonstrate the actual amounts paid for the goods imported as required under Section 122 of EACCMA.63.In particular, the Tribunal has noted that the Respondent in its review decision stated in part as follows;“…It was your submission in paragraph 2 and 3 that, there were some payments which do not relate to importation of goods. The Bank remittances were sent to your representative as indicated above reconciled and remarked with supplier’s name and indicated as imports (see annexure marked A). in your objection a contrary opinion was provided on some of the remittances marked as imports, this is not only misleading but misrepresentation of facts to the Commissioner. Be it as it may, the Commissioner has adjusted the payments in relation to your averments and your bank reconciliation.From the reconciled USD Guardian Bank account for both 2021 to 2022 it was noted that you only accounted for 46 entries out of 67 and 36 entries out of 72 respectively leaving other entries unaccounted for. The entries and CIF for 2021 and 2022 were forwarded to your email address on 27thMarch 2023 for reconciliation. It would therefore be expected of you to merge and account for the entries and remittances to your supplier for the years under audit.From the onset of this audit the issue under contention is undervaluation of imported goods for the years 2021 and 2022. Having gone through the USD and Kshs. Guardian Bank for the years 2021 and 2022 the variance between CIF and bank remittances depict undervaluation. Extra taxes calculated on the variance as follows.…”64.From the above extract of the Respondent decision and pleadings, the Appellant had failed to reconcile and account for 82 out of 139 import entries that were under audit after the Respondent had requested it do the same. Although the Appellant had averred that it had prepared a comprehensive defence and fully discharged its burden in proving that the demand should not stand, it did not directly address this specific issue of entries not accounted for in its pleadings. The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent made adjustment to the final assessment in the review decision where the payments had been clarified in the bank reconciliation by the Appellant.65.The Tribunal is guided by Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actin determining the party that bears the burden of proof under this particular circumstance. The Section provides as follows:-“In a proceeding before the Tribunal the Appellant has the burden of proving;a)Where an appeal relates to an assessment that the assessment is excessive; orb)In any other case that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”66.Further, Section 235(1) of EACCMA provides as follows regarding production of documents;“The proper officer may, within five years of the date of importation, exportation or transfer or manufacture of any goods, require the owner of the goods or any person who is in possession of any documents relating to the goods —(a)to produce all books, records and documents relating in any way to the goods; and(b)to answer any question in relation to the goods; and(c)to make declaration with respect to the weight, number, measure, strength, value, cost, selling price, origin, destination or place of transhipment of the goods, as the proper officer may deem fit.”67.In this particular Appeal the Appellant had the burden to discharge in demonstrating to the Tribunal that it indeed provided verifiable information and documents to the Respondent at the objection stage that would have proved that the assessment was excessive or the decision should have been made differently. From the foregoing analysis the information and documents presented by the Appellant did not address the specific issues raised by the Respondent in the review decision and therefore has failed to discharge this burden.68.The Tribunal reiterates the finding by the High Court wherein it agreed with the conclusion of the Tribunal inCommissioner of Domestic Taxes v Trical and Hard Limited (Tax Appeal E146 of 2020) [2022] KEHC 9927 (KLR) (Commercial and Tax) when it stated as thus;“A presumption of correctness arises from the Commissioner’s determination/assessment. The presumption remains until the taxpayer produces competent and relevant evidence to support his/her position.…”69.In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant did not discharge the burden of proof placed on it and consequently the Respondent’s decision was justified.Final Decision70.In view of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal finds that the Appeal lacks merit and accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Respondent’s review decision dated 16thJune, 2023 is hereby upheld.c.Each Party to bear its own costs.71.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -  CHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

      [2024] KEELRC 2182 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Employment and Labour Relations Court at NairobiAppeal E239 of 2023NJ Abuodha, JSeptember 6, 2024BetweenFlashcom Security LimitedAppellantandMoses Muyera MalikaRespondent(Being an appeal from the judgment and decree of Hon. HOSEA MWANGI NGANGA (PM) issued in Milimani Commercial Courts Court Employment Cause No. E1951 of 2021 between Moses Muyera Malika vs Flashcom Security Limited delivered on 19th October, 2023)Judgment1.Through the Memorandum of Appeal dated 17thNovember, 2023, the Appellant appealed against part of the Judgment of Hon. Hosea Mwangi Nganga (P.M) delivered on 19thOctober, 2023 in Milimani Chief Magistrates Court Employment Cause No. E1951 of 2021 between Moses Muyera Malika vs Flashcom Security Limited.2.The Appeal was based on the grounds that:a.The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding the Respondent one-month salary in lieu of notice.b.The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to give due regard to the Appellants pleadings, evidence and submissions placed on record and thereby arrived at an erroneous decision in awarding the claim for underpayment.c.The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding the Respondent his claim for public holidays without the Respondent producing any supporting evidence.d.The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding the Respondent maximum compensation all circumstances considered.3.The Appellant prayed that the appeal be allowed and the Judgment of the trial court of 19thOctober,2023 in relation to awards of compensation, salary in lieu of notice, underpayment and public holidays be aside with costs of this appeal being awarded to the Appellant.4.The Appeal was disposed of by written submissions.Appellant’s Submissions5.The Appellant filed written submissions dated 5thFebruary, 2024 and on the issue of award of maximum compensation of the sum of Kshs 208,958.88 equivalent to 12 months the Appellant submitted that consideration should be given to the period served by the Respondent. That the Respondent had worked for 15 months with about three months remaining for his contract and taking in to account that the Appellant had paid the Respondent his terminal dues including accrued salary since he was not entitled to leave pay then compensation payable to the Respondent should not exceed three months salary.6.The Appellant relied on the case of CMC Aviation Limited vs Mohammed Noor (2015) eKLR where the court awarded one month compensation. That the Respondent did not prove that he experienced difficulty in securing alternate employment for himself to be awarded maximum compensation or prove the extent of the damage caused by his dismissal. The Appellant prayed that the award of 12 months compensation be substituted with 3 months compensation.7.On the issue of underpayments in the sum of Kshs 129,198.63 the Appellant submitted that the trial court failed to evaluate the terms and conditions of service with respect to the instrument of engagement which were contracts of employment. That the validity of the contracts of employment were undisputed by the Respondent at trial. The Appellant prayed that this court reexamines their supporting evidence and set aside the award of underpayments.8.On the issue of Public Holidays in the sum of Kshs 24,702.70 the Appellant submitted that the Respondent did not lead any evidence at trial to support his claim for remedies sought under this head. The Appellant relied on the case of BWK V EK &Another (2017) eKlr in support of this issue.9.The Appellant further submitted that the Respondent in his submissions at trial court claimed 15 Public holidays but the trial court erroneously awarded him 17 days albeit without any documentary evidence in support of the Claim. That the Respondent never raised the issue of public holiday compensation during his employment but brought it up in the claim hence an afterthought. That the trial court erred by awarding the public holidays because of its failure to provide employment records. The Appellant relied on the case of Jacob OsoroManyinsa v Lavington Security Limited (Civil Appeal 55 of 2019) (2023) KECA 1376(KLR) on the standard of proof. That court should set aside the award of public holiday compensation for lack of proof.Respondent’s Submisssions10.The Respondent filed his submissions dated 25thApril, 2024 and on the issue of his maximum compensation he relied on section 49(1)(c) and 4 of theEmployment Actand submitted that the aspects of section 49(4) were considered by the trial court. The Respondent relied on the case ofGas Kenya Limited v Odhiambo(Appeal E506 of 2022)KEELRC 3930(KLR) 22 September 2022) (Judgment) on justifications of 12 months compensation by trial court. That the award of 12 months salary as compensation was justified and should not be interfered with.11.On the issue of underpayments to the sum of Kshs 129,198.03 the Respondent submitted that he was employed by the Appellant on 22/2/2020 as a night security guard on a monthly salary of Kshs 8,800 where he worked for 15 months. That he was never paid house allowance and or accommodation by the Respondent. That his gross salary as per the Regulation of Wages (General) Amendment Order 2018 in Nairobi was supposed to be paid Kshs. 17,413.24.12.It was the Respondent’s submissions that the salary of Kshs 8,800/= was based on the contract of employment which contract was subservient to the express provisions of the law. That the award of Kshs 129,198.63 should not be disturbed.13.On the issue of Public Holidays in the sum of Kshs 24,702.70 the Respondent submitted that the court was right in awarding him the award under this head. That in his claim he stated that he worked on public holidays as well as in his testimony in court he proved the same. He relied on the case ofBwire v Wasso Security Limited (Cause 335 of 2017) 2024 KEELRC 714(KLR) where court awarded such a claim where there were no employment records.14.It was the Respondent’s submissions that he was terminated on 31.5.2021 and only signed prepared clearance forms and were not in any way discharge vouchers. That the payment of salary of May 2021 was contingent on his signing of clearance form. That there was an element of coercion and undue influence. That the signing of clearance form did not discharge the Appellant from the legal burden of paying him his full and lawful terminal dues. That the Appeal was therefore not merited and should be dismissed.Analysis & determination15.This court has considered the pleadings by both parties and the submissions by the parties and this being a first Appeal the court will proceed to reanalyze the evidence before it as was held in the case of Selle vs Associated Motor Boat Company Limited [1968] E.A 123 thus:-An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities……..or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”16.In this case, the Judgment of the trial court was that:a.A declaration be and is hereby issued that the dismissal of the Claimant by the Respondent was unfair and unlawful.b.The Claimant is awarded terminal dues in the sum of Kshs 371,660.21c.Costs and interests at court rates from the date of judgment.17.From the pleadings and proceedings herein, this court notes that the Appellant did not have an issue with the finding of the unfairness of the Respondent’s employment but had an issue with the awards the Respondent was awarded by the trial court. This court has come up with one main issue That is whether this court should interfere with the trial court’s discretion on statutory awards as well as compensation for unfair termination.18.This court as an appellate court can only interfere with the discretion of the lower Court to make an award if there was in the exercise of such discretion leading to erroneous decision as was held on the case of Kenya Revenue Authority & 2 others v Darasa Investments Limited (2018) eKLR where the court held;The court ought not to interfere with the exercise of discretion unless it is satisfied that the Judge misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision, or that it be manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of discretion and occasioned injustice.19.This court will therefore disturb the awards herein if it is proved that the trial court misdirected itself in some matter hence arriving at a wrong decision. This court notes that the parties never submitted on one-month salary in lieu of notice although it was one of the grounds of Appeal. This court takes it as an admission that the Respondent was entitled to the same upon the unfair termination. Upon finding that the Respondent was unfairly terminated without notice or payment in lieu of notice the Respondent was entitled to the same under Section 36 of theEmployment Act.20.On the award of 12 month’s salary as compensation, the court notes that this award though discretionary, the court should be guided by considerations set out under Section 49(4) of theEmployment Actin awarding the damages herein. The Appellant was aggrieved by the lower court discretion to award the Respondent maximum compensation yet he had worked for only 15 months; he was on a contract which had a remainder of three months hence proposed a maximum of three months. The Appellant also alleged that the Respondent had been paid his accrued salary of May,2021.21.The trial court while awarding the maximum compensation gave the reason that the Appellant did not prove that the Respondent was the author of his own misfortune in that he orchestrated the strike. The court takes into consideration the 15 Months period the Respondent worked with the Appellant and the fact that his contract had only three months to end. This court also notes that in as much as the Respondent was unfairly terminated the trial magistrate ought to take in to account the considerations outlined under section 49(4) of theEmployment Act. In this case in any event after three months the employer-employee relationship was to come to an end unless renewed.22.The Court of Appeal in Kenya Broad casting Corporation v Geofrey Wakio(2019) eKLR held that;(22)This Court has established the rule that an award of the maximum 12 months’ pay must be based on sound judicial principles. In Ol Pejeta Ranching Limited vs. David Wanjau Muhoro [2017] eKLR this Court categorically stated that the trial Judge must justify or explain why a claimant is entitled to the maximum award; that the exercise of discretion must not be capricious or whimsical.23.In this case the trial court ought to have explained that apart from the Respondent being unfairly terminated, why he was entitled to the maximum compensation. This court takes note of the fact that the Respondent was unfairly terminated but also considers the period of 15 months the Respondent had worked with the Appellant that his contract had three months to come to an end and that he could get employment elsewhere and agrees with the Appellant that three months compensation as damages for unfair termination would be justified.24.On the issue of underpayment of 129,198.63, the Appellant faults the trial court for making this award stating that the trial court did not evaluate the terms and conditions of service. On the other hand the Respondent alleges that even though the contract of employment provided for Kshs 8,800/= as his salary it was against the express law which was Regulation of Wages (General) (Amendment) Order 2018. The trial court relied on section 48 of theLabour Institutions Actwhich states that Wages Order constitutes minimum terms which may not be varied by any agreement.25.This court agrees with the trial court on this head and upholds the trial court finding that the Respondent was entitled to the said underpayments since the Minimum wage provided for Kshs 17,413.24 yet he was earning Kshs 8,800/=c.Public Holidays in the sum of Kshs 24,702.7026.Under this head the trial court noted that it was the duty of the Appellant to produce employment records under section 74 of theEmployment Actto prove that the Respondent worked on public holidays. That shift checklist only indicated the off days and leave days taken but did not capture the specific public holidays and did not address whether the Claimant was in fact allowed to take public holidays or in the alternative received compensation for working on the said days.27.The Appellant on the other hand alleged that the Respondent did not lead evidence to support his claim under this head. That the Respondent never complained working on public holidays. That the Respondent in his submission claimed this award for 15 days but the court awarded 17 days. This court notes that the Respondent in his claim claimed 17 days yet in his submissions he claimed 15 days. Even in this court’s submissions he has claimed 15 days not 17 days. This court notes that parties are bound by their pleadings and submissions do not take place of pleadings. In this particular case the Respondent has maintained the 15 days and not 17 claimed in the claim. The trial court ought to have awarded the 15 days public holidays in this case since the Appellant did not lead any evidence to refute the Respondent’s claims under this head.28.In the upshot the Appeal partially succeeds as follows; _a.3 months’ salary as compensation for unfair termination Kshs. 52,239.72/=b.One month salary in lieu of Notice Kshs……… 17,413.24c.Underpayments …………………..Kshs 129,198.63d.Public Holidays ( 15 days) …………………..

      [2024] KEELRC 2181 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Employment and Labour Relations Court at NairobiCause 1421 of 2018NJ Abuodha, JSeptember 6, 2024BetweenTransport Workers Union KenyaClaimantandSifa Imports LimitedRespondentJudgment1.The Claimant a registered trade union filed its statement of claim dated 3rdOctober, 2018 and pleaded inter alia as follows:a.That on or about 7thNovember,2015 the Grievant one Mr. Kennedy K. Nalwa was employed by the Respondent as a Financial Controller/Accountant. That the claim was made to the court in line with section 69(b) of theLabour Relations Actas per certificate of unresolved dispute.b.The Claimant averred that the Grievant’s employment with the Respondent came to an end on 15thJanuary,2018 after his work station (Prime Star Services Station one among many others which the Respondent operates) was taken over by another dealer hence the Grievant was locked out from his place of work which was unfair redundancy.c.The Claimant averred that the Grievant salary at the time he left the Respondent was Kshs 120,000/= per month. That the Respondent had started withholding the Grievant salary for the month of April 2017 without any explanation. That by the end of December 2018 the Grievant unpaid salary arrears totaled to Kshs 775,000/= and as such he had to formally write to the Respondent to request for the payment. That the Respondent did not bother to pay as requested or make a reply and the Grievant referred the matter to the Claimant.d.The Claimant averred that it wrote to the Respondent on 24thJanuary 2018 and forwarded the Grievant claims for payment as required by law. That the Respondent further ignored the Claimant letter and failed to make any response to date. That the Claimant reported a formal dispute to the Ministry of Labour and a conciliator was appointed. That the Conciliator arranged for three conciliation meetings on 09/03/2018, 23/04/2018 and 08/06/2018 which the Respondent declined to attend. That the conciliator then issued a certificate of unresolved dispute to refer the dispute to this court.2.The Claimant in the upshot prayed for the following against the Respondent;a.That, the Hon. Court Awards and Orders the Respondent to pay the Grievant -Mr. Nalwa his employment/severance benefits as hereunder: -i.Pay in lieu of notice-one Month Salary---Kshs 120,000.00ii.Unpaid/withheld monthly salary(s) – April, 2017 to Dwecember,2017 Kshs 775,000.00iii.15 days wages for January,2018-Kshs 60,000.00iv.2 years pending annual leave days@21 days per year-42 days wages x Kshs 4,000/- per day = Kshs 168,000.00v.2 years severance pay @15 days for each complete year of service-30 days wages-Kshs 120,000.00vi.6 months’ salary compensation for unfair redundancy @Kshs 120,000 pm = Kshs 720,000.00vii.Issuance of certificate of service as per section 51 of theLabour Relations Act-2007.Total Claim =Kshs 1,963,000.003.The Respondent despite being served did not enter appearance or file defence hence the matter therefore proceeded as undefended cause and further oral hearing was dispensed with and the matter would be determined based on documents filed.Determination4.The court has reviewed and considered the pleadings by the Claimant and I have has come up with two main issues;Aa. aa.a.Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminatedb.Whether the Claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought.Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminated5.The Claimant averred that the grievant was unfairly terminated on account of unfair redundancy when the Prime Star Service One was taken over by another dealer. The court notes that in cases of redundancy, section 40 of theEmployment Acthas to be followed. It may be true that the Respondent might have had financial difficulties hence failed to pay the grievant his salary arrears however due process ought to have been followed. The Court is therefore of the view that the redundancy was unfair besides the Respondent did not participate in the proceedings to dispute the grievant’s allegations.WhethrWWhwrWhether the Claimant is entitled to reliefs sought.6.The court having found that the grievant was unfairly terminated compensation follows as a matter of course. The grievant had worked for the respondent for approximately two years hence an award of three months’ salary would be reasonable compensation in the circumstances.7.Severance pay will also be pegged on the two years served and assessed at the rate of 15 days’ pay for each complete year of service. The claimant’s pleaded salary was Kshs. 120,000/- per month hence the severance pay for the period will be Kshs. 60,000/- . The claimant is further entitled to one month’s pay in lieu of notice.8.The prayer for unpaid salary of Kshs 775,000/= as well as 15 days Salary for January 2018 also succeeds.9.On the prayer for leave days since the Respondent who has the burden to proof that the grievant did take his leave never participated in the proceedings herein the same is granted as prayed at Kshs 168,000/=10.The Grievant is entitled to certificate of service under section 51 of theEmployment Actand the same should be issued in 30 days after delivery of this judgment.11.In conclusion the Claimant’s claim is hereby allowed with costs as follows:a.Notice Pay……Kshs 120,000/=b.Unpaid/withheld monthly salary(s) -April 2017 to December 2017 ………Kshs 775,000/=c.15 days wages for January 2018 …….Kshs 60,000/=d.Unpaid Leave……………..Kshs 168,000/=e.Severance pay……….…Kshs 60,000/=f.Three months compensation for unfair termination……………………..Kshs 360,000/=Total…………………..

Mayaka, RO Oluoch, T Vikiru & AK Kiprotich, MembersAugust 23, 2024BetweenPejom Contractors LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentRuling1.The Appellant vide an application dated 14thday of June, 2024 and filed on the 18thday of June, 2024 and which is supported by an Affidavit sworn by Peterson Njomo, a Director of the Appellant, on the 14thday of June, 2024 sought for the following Orders:-a.Spent.b.Spent.c.That this Honourable Tribunal lifts the agency notice placed on the Appellant’s bank account held at Equity Bank.d.That the Appellant be granted leave to file an appeal out of time against the Respondent’s demand notices dated 11thNovember, 2021 and 23rdNovember, 2021.e.That the annexed Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal, Statement of Facts and other accompanying documents be deemed as duly filed and served.f.That pending the hearing and determination of the substantive appeal and any other application filed by the Appellant, the Respondent, its agents or officers be barred from accessing, interfering and/or withdrawing funds and/or issuing agency notices against the Appellant.g.That costs of this application be in the cause.2.The application is premised on the following grounds:-a.That the Appellant is a resident taxpayer based in Nairobi County.b.That the prescribed statutory time to lodge the Appeal with the Tribunal has expired.c.That the Appellant received two demand notices dated 11thNovember, 2021 and 23rdNovember, 2021, respectively, from the Respondent.d.That there was no assessment done on the Appellant or any notice of assessment issued or sent to the Appellant by the Respondent prior to issuance of the demand notices.e.That the tax decision was served upon the Appellant by the Respondent outside the statutory deadlines hence preventing it from filing an appeal within the time allowed by law and thus denying it an opportunity to be heard.f.That the Appellant is not in any way indebted to the Respondent as per the tax decision it arrived at.g.That if this application is not allowed, the Appellant will suffer irreparable loss on account of a mistake by the Respondent and no mistake by the Appellant, as the taxes being demanded are excessive, erroneous and the intended appeal is merited.h.That the delay in filing this Appeal is not inordinate in these circumstances.i.That if this application is allowed, the Respondent will not suffer any loss as in the event it is determined that taxes are due, the Appellant will pay interest for the continued non-payment of taxes.j.That the application will not prejudice the Respondent in any way but will provide an opportunity to this Honourable Tribunal to decide the issues on merit and ensure dispensation of justice.Analysis and Findings3.When the application came up for hearing on the 27thJune, 2024 the Tribunal directed the Respondent to file and serve its response to the application by the 3rdJuly, 2024 and the parties were to file and serve upon each other their respective written submissions by the 14thJuly, 2024.4.The Respondent did not file any response to the application and the application is to that extent deemed as unopposed.5.None of the parties filed any written submissions and the Tribunal has in the circumstances been prompted to make a determination of the application strictly on the premise of the grounds on the face of the application and the facts as disclosed in the Affidavit in support of the application.6.The Tribunal’s jurisdiction for the enlargement of time in the commencement of an appeal process is found under Section 13(2) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actwhich provides as thus:-“(3)The Tribunal may, upon application in writing, extend the time for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).(4)An extension under subsection (3) may be granted owing to absence from Kenya, or sickness, or other reasonable cause that may have prevented the applicant from giving notice of appeal within the specified period.”7.The Tribunal is enjoined to determine the length and reason for the delay when considering an application for the extension of time to appeal out of time. The power to extend is discretionary and unfettered but the same must be exercised judiciously.8.In determining whether to extend time, the Tribunal was guided by the court in Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR, where the learned Judge quoted Sir Thomas Bingham M R in Costellow v Somerset County Council [1993]1 All ER 952 where he stated that:-“The first principle is that the rules of court and the associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote expeditious dispatch of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of a procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate…. Further, an extension of time is an indulgence from the court by a party in default. He is not entitled to an extension. He has no reasonable or legitimate expectation of receiving one. His only reasonable or legitimate expectation is that the discretion relevant to his application to extend time will be exercised judicially in accordance with established principles of what is fair and reasonable. In those circumstances, it is incumbent on the applicant for an extension of time to provide the court with a full, honest and acceptable explanation of the reasons for the delay. He cannot reasonably expect the discretion to be exercised in his favour, as a defaulter, unless he provides an explanation for the default.”9.On the criteria of the issues to be considered when granting an extension to file an appeal out of time, the Tribunal referred to the case of Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591 where the Court laid a hierarchy of factors to consider when it stated that:-“an applicant must now show, in descending scale of importance, the following factors: - a) That there is merit in his appeal. b) That the extension of time to institute and/or file the appeal will not cause undue prejudice to the respondent; and c) That the delay has not been inordinate.”10.The Tribunal, guided by the principles set out in Wasike v Swala [1984] KLR 591, Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR and Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 used the following criteria to consider the application.a.Whether the appeal is merited.b.Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay.c.Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted.a. Whether the appeal is merited.11.The Tribunal examined whether the actions complained of by the Applicant were merited and whether there was an arguable appeal before the Tribunal or the appeal was frivolous to the extent that it would only result in a waste of the Tribunal’s time.12.An appeal being merited does not mean that it should necessarily succeed but rather it is arguable. The Tribunal was guided by the findings of the court in Kenya Commercial Bank Limited v Nicholas Ombija [2009] eKLR where it was held that:-“an arguable appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court.”13.The Tribunal has noted from both the application and the Notice of Appeal filed on the 18thJune, 2024 that the Appellant intends to appeal as against the demand notices issued by the Respondent on the 11thand 23rdNovember, 2021.14.The demand notices issued constitute tax decisions and any party dissatisfied with a tax decision ought to invoke the provision of Section 51 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actin challenging such a tax decision. The relevant parts of the Section provides as follows:-“(1) A taxpayer who wishes to dispute a tax decision shall first lodge an objection against that tax decision under this section before proceeding under any other law.(2)A taxpayer who disputes a tax decision may lodge a notice of objection to the decision, in writing with the Commissioner within thirty days of being notified of the decision.”15.The Appellant has admittedly not lodged any objections on the basis that it was not served with any notices of tax assessments prior to its being issued with the demand notices in issue.16.It is manifestly clear that the Appellant did not attempt to exhaust the mechanisms provided under Section 51 of theTax Procedures Actprior to attempting to invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. To this extent the taxes demanded crystallized for recovery on the part of the Respondent and thus the Respondent appropriately exercised its statutory mandate in the issuance of the Agency notices against the Appellant’s banker in enforcement of payment of the taxes.17.The need to adhere to statutory edicts was aptly emphasized in the case of W.E.C Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No.247 of 2020] where it was held at Paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”18.The Appellant having failed to adhere to the provisions of Section 51 of theTax Procedures Actthere is no conceivably sustainable appeal that can be pursued by the Appellant before this Tribunal.19.The Tribunal in the circumstances finds that there is no proper and competent appeal that can be filed for determination on its merits.20.The Tribunal having made the foregoing finding of absence of a competent Appeal that is capable of being pursued by the Appellant before the Tribunal finds that the other factors for consideration have since been rendered moot.21.Following the foregoing finding that the Appellant has no appeal capable of being pursued the Tribunal hereby finds that the Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents simultaneously filed with the application were premature, incompetent and unsustainable in law.Disposition22.On the basis of the foregoing analysis the application lacks merit and the Appeal filed therewith is invalid and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:-a.The application be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.c.No orders as to costs.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RD DAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

      [2024] KEELRC 2180 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Employment and Labour Relations Court at NairobiAppeal 65 of 2023NJ Abuodha, JSeptember 6, 2024BetweenDPL Festive LimitedAppellantandJoseph Muthiani KiioRespondentJudgment1.Through the Memorandum of Appeal dated 12thApril, 2017, the Appellant appeals against the Judgment of Hon. I. Orenge (Mr.) delivered on 22ndSeptember, 2017 in Milimani Chief Magistrates Court Civil Case No. 632 of 2013.2.The Appeal was based on the grounds that:i.The Learned Magistrate erred in fact and law by disregarding the Authorities of the Appellant which stipulate the rationale for arriving at the appropriate quantum of damages.ii.The Learned Magistrate erred in fact and law awarding exorbitant and excessive quantum of damages not based on any authority.iii.The Learned Magistrate erred in fact and law by holding the Appellant liable for the injuries occasioned to the Respondent herein.iv.The Learned Magistrate erred in fact and law by disregarding the authorities of the Appellant stipulating the rational for arriving at the appropriate decision on liability.3.The Appellant prayed that the appeal be allowed and the Judgment and decree of the Chief Magistrates Court Civil Case No. 632 of 2013 be set aside with costs.4.The Appeal was disposed of by written submissions.Appellants’ Submissions5.The Appellant filed written submissions dated 14thOctober, 2022 and submitted on the duty of the appellate court while relying on the case of Mbogo v Shah 91968) EA 93 and Peter Kanithi Kimunya v Aden Guyo Haro(2014) eKLR.6.On the issue of whether the trial court erred in finding the Appellant to be 100% liable for the accident, the appellant submitted on burden of proof under sections 107 and 108 of theEvidence Act. The Respondent blamed the Appellant for injuries sustained at workplace on the basis that the Appellant failed to take adequate precautions for the safety of the Respondent. That on the day of the accident he was assigned duties of offloading wheat bags and arranging them in the store when suddenly the bags fell on him from a height and he sustained injuries.7.The Appellant submitted that even though the Respondent started working with the Appellant from 2006 he had nothing to show for it as he was a casual laborer. The Appellant relied on the Black’s Law Dictionary and the case of Blyth v Birmingham Company [1856] 11 Exch on definition of negligence and submitted that the Respondent ought to have proved the elements of negligence which were the duty of care, breach of that duty of care, the result of which the Respondent suffered loss and damage. The appellant relied on the case of Nandwa v Kenya Kazi Ltd[1988] eKLR on the same.8.The Appellant submitted that even though an employer has a duty to ensure safety of employees that duty was not absolute. The appellant relied in support on the case of Eastern Produce (K) Limited v Allan Okisai Wasike(2014) eKLR. The Appellant submitted that the Respondent was fully aware of the dangers he faced hence the author of his own misfortunes. According to the appellant, the Respondent had been doing the same job for four years yet he was never injured. He had the necessary skill, Knowledge and expertise to do the job and avoid any foreseeable danger.9.The Appellant submitted that no evidence was led to show that any thing changed on that particular day or any omission to led to the accident. The Respondent never complained to the Appellant or his supervisor of unsafe working conditions for those four years. That even though the Appellant did not have witnesses to controvert the Respondent’s allegations the trial court’s award of 100% liability was against the standard of proof in civil cases which was on a balance of probabilities.10.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent had a duty to show the causal link between the injury he sustained and the Appellant’s negligence. That the Appellant raised contributory negligence based on the Respondent’s knowledge of the dangers of being a casual laborer if caution is thrown to the wind. That the Respondent never gave explanation of any precaution he took to ensure or minimize the occurrence of the accident having worked for 4 years. The Appellant relied on among other cases the case of Barrack Ofulo Otieno v Instarect Limited [2017]eKLR.11.The Appellant submitted that the Respondent was equally to blame for the injuries sustained. That he bore greater responsibility of ensuring that he averted the danger. The Appellant proposed the liability to be 20:80 as against the Appellant to the Respondent.12.On the issue of whether the award of Kshs 700,000/= was inordinately high the Appellant submitted that the Respondent suffered dislocation of the left knee joint, blunt chest injury with a bruise, blunt injury to the left shoulder and bruise on the left ankle. That according to Dr. Cyprianus Okoth’s medical report it was his opinion that the injuries sustained by the Respondent could be classified as grievous harm. That the knee joint may develop an osteoarthritis in future.13.The Appellant submitted that according to the medical report by Dr. Madhiwala it was his opinion that the Respondent suffered from injuries indicated which had healed well and left no permanent disability. That temporary disability was for two weeks since the Respondent was examined by Dr. Okoth a month after the accident while Dr. Madhiwala three years after the accident when the Respondent had completely healed.14.The Appellant on the case of Kemfro Africa Limited t/a Meru Express Service, Gathogo Kanini vs A.M Lubia and Olive Lubia(1982-88) IKAR 727 & another on the circumstances  when the appellate court would interfere if the award is inordinately high. The Appellant therefore submitted that the cases relied upon by the Respondent, the injuries were severe hence against the principle of comparable injuries to attract comparable awards. That the cases relied on by the Appellant were more probable in guiding the trial court in determining the awardable damages even if the Respondent’s injuries were classified as grievous harm by Dr. Okoth.15.The Appellant submitted that the trial court gave inordinately high award and this court should reassess the same while being guided by the case of Carolyne Indasi Mwanyonyo v Kenya Bus Service Ltd Civil Appeal No. 17 of 2007 [2012] eKLR where court awarded Kshs 350,000/= for soft tissue injuries and dislocation of knee joint.16.The Appellant also proposed the case of Mara Tea Factoy Limited v Joshua Makworo Onkoba (2021) eKLR where an award of Kshs 300,000/= for head injury with cut wound on the temporal region and optical area, tenderness of ribs on palpation, bruises on the knees, dislocation on the right hip joint and right knee. The Appellant proposed damages at Kshs 280,000/= less the 80% contribution as adequate compensation to the Respondent which would be in total Kshs 283,000/= with special damages and the awardable amount to the Respondent total to be Kshs 590,000/=Respondent’s Submissions17.The Respondent filed his written submissions dated 27thMay,2023 and submitted that he was injured while working for the Appellant. That it was confirmed that the Appellant never provided him with protective equipment. That the Appellant did not call any witnesses to controvert his evidence nor produce any record of providing him with protective equipment nor the accident register.18.On the issue of whether the trial Magistrate award of damages was high the Respondent submitted that the trial magistrate considered the injuries sustained by the respondent and awarded a reasonable figure. That the report of DR. Okere confirmed his injuries. That the trial magistrate was right in holding the Appellant 100% liable for the accident since the Appellant did not provide a record on providing him with protective equipments. The Respondent relied on the case of Overseas Tankship Ltd v Morts Dock Ltd[1967] 1 AC 617.19.The Respondent submitted that he got injured while working on the Appellant’s premises and relied on Halsbury’s law of England 4thEdition Vol 16 and case ofMakala Maku Mumende v Nyali Golf & Country Club ca No.16 of 1989on the duty of care by the employer. He submitted that the appeal lacked merit, should be dismissed and the judgment enhanced to Kshs 1.5 Million.Analysis & determination20.This court has considered the pleadings by both parties and the submissions and this being a first Appeal, the court will proceed to reanalyze the evidence before it as was held in the case of Selle vs Associated Motor Boat Company Limited [1968] E.A 123 thus:-An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities……..or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”21.In this case, the Judgment of the trial court was that;I find the Defendant 100% to blame for the accident. I award the Plaintiff Kshs 700,000/= for general damages and Kshs 3,000/= as special damages pleaded plus costs and interests at court rates.""22.The Appellant was aggrieved with the 100% liability on its part and the award of quantum of damages awarded to the Respondent of Kshs 700,000/= as general damages which he felt was inordinately high. The main issues in this Appeal are therefore;a.Whether the trial magistrate erred in finding the Appellant 100% liable for the accident.b.Whether trial magistrate’s award of Kshs 700,000/= as general damages to the Respondent was inordinately high.Whether the trial magistrate erred in finding the Appellant 100% liable for the Accident.23.This court notes that in as much as the Appellant alleges that the Respondent had nothing to show that he was its employee it has also admitted that the Respondent had worked for 4 years hence it can not deny him as his employee. It is also not disputed that on the date of accident the Respondent was assigned offloading and arranging wheat bags at the Appellant’s store when the bags fell from a height and injured the Respondent. This court also notes that the Respondent had worked for the Appellant for four years hence had the required expertise and experience to avoid any danger.24.The court agrees with the lower court that the Respondent did not call witnesses to controvert the Respondent’s evidence. No evidence was tendered to show that the appellant provided the Respondent with protective gear. The Appellant as the Respondent’s employer had a duty of care to provide a safe working environment for the Respondent. Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4thedition volume 15 at paragraph 560:-“At common law an employer is under a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of his employees in all the circumstances so as not to expose them to an unnecessary risk.25.In the case ofSegwic Kenya Insurance Brokers –vs- Price Water House Coopers Kenya HCCA No. 720 of 2006Lesiit, J cited the case of Capro Industries Ltd Plc v Dickman & Others [1990] 1 All ER, 658,where the House of Lords held thus;“The three criteria for the imposition of a duty of care were foreseeability of damage, proximity of relationship and reasonableness or otherwise of imposing a duty of care. In determining whether there was a relationship of proximity between the parties the court, guided by situations in which the existence, scope and limits of a duty of care had previously been held to exist rather than by a single general principle, would determine whether the particular damage suffered is the kind of damage which the defendant was under a duty to prevent and whether there were circumstances from which the court could pragmatically conclude that a duty of care existed.”26.In this particular case the Respondent alleged that the Appellant did not provide protective gear. This court is therefore tasked with the question whether if the Respondent was provided with the protective gears would it stop the accident or him from being injured. The answer to this question is that the protective gear could not stop the bags from falling or prevent the Respondent from sustaining the nature of the injuries sustained by the Respondent. The question therefore was what the Appellant supposed to do to prevent the accident when the Respondent was the one to offload and arrange the bags of wheat. Taking in to account his experience of four years working with the Appellant on the same work of offloading and arranging bags the Respondent had the necessary expertise, experience and knowledge to avoid such danger. The Respondent did not lead any evidence on the change of the work he was assigned to do. He never raised any issue of the working environment being unsafe for the four years he worked for the Appellant. He never produced any evidence of reporting to the management of any challenges with his working environment.27.Whereas the larger responsibility lies on the employer to provide a safe working environment, the employee also has some measure of responsibility to ensure their own safety. As observed earlier, the respondent had worked for the appellant for approximately four years. He must have therefore acquired the necessary experience in the work he was doing and aware of the potential dangers that could arise in the course of the performance of his work. The Respondent who was arranging the bags ought to have known that when they were wrongly arranged there was danger of falling. He ought therefore to have been careful while carrying out his work. Some measure of liability for the accident ought therefore to have been apportioned to the respondent and this Court apportions 10% contributory negligence.Whether trial magistrate’s award of Kshs 700,000/= as general damages to the Respondent was inordinately high.28.Whereas the trial court acted within its discretion to award the said damages which are discretionary in nature; this court as an appellate court will proceed carefully so as not to interfere with such trial Court’s discretion unless certain conditions are satisfied as was held in the case of Gitobu Imanyara & 2 Others v Attorney General[2016] eKLR. The Court of Appeal held as follows:-It is firmly established that this Court will be disinclined to disturb the finding of a trial Judge as to the amount of damages merely because they think that if they had tried the case in the first instance they would have given a larger sum. In order to justify reversing the trial Judge on the question of the amount of damages it will generally be necessary that this Court should be convinced either that the Judge acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that the amount awarded was so extremely high or so very low as to make it, in the judgment of this Court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled. This is the principle enunciated in Rook v Rairrie [1941] 1 ALL E.R. 297. It was echoed with approval by this Court in Butt v. Khan [1981] KLR 349 when it held as per Law, J.A that:“An appellate court will not disturb an award of damages unless it is so inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate. It must be shown that the Judge proceeded on wrong principles, or that he misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low.”29.In this case the court is called upon to illustrate if the trial court proceeded on wrong principle, the amount excessively high or if the award was an erroneous estimate. The Appellant has submitted that the trial magistrate considered cases where the Plaintiff sustained serious injuries than those sustained by the Respondent herein and therefore arrived at a wrong figure.30.The nature of the Respondent’s injuries were dislocation of the left knee joint, blunt chest injury with a bruise, blunt injury to the left shoulder and bruise on the left ankle. These injuries conform with the Dr. Cyprianus Okoth medical report who classified the injuries as grievous harm. The Report which was conducted one month after the accident indicated that the Respondent complained of pain on the left knee, chest pains and lower backaches.31.The Appellant’s medical report conducted by Dr. Ashwin Madhiwala three years after the accident confirmed that the Respondent sustained dislocation of the left knee and soft tissue injury over the chest. The Report confirmed that the Respondent had well healed with no permanent disability. The report indicated that the Respondent still complained of pain on the left knee.32.The cases relied upon by the trial magistrate the injuries ranged from fracture dislocation of both hips, fracture of pelvis, blunt injury to the left shoulder among others. The court also takes note of the cases given by the Appellant. The Court of Appeal in Simon Taveta v Mercy Mutitu Njeru Civil Appeal No. 26 of 2013 [2014] eKLR restated the principle that damages should be determined by the nature and extent of injuries sustained and comparable awards made in the past.33.The cases relied upon by the trial magistrate seemed to have multiple fracture dislocations and severe injuries. The Respondent herein did not have any degree of permanent disability apart from pain on the left knee. The authorities relied on by the Appellant are close to the injuries suffered by the Respondent herein. The amount proposed by the Appellant is however low compared to the inflation in the market and the cases quoted.34.This court takes note of the case of Carolyne Indasi Mwonyonyo Kenya Bus Service Ltd, H.C.C.A. No. 17 of 2007, where the Plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries and the dislocation of the right knee and was awarded Kshs 350,000/=. In this particular case since the Respondent suffered almost similar injuries and the fact that he still complains of pain at the knee and taking into account inflation the time since the above decision was made, an award of Kshs 500,000/= would be reasonable.35.After giving due consideration to all the authorities cited before the court and also before the trial court, this court finds that the learned trial magistrate awarded a sum that was very much on the higher side. Accordingly, the said award is set aside. This court therefore substitutes it with an award of Kshs 500,000/=.36.The Appeal therefore partially succeeds on the followingOrders.a.Liability 50: 10 as against the appellant.b.General damages Kshs 500,000/= Less 10% -- Kshs 450,000/=c.Special Damages Kshs 3,000/=Total ..Kshs 453,000/=The appeal being partially successful, each party shall bear their own costs.37.It is so orderedDATED AT NAIROBI THIS 6TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 6TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024ABUODHA NELSON JORUMJUDGE",DPL Festive Limited v Kiio (Appeal 65 of 2023) [2024] KEELRC 2180 (KLR) (6 September 2024) (Judgment),Appeal 65 of 2023,"NJ Abuodha, J","September 6, 2024",

Mayaka, RO Oluoch, AK Kiprotich & T Vikiru, MembersAugust 23, 2024BetweenKone Kenya LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Legal Services and Board CoordinationRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant is a fully owned subsidiary of KONE Finland and therefore part of the larger KONE Group. KONE Group is in the business of making and disposal of elevators and escalators around the globe and in countries where it has presence.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, and is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.3.The Respondent issued an assessment on 22ndSeptember, 2022.4.The Appellant objected to the assessment on 21stOctober, 2022.5.The Respondent issued its objection decision on 20thDecember, 2022.6.The Appellant being dissatisfied with the objection decision, lodged the Notice of Appeal dated 17thJanuary, 2023 and filed on 18thJanuary, 2023.The Appeal7.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 2ndFebruary, 2023 and filed on 3rdFebruary, 2023:a.The Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to understand the Appellant's business model, leading to an incorrect and unjustified segmentation of the Appellant's financial statements resulting in an excessive adjustment of its operating profits.b.The Respondent erred in law and in fact by incorrectly deeming the Appellant's third-party sales as controlled sales.c.The Respondent erred in law and in fact by incorrectly assuming that all intercompany purchases of goods only related to sales and installation of new equipment, leaving out the Appellant's service.d.The Respondent erred in law and in fact in assuming that all costs incurred by the Appellant (including finance costs) exclusively related to the sales and installation of new equipment.e.The Respondent erred in law and in fact by incorrectly considering the Appellant's revenue from maintenance and modernization sales as operating profit without taking into account the costs incurred in generating the said revenue.Appellant’s Case8.The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents:a.The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 2ndFebruary, 2023 and filed on 3rdFebruary, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.The Appellant’s witness statement of Ibrahim Sikhule dated 25thSeptember, 2023 and filed on the same date; admitted in evidence under oath on 6thFebruary, 2024.c.The Appellant’s witness statement of Diana Masila dated 25thJanuary, 2024, filed on 26thJanuary, 2024 and admitted in evidence under oath on 6thFebruary, 2024.d.The Appellant’s written submissions dated 20thFebruary, 2024 and filed on the same date together with the authorities attached thereto.9.That between 2014 and 2018 the Appellant was in a start-up phase ramping up the new business operations and the KONE Way operational model. That the KONE Group has a consistent operational model called KONE Way which defines how it implements the strategy fast and in a common way. That its purpose is for the improvement of the customer service experience, employee satisfaction and business performance.10.That the Appellant’s operating profit prepared in accordance with the applicable local accounting standards for the years of income 2016-2021 is reproduced below:KES'000201620172018201920202021*Revenue628,3701,299,829739,8091,511,5141,131,6441,063,749Cost of sales-534,056-1,057,215-527,499-1,154,661-618,832-569,228Gross profit94,314242,614212,310356,853512,812494,521Gross profit%15.0%18.7%28.7%23.6%45.3%46.5%Other income165,276112,393145,864008,332Operating expenses-179,325-240,056-269,924-232,278-371,800-336,700Operating profit80,265114,95188,250124,575141,012166,153Operating profit%12.8%8.8%11.9%8.2%12.5%15.6%11.That there are six main value drivers in the Appellant's business as follows:a)Technology and innovative solutions;b)Global processes/tools/systems;c)Global LIS base and presence;d)Efficient delivery chain;e)Competent and committed personnel; andf)KONE Brand and reputation.12.That KONE Corporation owns the key intellectual property (IP) within the Group and provides its global subsidiaries with access to this IP (e.g. KONE trademarks and technology) as well as certain technical information and other services. That the success of the franchisees, such as that of the Appellant, is among other things also based on the installed base of lifts in service (LIS). That this in turn is a result of KONE Corporation's technology and a strategy of building this base to expand the possibility of generating long term revenues from service and maintenance contracts.13.That the success of the new line of products is largely dependent on the technical specifications and design of the products that are sold to final customers, which is the contribution of KONE Corporation as the developer and owner of the related IP.14.That the Appellant's local sales force performs routine functions and is highly dependent on the bundle of IP, tools and services provided by KONE Corporation at Group level.15.That consequently, the Appellant contributes by expanding the LIS base with the support of KONE Corporation with its competent and committed personnel whereas the other main value drivers are from the contribution of KONE Corporation.16.The Appellant averred that it supported its grounds of appeal as follows:a. The Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to understand the Appellant's business model, therefore arriving at an incorrect and unjustified segmentation of the Appellant's financial statements resulting in the excessive adjustment of its operating profits.17.The Appellant stated that it demonstrated that the Respondent failed to understand its business model, therefore arriving at an incorrect and unjustified segmentation of the Appellant's financial statements resulting in excessive adjustment of its operating profits. That it did this by availing documentation, setting up meetings with the Respondent and even providing support via documentation such as the Transfer Pricing (TP) Policy to enable the Respondent to better understand its business model. That despite this, the Respondent in its assessment has made several unfounded assumptions and it is the Appellant's belief that the Respondent failed to understand its business model which the Appellant clarified.18.That the Appellant regards its business as homogenous and thus splitting the operating income between the new equipment business and the service business is not applicable in the case of KONE. That therefore, the Appellant has only one reporting segment, and it is therefore not possible to provide segregated financial statements for the sale of new equipment and installation and the service sales as requested by the Respondent.19.That details of the Appellant's lines of business as follows:a. New Equipment Sales and Installation20.That the new equipment business (NEB) of the Appellant consists of sales/distribution and installation of new KONE elevators and escalators. That manufacturing as well as related demand and supply planning together with the global sourcing functions are all globally managed and controlled by KONE from Finland. That the Appellant purchases the new equipment mainly from a related party supply line company in China. That the intercompany purchase prices are based on cost plus pricing and supported by benchmarking studies.21.That further, part of the Appellant's front-line entities' distribution activity, is the installation of new elevators and escalators. That in addition to using own work force, part of the installation activity has been outsourced to manage the fluctuations in the new elevator markets and as such, the installation of the equipment can be deemed as a routine function which can also be performed by an external subcontractor.22.That KONE Corporation has developed and maintains comprehensive guidelines and instructions for the installation. That these are all availed to the front-line entities in the global database (EDMS). That furthermore, KONE Corporation arranges training to ensure sufficient competence for the installation work.23.That the Appellant has a harmonized installation process to ensure safety, quality, productivity and customer-centric mindset in installations. That the harmonized installation process also enables the utilization of global tools and solutions provided by KONE Corporation. That Global Installation Management Solutions support productivity and mobility of installation field personnel, by allowing them to manage projects and complete activities away from office, on site. That quality is ensured by guiding employees through daily activities by KONE processes.24.That after installation, the equipment is transferred to first maintenance and after the warranty period, a sales lead for maintenance business is generated in accordance with globally designed processes.b. Maintenance and Modernization25.That the Appellant's servicing activities fall into two major categories: normal preventive maintenance and repair; and ""modernization"", which involves substantial refurbishing, updating of existing installations and replacing of existing installations. That the service contract base, (Lifts in Service, LIS - including escalators), includes both KONE elevators and third-party elevators (equipment installed by the competitors).26.That in the maintenance business, the local field technicians provide the service to the customer. That the Appellant performs the maintenance activities in accordance with the Modular Based Maintenance (MBM) practice developed and patented by KONE Corporation. That MBM is based on eight maintenance modules which have been harmonized in KONE's maintenance operations globally. That the modules are performed systematically and in line with optimized maintenance planning. That the MBM consists of global maintenance manuals, maintenance profiles, target times per module and audit procedures.27.That MBM has resulted in an increase of the quality as well as the productivity of preventative maintenance. That typically, in Kenya each equipment has up to 12 planned maintenance visits in a year according to the MBM.28.That additionally, in 2017, KONE Corporation launched 24/7 Connected Services, which uses Internet of Things platform and other advanced technologies to bring intelligent services to elevators and escalators enabling vast amounts of data from elevator sensors to be monitored, analyzed and displayed in real-time, improving equipment performance, reliability and safety. That when the sensor detects a defect, depending on the urgency, the technician will receive the information from analytics through KONE Field Mobility (KFM) tool developed by KONE Corporation and the service need is included in the agenda of the next maintenance visit in case of a standard service need or in case of more urgent service needs.29.That the information is first sent to Global Technical Help Desk (THD)where the urgency can be verified and from where the service need will be forwarded to the local technician through the KFM tool. That in case the 24/7 analytics determines that immediate action is needed, the service need is automatically directed through a global 24/7 call centre to the local technician on duty. That approximately 20% of the Appellant's LIS is connected to 24/7 enabling more efficient preventive maintenance based on the data collected from the specific equipment.30.That regardless of the preventive maintenance, if the LIS breaks down, the Appellant may be needed to visit the site on ad-hoc basis to perform repair activities and sometimes rescue entrapped passengers. That this is however, a very small part of the maintenance activities and significantly reduced after introduction of the 24/7 Connected services. That repairs are also done on planned basis before the equipment breaks down. That further, spare parts needed in the repairs of KONE elevators are purchased from KONE Supply Line in Finland.31.That training is provided to local personnel by KONE Corporation on KONE processes, products and tools and the Appellant’s employees have full access to any know-how required in their daily work.32.The Appellant stated that service business also includes modernization of the equipment, which ranges from replacing a single modular component to the full replacement of the equipment in an existing building. That sales leads for modernization come often from maintenance personnel and the customer base is normally the same.33.That KONE's full replacement solutions for elevators are designed and manufactured as complete units, which makes installation easy and with minimum disruption. That full replacement is in turn expected to lead to new maintenance offerings. That the Appellant purchases components or in case of full replacement the elevator from KONE Supply Line for modernization purposes. That the components supplied are based on KONE Technology.c. Lifecycle Business34.That the Appellant is also engaged in lifecycle business where it serves its customers by providing solutions throughout the entire lifecycle of a product; beginning from the installation of a new equipment to the maintenance and repair and modernization during their lifecycle and finally the full replacement of the equipment. That for this line of business, the Appellant requires extensive customer relations, including deliveries of new products with long-term maintenance contracts through the use of innovation and technology as made available by KONE Corporation.35.That due to the misunderstanding on the nature of the business of the Appellant, the Respondent has performed a segregation of the income statement of the company and attempted to separate new equipment sales and service sales as separate segments.36.That the Respondent segregated the FY 2016-2021 income statements of the Appellant by:i.adjusting the new equipment operating profit (EBIT) to 11.72% after considering excessive costs for this business; andii.adjusting the service-related EBIT to 100% as follows:KES'000201620172018201920202021*Revenue628,3701,299,829739,8091,511,5141,131,6441,063,749Cost of sales-534,056-1,057,215-527,499-1,154,661-618,832-569,228Gross profit94,314242,614212,310356,853512,812494,521Gross profit%15.0%18.7%28.7%23.6%45.3%46.5%Other income165,276112,393145,864008,332Operating expenses-179,325-240,056-269,924-232,278-371,800-336,700Operating profit80,265114,95188,250124,575141,012166,153Operating profit%12.8%8.8%11.9%8.2%12.5%15.6%The Appellant noted that finance costs should be reported below EBIT as depicted below:Year201820172016(Kshs '000)NEBSEBNEBSEBNEBSEBSales510 940228 8691 110 841188 988461 732166 638Cost of sales527 49901 057 2150534 0560Gross profit-16 559228 86953 626188 988-72 324166 638GP Margin96,65%100%4,83%100%-15,66%100%Other income56 247112 462174 686Operating expenses310 0210240 1250179 3250Finance costs**40 33233 021EBIT-270 333228 869-114 369188 988-109 984166 638EBIT Margin-52,91%100%-10,3%100%-23,82%100%Adjusted EBIT@11.72%59 882130 19154115EBIT on full entity level after proposed adjustment(%)288 751 (39.0%)319 179 (24.6%)220 753 (35.1%)37.That as described above, there are no grounds for the above segregation. That the profitability of the Appellant in 2016-2021 according to local accounting standards and before any audit adjustment is illustrated in the below table:-201620172018201920202021*Operating profit(%)12.8%8.8%11.9%8.2%12.5%15.6%38.The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred in stating that, the arm's length operating profit is in the range of 7.81% to 18.95% with a median of 11.72%. That as can be seen from the above table, the operating profit of the Appellant has varied between 8.2% and 15.6% in the period 2016 to 2021, which is already within the range required by the Respondent in all the years. That thus, there are no legal or other grounds for the adjustment performed by the Respondent as the operating profit of the Appellant has, already prior to any audit adjustment, been within the interquartile range of the benchmark study and thus, at arm's length level.39.That the segregation performed by the Respondent was not necessary since both new equipment sales and service sales are uncontrolled sales although there are controlled purchases of goods from related parties in relation to both businesses. That the Appellant is engaged in lifecycle business where all the business activities are so interconnected that they cannot be evaluated separately and thus form only one common reporting segment.40.That additionally, the segregation performed by the Respondent results in a completely incorrect result whereby the Respondent has considered that the service business would not bear any fixed or operative expenses and thus results in 100% operating profit margin according to the Respondent. That this assumption is clearly erroneous as the Appellant employs maintenance technicians to perform the maintenance, repair and modernization activities, purchases and employs tools and materials for performing the servicing activities, maintains maintenance vehicles, purchases spare parts for these servicing activities and so on.41.That the adjustment performed by the Respondent for the financial years 2016 to 2021 is clearly excessive as it results to operating profit margin varying between 24.6% and 39%. That these margins are clearly above the arm’s length range.42.That during the years 2016 to 2021, the KONE Group operating profit on global level ranged between 11.5% to 14.7%. That the proposed EBIT of 24.6% - 39% for a routine distributor in the Group is clearly excessive and not sustainable. That should the Respondent demand such operating profits in Kenya, the Appellant’s ability to continue business in Kenya would be severely impacted.b. he Respondent erred in law and in fact by incorrectly deeming the Appellant's third-party sales as controlled sales.43.That the Appellant has two core business lines as mentioned in Section 2.1.1 of the Respondent's 21stOctober, 2022 tax assessment as follows:i.The distribution of new equipment, i.e., elevators and escalators, which consists of purchase of the equipment from related party supply line and sale and installation of the equipment to external customers in Kenya; andii.Maintenance and modernization of elevators and escalators including both KONE Kenya and third-party equipment, for which spare parts are purchased from both related party global spare part supply unit as well as third parties.44.That according to the Respondent, only “the latter is an uncontrolled transaction since it is between KONE Kenya and third-party customers”. That this statement is not correct since both businesses include purchases from related parties and sales to third-party customers and thus, both sales of new equipment as well as sales of maintenance and modernization services are uncontrolled transactions. That the intra-group purchases relating to these sales are controlled transactions and the Respondent has not challenged the arm's length nature of these purchases at any point.45.That Paragraph 2 of Chapter 1 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2022 (OECD Guidelines) defines a controlled transaction to mean:“Transactions between two enterprises that are associated enterprises with respect to each other.”46.That from the definition above, the Respondent's classification of the Appellant's sales to entities outside KONE Group is openly in contravention of the OECD Guidelines.47.That the Appellant has further demonstrated that its sales to third parties are in no way influenced by KONE Corporation by demonstrating that:i.It has its own management structure and management team in charge of running day-to-day operations, thereby makes its own commercial decisions such as determining the selling price on sales made to third parties;ii.It maintains its own financial records, bank accounts and separately files its tax returns; andiii.It engages in independent business activities, such as entering into contracts and transactions with third parties, outside the control or direction of the parent company.48.The Appellant averred that its ability to make its own independent decisions when marketing and selling to third parties means that the sale of equipment cannot be deemed as a controlled transaction.49.That the Respondent's basis of categorizing third party sales as controlled transactions is also based on an erroneous assumption that KONE Corporation is able to control the prices to third parties by its subsidiaries through its product pricing tool - KTOC Tool.50.The Appellant clarified that the KTOC tool is provided to the Appellant at Group levels to assist in the pricing. That it is solely the Appellant that decides and inputs the costing elements into the tool such as the labour costs and the cost of locally sourced materials as well as the targeted profit margin levels. That the listed factors mostly influenced by the local market and general business environment inform the Appellant's decisions in pricing and are certainly not external led as incorrectly assumed by the Respondent.51.The Appellant averred that it inputs into the KTOC tool all other price components based on local market situation apart from the transfer price for the finished goods determined in accordance with the arm's length principle by applying cost plus methodology. That the KTOC tool then assists in calculating the recommended price based on the specifications of the order. That the price calculated by the tool is a recommendation for which the Appellant has the discretion to adopt, quote a higher price to the customer or provide a discount without any approvals needed from KONE Corporation.52.That it is only the cost of equipment purchased from related party Supply Lines that that is based on Group level price lists and the pricing of the equipment purchased intra-group is supported by a benchmarking study. The Appellant attached the benchmarking study to demonstrate the Appellant's product pricing for related party transactions. That the Group product pricing does not apply to third party sales by the Appellant.53.That it is not uncommon for routine distributors to determine or negotiate prices with third party customers using pricing guidelines and price lists adopted within the Multi-National Enterprise (MNE) group.54.That based on the above, the Respondent's transfer pricing adjustment is punitive and does not take into account the business model of the Appellant as comprehensively described in the parties’ various correspondences.c. The Respondent erred in law and in fact by incorrectly assuming that all intercompany purchases of goods related to sales and installation of new equipment and none to the service business by the Appellant.55.That the Respondent in making the adjustments made an erroneous assumption that all intercompany purchases of goods related to sales and installation of new equipment and not services.56.That the Respondent has based this assumption on the understanding that the KONE Global Customer Care Centers (KC3) has the capacity to provide emergency services and the Rescue and Repair instructions (AS) without the involvement of the Appellant's employees stationed in Kenya.57.That similarly, the Appellant's customer interface is highly dependent on the bundle of IP, tools and services provided by KONE Corporation.58.The Appellant clarified that the KC3 and AS systems (rescue and repair instructions)are largely dependent on the software intangible developed by KONE Corporation, the absence of which would significantly hamper the Appellant's ability to meet the needs of its customers.59.That from the Appellant's TP policy, the KONE technology, brand, know-how and tools, methods and processes are developed by KONE Corporation. That the provision of services to the customers in Kenya is thus dependent on the seamless interaction between the IP tools provided by KONE Corporation and the local team of technicians.60.That at the same time, KONE Corporation provides training service to the Appellant's personnel on the processes, products and tools. That the Respondent's suggestion that the local emergency teams are able to provide the services without the support from KONE Corporation is therefore unfounded.d. The Respondent erred in law and in fact by failing to appreciate the functions performed by the Appellant, assets employed, or the risks assumed by the Appellant in performing the transactions under review.61.That according to Paragraph 1.34 of the OECD Guidelines, the typical process of identifying the commercial or financial relations between the associated enterprises and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations requires a broad-based understanding of the industry sector in which the MNE group operates (e.g., mining, pharmaceutical, luxury goods) and of the factors affecting the performance of any business operating in that sector.62.That it is the Appellant's view that the functions performed by the Company are those of a routine distributor as described already above. That the assertion by the Respondent that KONE Kenya would perform functions or bear risks that are not common to routine distributors is based on incorrect understanding of KONE Kenya's business. That it is clear that the Respondent has failed to understand the industry in which KONE Kenya operates in when claiming that KONE Kenya would perform functions and assume risks above those of a routine distributor which has led to the incorrect and excessive transfer pricing adjustment.63.That the company assumes limited risks relating to marketing, sales, distribution and maintenance of the products locally. That the company utilizes bundle of IP, solutions, processes and tools developed, owned and provided by KONE Corporation for KONE Kenya to perform its routine distribution and servicing functions in accordance with the KONE Way processes and guidelines. That KONE Kenya does not own any significant intangible property. That KONE Kenya's functional profile is in line with routine distributor functions, risk and asset classification and is summarized on high level below:KONE KenyaOther KONE CompanyFunctionsResearch and DevelopmentN/AKONE Corporation is responsible for R&D activities in the KONE GroupManufacturingN/AKONE Supply Units are responsible for manufacturing products in accordance with the specifications/designs from KONE CorporationMarketing, Sales and DistributionRoutine function taking care of meetings with potential customers, informing the customer of the quality of KONE products and services, and bidding on customer tenders.Support from KONE CorporationEngineeringN/AKONE Corporation is responsible for all engineering activities in the KONE GroupSourcing and Material ManagementLimited local sourcing and material management functionsGlobal Sourcing and Material Management Support from KONE CorporationInstallationKONE Kenya performs installation in accordance with global guidelines and processes.

That the Appellant also controls the inventory levels in accordance with KONE processes, with KONE material management system DBS and regular inventories.65.That the ""non-return point"" referred to by the Respondent in its assessment and objection decision relates to the start of the manufacturing of the ordered product. That all KONE's distribution companies have to respect the ""non return point"", which means that after the production process starts in a manufacturing unit, all the cumulated costs will be invoiced to the distribution company, even in the case of order cancellation. That this is because each elevator sold is an individual product with specific finishes and drawings even in case of a standard elevator. That the products are made to order, and the use of cancelled order for another project is typically not possible.66.That in order to mitigate any cancellations, the start of the manufacturing is mutually agreed between the KONE Supply Line and the Appellant and requires for:i.the customer confirmation and approval of shaft drawings and elevator finishesii.confirmation on shaft and site readiness survey as well asiii.receipt of advance funds from customer in accordance with project payment terms.67.That the external customer is fully aware of its obligations at non-return point. That thus, cancellation risk is equal to none and there are no occasions where the risk would have materialized. That thus, the risk for the Appellant is low and aligned with the functional profile of a routine distributor.68.That as the locally established company, the Appellant acts as the importer of the products to Kenya and complies with related obligations towards the external customer. That further, since typically the equipment is sold installed, the Appellant is also responsible for the installation activities.69.That although the Appellant may be legally responsible towards its customer for product defects as the importer of the products, this does not impact the fact that the Appellant can claim compensation in full, from the KONE supply line in case product liability risk is realized. That thus, as stated by the Appellant in its response to the Respondent, it is the KONE Supply Line which fully bears the product liability risk.70.That from the above, it is clear that the Appellant does not bear any product liability risk as has been assumed by the Respondent in its objection decision.71.That in relation to sales, the Appellant employs a qualified sales team to source for clients while also maintaining a technical team for the installation and maintenance of the machines. That the functions performed by the Appellant's sales team leverage on existent demand in the market for KONE products. That the potential success of new line of products is largely dependent on the technical specifications and design of the products that are sold to final customers. That the engineering team under KONE Corporation holds the necessary level of technical expertise on KONE products and services to be able to serve customers with the right solutions. That the marketing services in respect of KONE's products can be provided by any other marketing firm and are therefore routine.72.That it is therefore the Appellant’s view that the marketing and distribution activities performed by the Appellant are more limited and do not significantly enhance the goodwill or reputation associated with the trademark.e. The Respondent erred in law and fact in disregarding the Appellant's Group Transfer Pricing model and benchmark analysis of the arm's length operating profit level73.That according to the OECD Guidelines, the application of the arm's length principle is based on a comparison of the conditions in a controlled transaction with the conditions that would have been made had the parties been independent and undertaking a comparable transaction under comparable circumstances.74.That in the Appellant's case, the controlled transactions to be tested were the purchases of goods from related parties and payment of the franchise fee and the most appropriate method selected to test the arm's length result of these controlled transactions is the transactional net margin method whereby the operating profit earned by the Appellant in its distribution activity is compared to the operating profits earned by similar independent distribution and servicing companies.75.The Appellant averred that in order to arrive at an arms-length position, it engaged a third-party service provider to perform a comparable company analysis to benchmark the arm's length operating profit return earned by comparable distribution, maintenance and installation companies operating on comparable industries to that of KONE. That it attached the benchmarking analysis used for the period under review to its pleadings.76.That to benchmark the more profitable parts of the business, the comparable study focused on companies primarily involved in the servicing, maintenance and installation functions and thus earning also higher profits compared to traditional buy-sell activities only. That buy-and-sell distribution functions combined with the servicing activities are accepted in comparable companies. That thus, the comparable analysis does consider also the buy-sell activities of KONE Kenya.77.That the global transfer pricing model, which is consistently applied to all KONE routine distribution units such as the Appellant, also ensures that the Company earns at least the arm's length operating profit margin (measured with KONE reporting IFRS figures). That the Appellant attached the global transfer pricing policy to its pleadings.78.That it is on the above basis that KONE Corporation charges the Appellant a franchise fee for the right to use KONE Technology, brand, know-how and tools, methods and processes developed by KONE Corporation based on a Franchise Fee Agreement. That according to the Franchise Fee Agreement, the franchise fee will be calculated under the arm's length principle as a percentage of KONE Kenya's net sales, benchmarked by reference to analogous third-party arrangements. That in 2016-2021, the benchmarked franchise fee rate has been 9.5% of net sales.79.That the Franchise Fee Agreement, however, also states that “the fee in respect of any year shall not exceed such amount as would reduce the operating profit of the front line for that year to an amount below the arm’s length level for the year defined in Schedule 2”. That thus, the operating profit of the Appellant cannot be reduced below 5% based on the Franchise Fee Agreement.80.That the 5% operating profit margin is based on a benchmark study by a third-party professional service provider to verify the arm's length nature of the return earned by the Appellant. That according to the benchmarks (which are regularly updated to ensure up-to-date results), the 5% operating margin is within the arm's length range in 2016-2021.81.That however, in the KONE Global transfer pricing policy there is no mechanism to limit the operating profit margin of the Appellant to only 5% as incorrectly claimed by the Respondent. That the franchise fee rate is thus not increased even if the operating profit of the Appellant would increase above 5% and thus all operating profits earned above the maximum 9.5% franchise fee remain as operating profit of KONE Kenya.82.That from the above, the Respondent had no grounds to disregard the Company's benchmark analysis for the arm's length operating margin.83.That additionally, from the most recent benchmark analysis performed, the aforementioned buy-and-sell distribution companies were also included in the analysis to see whether this would impact the results as the Respondent has claimed, i.e. resulting in higher return for the activities. That the result was that the comparable analysis resulted in a lower arm's length operating profit margin range compared to the earlier analyses where only the servicing and installation activities were considered; an arm's length range of lower quartile 1.59% to upper quartile 6.72%, with a median of 2.72%. That from this perspective it is also safe to assume, that the 5% operating profit margin ensured for the company for the whole distribution activity including the service business has been within the arm's length level.84.That furthermore, the comparable companies included in the benchmark analyses are independent, fully fledged distributors and no comparability adjustments have been performed to the financial information of the comparables to reflect the more limited risk profile of KONE Kenya and thus lower profit expectation, which would be a common practice when benchmarking such limited risk routine operations.85.That thus, the operating margin of 5% supported by the benchmarking analysis already reflects the profit level that an independent fully fledged, integrated distributor would expect to earn. That thus, there was no legal or factual justification for the Respondent to disregard the Appellant's benchmarking analysis.f. The Respondent erred in law and in fact in raising an erroneous tax demand based on its own benchmarking analysis which did not fulfil the independence requirements of a reliable comparable study.86.That the Respondent based its tax adjustments and subsequent assessment on a defective comparable study.87.That from the Appellant’s review, the Respondent's benchmark analysis does not fulfil the independence requirements outlined under Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.1 of the OECD Guidelines for the following reasons:i.The comparability of the functions of most of the companies in the final set was not possible to be confirmed since the companies did not have web pages or any other information available.ii.Some companies included in the final set of the Respondent's comparables were subsidiaries of International Groups of companies and thus not acceptable comparable companies since transfer pricing could have distorted the results of such dependent companies.iii.Some of the companies considered by the Respondent in its benchmarking analysis did not engage in comparable business activities to those of KONE Kenya.iv.The study period of FY2015-19 included in the Respondent's analysis includes data which would not have been available during the years under audit as the external databases typically only have financial data available two years after the end of the financial year in question. That this is contrary to Paragraph 3.74 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines which prohibits the use of that hindsight in transfer pricing analysis.88.That based on the above, the Company is of the view that the benchmark analysis on which the Respondent has based the assessment calculations is not a reliable analysis of the arm's length range of operating profits earned by independent companies engaged in comparable activities in comparable industry as the Appellant.89.That in any case, the Appellant is of the view that the benchmark analysis performed by the Respondent is not necessary since there are no grounds to disregard the Company's analysis anyway.g. The Respondent erred in law and in fact by considering a one-off correction to a long-term loan in the Appellant's financial statements as forex loss.90.The Respondent’s averment in its assessment that the Appellant remains potentially exposed to risks from foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to currency flows from revenue and expenses is not correct.91.That from a review of the Appellant's financial statements, the Respondent has taken an erroneous view that since the Appellant purchases its goods from related parties in foreign currencies but sells its products in Kenya Shillings the Appellant is exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.92.That on the basis of the above assumption the Respondent proceeded to make an adjustment on a long-term loan in the Appellant's financial statements claiming that it relates to forex loss.93.The Appellant asserted that the said forex loss in FY 2018 does not relate to its distribution related transactions but a one-off correction to a long-term loan. That the Appellant attached the loan movement schedule to its pleadings.94.The Appellant clarified that KONE Corporation assists the Appellant with some hedging and foreign exchange activities which helps minimize the forex risk loss.h. Without prejudice to the grounds above, the Respondent's assessment is beyond the statutory assessment time limit of 5 years as clearly provided for under Section 31(4) of theTax Procedures Act(TPA).95.That Section 31(4)(b) of the TPA provides that:“The Commissioner may amend an assessment(a)in the case of gross or willful neglect, evasion, or fraud by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer, at any time, or(b)in any other case, within five years of(i)for a self-assessment, the date that the self-assessment taxpayer submitted the self-assessment return to which the self-assessment relates.”96.That further, Section 2 of the TPA defines a reporting period as:“for the income tax, the year of income or, when section 27 of theIncome Tax Actapplies, the accounting period of the taxpayer...”97.That in applying the above legal provisions in this case, the reporting period to which income tax relates to that the Respondent may assess, relates only to the year 2018 going forward. That therefore, the Respondent's assessment and tax demand for the 2016 to 2017 years of income is time barred.98.That indeed, the Respondent in its assessment or objection decision has not illustrated or provided any information to show that its issuance of assessment beyond 5 years is as a result of proven gross, or wilful neglect, or tax evasion by the Appellant.i. Without prejudice to the grounds above, the Respondent erred in law and in fact by issuing a demand covering periods in excess of the audit period without due notice to the Appellant.99.That when the Respondent issued a notice of intention to audit to the Appellant, the period of audit according to the letter dated 27thMarch, 2020 was outlined as December 2015 to December 2018. That however, the Respondent proceeded to expand the assessment to the period 2016 to 2021 without any prior notice or subsequent reasons for the same.100.That procedurally, the expectation is that the Respondent ought to communicate its intention to extend the period of the audit. That the Appellant is not aware of any notice extending the audit period post December 2018. That this is yet another clear illustration of the Appellant’s concerns around the lack of fairness of this administrative process and the Respondent's blatant disregard for procedure with respect to the audit.101.The Appellant further averred that this extension of the period under audit without notice was done in bad faith.102.The Appellant stated that the actions and omission of the Respondent to communicate the period of assessment amounts to unfair administrative action by the Respondent contrary to Article 47 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya.103.That in that regard, the Appellant refuted the assessment by the Respondent for the period 2019-2021 on the basis that it was erroneously arrived at and the Appellant was denied the right to procedural fairness as espoused within Article 47 ofthe Constitution.Appellant’s Prayers104.The Appellant prayed that this Tribunal:a.Vacates the assessment relating to the periods 2016 and 2017 in the first instanceb.Sets aside the Respondent’s objection decision dated 20thDecember, 2022 in its entirety with costs to the Appellant.c.Be pleased to issue any other remedies that the Honourable Tribunal deems just and reasonable.Respondent’s Case105.The Respondent’s case is premised on the hereunder filed documents:-i.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 24thFebruary, 2023 and filed on the same date together with the documents attached thereto.ii.The Respondent’s bundle of documents dated 5thFebruary, 2024 and filed electronically on the same date.iii.The Respondent’s witness statement of George Nzoka dated 8thSeptember, 2023, filed on 11thSeptember, 2023 and admitted as evidence under oath on 6thFebruary, 2024.106.The Respondent stated that the Appellant officially commenced its operations in Kenya in August 2014 after a successful acquisition of Marryat and Scott (Kenya) and Marryat East Africa (Uganda). That Marryat and Scott was at the time the sole and routine distributor of KONE products in East Africa since late 1999. That however, following the acquisition, the Appellant has grown to become one of the fastest-growing elevator and escalator companies in East Africa, currently serving over 600 clients. That its services include providing industry-leading elevators, escalators, and innovative solutions for maintenance and modernization of the equipment.107.That the Appellant's main customers for its new equipment business are developers, main contractors, architects and other contributors in the construction sector. That the Appellant also provides maintenance services (after-sales) to its customers and to this end has secured contracts for maintaining the already installed equipment.108.The Respondent averred that the Appellant's right to distribute KONE's products in the region is authorized via the Franchise Agreement dated 1st January, 2018 between the Appellant and KONE Finland a related party.109.That from the Appellant's audited financial statements for FY2016 to FY2018, it is indicated that it made intercompany purchases totaling to Kshs. 1.2 billion. That however, over the period, the Appellant returned negative operating margins. That this necessitated compensation from KONE Finland amounting to Kshs. 423M over the period. That it is this position that precipitated the transfer pricing audit of the Appellant to ascertain whether the transactions with its related parties were at armlength.110.The Respondent stated that the transfer pricing audit was carried out for the period 2016 to 2018 with an outcome whose uniform methodologies were applied for the subsequent assessment issued for the period 2016-2021.111.That in arriving at the assessment, the Respondent undertook a benchmarking analysis and computed the profit margins of the Appellant using comparable 3rd parties in similar business.112.The Respondent reiterated that in arriving at the assessment, the Appellant's business model was well appreciated, Functions, Assets & Risks (FAR) considered and the consequent adjustments were justified. That this is corroborated by the following facts:a.An analysis of the Franchise Agreement dated 1stJanuary, 2018 with KONE Finland reveals that the Appellant has been granted a nonexclusive license to use KONE technology, knowhow, show-how, trademarks and IT systems for the conduct of frontline business. That the Appellant has also been granted rights to use 3rdparty systems for the conduct of its business, receives various services from Kone Finland in a bid to improve performance efficiency etc. That further terms of the Agreement are summarised in the notice of preliminary audit findings, assessment and the objection decision.b.That upon review of the Appellant's Transfer Pricing Policy, it was established that its transaction with related parties was not at arm’s length and the model used by the Appellant to arrive at the transfer price was thus unacceptable. That the audit revealed that the applied 5% operating margin compensation to the Appellant relates to a routine distributor which does not apply to the Appellant. That to the contrary, the Appellant is in fact an integrated distributor bearing more risks as opposed to the routine distributor. That accordingly, the margin adopted did not remunerate the Appellant its fair share of return based on the functions it performs, assets employed and risks assumed in the transaction leading to erosion of the Kenya's tax base and shifting of profits. That this position is corroborated by the following:i.The Appellant does not routinely sell / distribute the equipment to the customers in their imported original form. That customers enter into contracts with the Appellant to get a finished and functional product. That as such, the sale entails the product cost as well as installation. That the installation ensures that the Group products (machines) are functional. That this is corroborated by the packing list to the custom declarations/ documentation which invariably demonstrates that the equipment is not imported as single unit but rather as parts making up the unit. That it is then that the parts are assembled by the Appellant, sold and installed to a specific customer hence the value addition by the Appellant.ii.That the Appellant has employed qualified personnel to source for clients/customers and technicians to conduct installation and maintenance services to its customers. That accordingly, its role is not merely to distribute but equally to expand the market base of customers. That the Appellant engages in sales and marketing to push the product into the market with uncompensated set targets from the Group. That indeed, the growth of the Group and the expanded market share in Kenya is largely attributed to the robust roles the employees and the Appellant play.iii.That the Appellant bears significant inventory risk under the 'non- return point' transfer policy which provides that all affiliates purchasing machines from the Groups manufacturing units bear all costs for production as long as the manufacturing process has begun. That in the event, a customer turns down an order, the Appellant bears the loss incurred in such instances. The Respondent noted that the Appellant admitted to having measures put in place to moderate risks and gave explanations on the same, which confirms that the Appellant bears full risks arising from cancellation of an order by a customer.iv.That the Appellant also bears forex risks as it purchases its goods from related parties in foreign currencies (EURO, RMB, and USD) but sells its products in Kenya Shillings. That it is thus exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to currency flows from revenues and expenses. That further, there are credit risks incurred by the Appellant where a customer fails to pay for the work done and in relation to loans taken.v.That the prices charged to customers are not at the Appellant's own discretion but purely determined by the Group billing system (KTOC Tool). That by using this tool, Kone Corporation is able to control the prices to third parties by its subsidiaries. That the single objective of using this tool is to squeeze the Appellant's profit margins in Kenya.113.That from the foregoing, it is clear that the Appellant does not have control of prices to third parties, has qualified staff for various areas (sales, technical and installation) and equally bears all the risks involved. That based on the above, the Appellant could not be treated as routine distributor since the services offered went beyond the conduct of a routine distributor but that of a non- routine distributor.114.That the Appellant's model was therefore at variance with the independent third-party companies (Maryatt & Scott) which was initially engaged by the Group and whose business terms demonstrated routine Distributorship Agreement. That relevant clauses of the Maryatt & Scott Group Distributorship Agreement supporting this position are 2.1, 2.2, 3.2 and 3.4. That the KONE Group acquired the business of Maryatt & Scott principally to own the market as a Group and not through a 3rd party company.115.That it was thus clear that the business terms and model adopted between the Appellant and the group was solely meant to reduce taxable profit in Kenya. That consequently, the Respondent was justified to adjust the prices in order to reflect the arm’s length price payable.116.The Respondent stated that in arriving at the adjustment, it was able to differentiate between the Appellant's controlled transactions and third-party transactions. That the Respondent’s main focus was on the controlled transaction being the purchase of equipment from related parties for resale. That contrary to the Appellant's position therefore, no third-party sales were considered as controlled transactions.117.In regard to bench-marking, the Respondent averred that bearing in mind that the Appellant's margins of 5% failed to take into account the FAR as highlighted above, the Appellant was requested to provide segregated financial statements and sales invoices to its customers/ 3rd party invoices to enable the Respondent delineate the transactions so as to establish the appropriate transfer pricing method and determination of the correct arm’s length margins.118.That however, the Appellant neglected, failed and ignored the request and the same has not been provided even to the Tribunal. That the Appellant therefore cannot aver that the margins used by the Respondent were erroneous but equally fail to provide information that would justify its position. That in the absence of such information, the Appellant has not demonstrated the Respondent's misapplication of the benchmarking report.119.That Section 59 of the Tax Procedure Act states that:“(1)For the purposes of obtaining full information in respect of the tax liability of any person or class of persons, or for any other purposes relating to a tax law, the Commissioner or an authorised officer may require any person, by notice in writing, to-(a)produce for examination, at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, any documents (including in electronic format) that are in the person's custody or under the person's control relating to the tax liability of any person;(b)furnish information relating to the tax liability of any person in the manner and by the time as specified in the notice; or(c)attend, at the time and place specified in the notice, for the purpose of giving evidence in respect of any matter or transaction appearing to be relevant to the tax liability of any person.”120.That the Tax Procedure Act places the onus of proof on the Appellant who in this case failed to avail evidence that would support a contrary position to the assessment or that would have guided the Respondent at arriving to a different objection decision.121.That Section 56 of theTax Procedures Actprovides as follows:-“In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”122.The Respondent posited that the Appellant's Transfer Pricing Policy was indeed considered and based on the said Policy and the Franchise Agreement entered into with its parent, the Appellant falls within the ambit of an integrated distributor/ non-routine rather than a routine distributor. That accordingly, the benchmarking analysis adopted cannot be faulted and the burden falls on the Appellant in any case to demonstrate otherwise by providing credible evidence.123.The Respondent also stated that in its tax computations in the assessment, the Appellant’s assessed income (Earnings Before interest and Tax), excluded all allowable deductions including interest expense arising from finance costs on loans.124.That Section 31(1) of the TPA states that:“Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the ""original assessment"") by making alterations or additions, from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner's judgement, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period.”125.That further Section 31(4) of the TPA provides thus:“The Commissioner may amend an assessment-(b)in any other case, within five years of -(i)for a self-assessment, the date that the self-assessment taxpayer submitted the self-assessment return to which the self-assessment relates; or…”126.The Respondent additionally stated that the Appellant filed its self-assessment for the year 2016 in March 2019 and for the period 2017 was filed in August 2019. That going by this, the Respondent was within the statutory limit of five years since the Appellant filed its self-assessment in 2019 and the notice of assessment was issued on 22ndSeptember, 2022. That accordingly, the Respondent was well within the statutory limits in issuing the assessment.127.That in its objection and Appeal, the Appellant has not demonstrated how the assessments for the period 2019-2021 were in any way erroneous or excessive as the same were based on the Respondent's ‘best of judgment’.128.The Respondent reiterated that any variance between the assessment issued through the iTax system and manually was well explained in the objection decision.129.That the objection decision, which is the subject matter to the Appeal before the Tribunal, was with respect to the assessment for the period 2016-2018 and it is the same period that the Appellant had lodged an objection on. That the period of the assessment was therefore well clear to the Appellant from the time of audit and entries in iTax, which is an administrative tool, and cannot be used as a basis of challenging the validity of an assessment. The Respondent further reiterated the provisions of Section 78 of the TPA.Respondent’s Prayers130.The Respondent prayed for orders that:a.This Tribunal upholds the Respondent's decision dated 22ndDecember, 2022 confirming the assessment of Kshs. 57,168,070.00b.This Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid any merit.Issues for Determination131.The Tribunal has considered the pleadings, submissions and witness statements filed by both parties and is of the view that the issues falling for its determination are:-i.Whether the Respondent’s assessments were within the five year statutory limit prescribed under Section 31(4)ii.Whether the Respondent’s assessment was justifiedAnalysis and Findings132.The Tribunal having established the issues falling for its determination, proceeds to analyse them as hereunder.i. Whether the Respondent’s assessments were within the five year statutory limit prescribed under Section 31(4)133.The Appellant argued that the Respondent issued assessments beyond the five year statutory limit while the Respondent argued that the assessments were within time.134.The Tribunal reviewed the parties’ pleadings and established that the assessments issued by the Respondent related to the years 2016 to 2021.135.Section 31(4) of theTax Procedures Actprovides as follows in regard to the amendment of a self-assessment return by the Commissioner:“The Commissioner may amend an assessment—(a)in the case of gross or wilful neglect, evasion, or fraud by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer, at any time; or(b)in any other case, within five years of—for a self-assessment, the date that the self-assessment taxpayer submitted the self-assessment return to which the self-assessment relates; or…”136.The Tribunal notes that the Respondent stated that the Appellant filed its self-assessment for the year 2016 in March 2019 and for the period 2017 in August 2019. This particular allegation by the Respondent was not rebutted by the Appellant in its pleadings. The Appellant only claimed that the reporting period that the Respondent should have assessed related to the year 2018 going forward; hence relying on calendar dates in defining the limit of five years.137.The Tribunal seeks to clarify the provisions of Section 31(4) which relate to the statutory limit of an amendment of an assessment by the Commissioner. Section 31(4)(ii) expressly states that the timeline is directly related to the date that the self-assessment taxpayer submitted the self-assessment return to which the self-assessment relates. Therefore, the five year timeline only counts from the date the taxpayer makes a self-assessment declaration/ return.138.Going by this, and the fact that the Appellant did not rebut the Respondent’s allegation that it filed its 2016 and 2017 returns in 2019, the Tribunal can only conclude that the Respondent was within the statutory limit of five years since the Appellant filed its self-assessment for the years in question in 2019 and the notice of assessment was issued on 22ndSeptember, 2022 which is well within five years.ii. Whether the Respondent’s assessment was justified139.The genesis of this dispute was the imposition of transfer pricing adjustments by the Respondent on the Appellant’s transactions.140.The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred in failing to understand the Appellant's business model, leading to an incorrect and unjustified segmentation of the Appellant's financial statements resulting in erroneous assessments.141.The Respondent on its part argued that in arriving at the assessment, the Appellant's business model was well appreciated, Functions, Assets & Risks (FAR) considered and the consequent adjustments were justified. That further, the Appellant does not have control of prices to third parties, has qualified staff for various areas (sales, technical and installation) and equally bears all the risks involved. That based on the above, the Appellant could not be treated as a routine distributor since the services offered went beyond the conduct of a routine distributor but that of a non-routine distributor142.The Tribunal reviewed the parties’ pleadings and the witnesses’ testimonies and proceeded to review the confirmed assessment based on the following areas identified in the pleadings of the parties.i. The role of the Appellant and its risk analysis143.The Franchise Fee Agreement between KONE Corporation and KONE Kenya provides the following terms of engagement:a.Under the preamble to the Agreement, that KONE Kenya Limited desires to obtain from KONE Corporation, and KONE Corporation is willing to grant KONE Kenya Limited, a non-exclusive licence (or sub-licence as the case may require) for the duration of this Agreement to use KONE technology, Know-How, tools and processes developed by KONE, Trade Marks as well as technical assistance and training and certain management and support services as included, but not limited, in this Agreement to be used in relation to sale, installation, maintenance and modernization and repair of elevators, escalators, autowalks and automated doors in the Territory as defined in this Agreement.b.That under Clause 4.1, KONE Corporation hereby grants to KONE Kenya Limited a non-exclusive license(or sub-license as the case may be) for the duration of this Agreement to use the:i.KONE Technology;ii.Know-How;iii.Show-How;iv.Trade Marks; andv.IT systemsfor the conduct of the Front Line's business and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.144.The Appellant maintained that it assumes limited risks relating to marketing, sales, distribution and maintenance of the products locally. That the company utilizes bundle of IP, solutions, processes and tools developed, owned and provided by KONE Corporation for KONE Kenya to perform its routine distribution and servicing functions in accordance with the KONE Way processes and guidelines. That KONE Kenya does not own any significant intangible property.145.The Respondent, in its pleadings argued that the Appellant is in fact an integrated distributor bearing more risks as opposed to the routine distributor. That accordingly, the margin adopted did not remunerate the Appellant its fair share of return based on the functions it performs, assets employed and risks assumed in the transaction leading to erosion of Kenya's tax base and shifting of profits.146.Chapter I, Paragraph D 1.2 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017 and 2022 provide as follows regarding functional analysis:“1.51.In transactions between two independent enterprises, compensation usually will reflect the functions that each enterprise performs (taking into account assets used and risks assumed). Therefore, in delineating the controlled transaction and determining comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions or entities, a functional analysis is necessary. This functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.”147.Further, the above guidance states that the analysis focuses on what the parties actually do and the capabilities they provide. Such activities and capabilities will include decision-making, including decisions about business strategy and risks. That while one party may provide a large number of functions relative to that of the other party to the transaction, it is the economic significance of those functions in terms of their frequency, nature, and value to the respective parties to the transactions that is important.148.Paragraph 1.34 of the aforementioned Guidelines provides that the typical process of identifying the commercial or financial relations between the associated enterprises and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations requires a broad-based understanding of the industry sector in which the MNE Group operates (e.g. mining, pharmaceutical, luxury goods) and of the factors affecting the performance of any business operating in that sector.149.Further, Paragraph 1.36 of the Guidelines provides that:“The economically relevant characteristics or comparability factors that need to be identified in the commercial or financial relations between the associated enterprises in order to accurately delineate the actual transaction can be broadly categorized as follows:The contractual terms of the transaction (D.1.1).The functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction, taking into account assets used and risks assumed, including how those functions relate to the wider generation of value by the MNE group to which the parties belong, the circumstances surrounding the transaction, and industry practices (D.1.2).The characteristics of property transferred or services provided (D.1.3).The economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate (D.1.4).The business strategies pursued by the parties (D.1.5).”150.The Tribunal established from the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document that KONE Corporation undertakes all risks related to products and their installation which is actively controlled and inspected by KONE Group’s subcontractors, research and development, technological innovations, patents and trademarks, its Information Technology(IT) environment by centralization of IT operations, and manufacturing and sourcing of elevator components through its global sourcing functions. This is expressly provided for under Clauses 2.6, 3, 4 and 5 of the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document provided in the pleadings.151.Further, under the First Schedule to the Franchise Fee Agreement, KONE Corporation undertakes all marketing activities and all brand and trademark enhancement activities.152.The distributors, of which the Appellant is one, are responsible for distributing KONE products in the local markets through their own sales forces. This includes the negotiation of prices with the customers. This is provided for under Clause 5.1 to the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document.153.Paragraph D.1.2.1. of Chapter 1 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017 and 2022 states as follows regarding analysis of risks in commercial or financial relations:“1.63.Risk management is not the same as assuming a risk. Risk assumption means taking on the upside and downside consequences of the risk with the result that the party assuming a risk will also bear the financial and other consequences if the risk materializes. A party performing part of the risk management functions may not assume the risk that is the subject of its management activity, but may be hired to perform risk mitigation functions under the direction of the risk-assuming party. For example, the day-to-day mitigation of product recall risk may be outsourced to a party performing monitoring of quality control over a specific manufacturing process according to the specifications of the party assuming the risk.”154.It is clear to the Tribunal, based on the foregoing references to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017 and 2022 and the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document that the Appellant undertakes limited risks in relation to the business and these are sales, distribution and maintenance of the products locally.155.On the other hand, KONE Corporation undertakes all risks related to products and their installation, research and development, technological innovations, patents and trademarks, Information Technology (IT) systems, manufacturing and sourcing of elevator components, through its global sourcing functions as well as tangible assets (manufacturing equipment, IT systems, amongst others) and intangible assets (including intellectual property including Technology, Patents, Utility Models and Designs, KONE brand as well as tools and processes).156.In relation to inventory risk, the Tribunal notes that new equipment purchases by the Appellant are based on the customer order, thus the Appellant holds very limited inventory and only in relation to certain key spare parts. The Appellant controls the inventory levels in accordance with KONE processes with KONE material management system DBS and regular inventories as outlined in the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document.157.In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal found that the Appellant was classifiable to be a routine distributor based on the limited risks it undertook. Further, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent was not justified in concluding that the Appellant bears the product liability risk that would therefore effect an increase in the level of remuneration accorded to it in the transaction.ii. Product pricing158.The Tribunal has established that the Appellant uses a KTOC tool that provides data handling ability and speedy price resolution/ quotations.159.That in relation to third party maintenance, in the Appellant’s “KONE Group Contribution Analysis” document, it is well stated that KONE 3rdparty Competence Centers create competencies for third party equipment maintenance on a global basis. That when negotiating with the customer, the local sales entities will then define the exact customer price for the defined solutions and services based on the global pricing model using global pricing tools. That this modularization minimizes the scope for inappropriate scoping and pricing to customers by local affiliates.160.The Tribunal thus notes that the KTOC tool is used by applying all price components based on the local affiliates’ assessment of local market conditions. The tool then calculates a recommended price based on these local market specifications. Notably, while the tool produces a recommended price, Clause 5.1 of the KONE Group Contribution Analysis document provides that the local entities are mandated with price negotiation with end consumers.161.The Tribunal further notes that Clause 6.1.4 of the “KONE Group Contribution analysis” document states, inter alia, as follows in regard to “Control of Global SEB Unit”:“The economic situation (the marketplace), local and regional regulations, competitors and the customers are strong forces that impact KONE's business environment in the service business.To control the above factors and grow profitable business (including both winning contracts), KONE Corporation (Global SEB Management) carefully controls key pricing decisions through globally available pricing data and frequent pricing reviews. Price rises must be made by local entities in a timely manner to ensure maintenance portfolio (e.g. by customer segment, by contract type, by equipment type) can be reviewed using the tools provided by Global SEB.”162.The aforementioned document further states under Clause 6.1.4 as follows:“The other focus area of global control by KONE Corporation is to improve the SEB Management undertakes invoicing reviews of local sales entities to ensure all know the contract scope. The purpose of these reviews is also to reduce the issuing of unnecessary credit notes.”163.The Tribunal additionally notes that the Respondent provided an Agreement that was between KONE Corporation and Maryat and Scott which outlined the terms of the former contract that KONE Corporation has with the previous local entity that traded in its products.164.In contrast to the pricing terms in the current Franchising Agreement between KONE Corporation and KONE Kenya Limited, Clause 3.4 of the aforementioned Agreement stated as follows:“The Distributor shall be free to establish and revise its resale prices provided that the competitiveness of the products is maintained…”165.It is apparent therefore to the Tribunal that the current pricing decisions by the local Kenyan affiliate are partially controlled by KONE Corporation to ensure that local affiliates maintain certain pricing parameters in their businesses.iii. Group transfer pricing and benchmark analysis of the arm’s length operating level166.Paragraph D.1 of Chapter 1 of the 2017 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations guides that the application of the arm's length principle is based on a comparison of the conditions in a controlled transaction with the conditions that would have been made had the parties been independent and undertaking a comparable transaction under comparable circumstances.167.The Appellant stated that in its view, the controlled transactions to be tested were the purchases of goods from related parties and payment of the franchise fee and the most appropriate method selected to test the arm's length result of these controlled transactions is the transactional net margin method whereby the operating profit earned by the Appellant in its distribution activity is compared to the operating profits earned by similar independent distribution and servicing companies.168.The Appellant averred that in order to arrive at an arms-length position, it engaged a third-party service provider to perform a comparable company analysis to benchmark the arm's length operating profit return earned by comparable distribution, maintenance and installation companies operating on comparable industries to that of KONE Kenya. That it attached the benchmarking analysis used for the period under review to its pleadings.169.The Respondent argued that in reference to the Franchise Agreement dated 1stJanuary, 2018 between the Appellant and KONE Finland, the overall operating margins for KONE Kenya should not exceed or go below 5%. That in a case where the margins go below 5% the company would pay a franchise fee which, according to the Respondent, has not been paid to date.170.The Respondent further stated that the assessing team identified the purchase of equipment as the inherent intercompany transaction from related parties. That this was contrary to the Appellant’s assertion that the selling price to third parties was used as the controlled transaction.171.Due to the dispute as to the identity of the controlled transaction in this dispute, the Tribunal referred to the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing) Rules, 2006 which define a controlled transaction to mean a transaction which is monitored to ensure payment of an arm’s length price for goods or services.172.The Tribunal having analyzed the pleadings of the parties established that the transactions that are considered to be controlled in the instant dispute are the intra-group purchases of equipment and parts. It is further clear that the disputed transaction by the Respondent is the resale price of equipment to end consumers. In its assessment, the Respondent categorically stated that maintenance contracts of the distributed KONE equipment is an uncontrolled transaction since it is between KONE Kenya and third parties. It however specifically identified/ segregated equipment installation and maintenance business as the controlled transaction.173.The Tribunal notes that the benchmarking study undertaken by the Appellant focused on comparable companies primarily involved in the servicing, maintenance and installation functions and thus earning higher profits compared to traditional buy-sell activities only.174.The Tribunal further notes that the study encompassed entities undertaking similar transactions as the Appellant and its related entity including repair and installation of various kinds of machinery and equipment. It also factored in independence/ ownership, operating revenue/ turnover and operating profit/loss. It thereafter considered the profit level indicators and determined the arm’s length range to be a median of 2.72% while the inter-quartile range was between 1.59% and 6.72%. The operating margin levels were determined to range between 0.01% and 15.10%.175.The Respondent in its assessment segregated the two transactions: intra-group purchases of equipment and parts from the sales to and maintenance services offered to end consumers, to arrive at its assessment.176.From the pleadings, the Tribunal further notes that the operating profits of the Appellant ranged between 8.2% and 15.6% in the years 2016 - 2021.177.On its part, the Respondent stated that it determined the arm’s length operating profit to be in the range of 7.81% to 18.95% with a median of 11.72% based on its conclusion that the Appellant was a fully-fledged distributor performing all the sales and distribution functions from marketing to inventory management and bearing the associated risks. This is based on the tax assessment dated 22nd September, 2022 and the comparables provided by the Respondent.178.Paragraph 3.60 of the OECD TP Guidelines provides as follows in regard to selecting the most appropriate point in the range:“If the relevant condition of the controlled transaction (e.g. price or margin) is within the arm’s length range, no adjustment should be made.”179.Paragraph 3.62 provides further as follows:“In determining this point, where the range comprises results of relatively equal and high reliability, it could be argued that any point in the range satisfies the arm’s length principle. Where comparability defects remain as discussed in paragraph 3.57, it may be appropriate to use measures of central tendency to determine this point (for instance the median, the mean or weighted averages, etc., depending on the specific characteristics of the data set), in order to minimize the risk of error due to unknown or unquantifiable remaining comparability defects.”180.In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal notes that the operating profit as provided by the Appellant in its pleadings was computed and found to fall between 8.2% and 15.6% as per the table below depicting the Appellants pre-operating profits for the years under dispute:KES'000201620172018201920202021*Revenue628,3701,299,829739,8091,511,5141,131,6441,063,749Cost of sales-534,056-1,057,215-527,499-1,154,661-618,832-569,228Gross profit94,314242,614212,310356,853512,812494,521Gross profit%15.0%18.7%28.7%23.6%45.3%46.5%Other income165,276112,393145,864008,332Operating expenses-179,325-240,056-269,924-232,278-371,800-336,700Operating profit80,265114,95188,250124,575141,012166,153Operating profit%12.8%8.8%11.9%8.2%12.5%15.6%Notably, this range in the years under dispute is within the Respondent’s range of 7.81% to 18.95% and as guided in Paragraph 3.62 of the OECD TP Guidelines highlighted in the previous paragraphs, satisfies the arm’s length principle.181.In this regard, the Tribunal finds no justification for the adjustments made by the Respondent on the operating profits as declared by the Appellant.iv. Brand and trademark enhancement182.In regard to the Respondent’s claim that the Appellant should be able to benefit from activities that enhance the Group’s brand and trademark in the region as per Paragraph 6.78 of the OECD TP Guidelines, the Tribunal notes that the said Paragraph provides as follows:“When the distributor actually bears the cost of its marketing activities (for example, when there is no arrangement for the legal owner to reimburse the expenditures), the analysis should focus on the extent to which the distributor is able to share in the potential benefits deriving from its functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed currently or in the future. In general, in arm’s length transactions the ability of a party that is not the legal owner of trademarks and other marketing intangibles to obtain the benefits of marketing activities that enhance the value of those intangibles will depend principally on the substance of the rights of that party….” (Emphasis ours)183.The Tribunal notes that from the First Schedule to the Franchise Fee Agreement, the obligation to undertake brand development and reputation management, events and fairs, as well as developing KONE’s strategic messages such as People Flow was the mandate of KONE Corporation and not KONE Kenya Limited.184.In this regard, the Tribunal finds that there was no justification by the Respondent for an adjustment on the basis of brand and trademark enhancement by KONE Kenya Limited.v. Franchise fee185.The Tribunal has reviewed the Appellant’s Franchise Fee Agreement and its global transfer pricing model, which was attached to its pleadings.186.The Tribunal has established that KONE Corporation charges the Appellant a franchise fee for the right to use KONE technology, know-how, show-how, trademarks, IT systems, methods and processes developed by KONE Corporation based on the Franchise Fee Agreement.187.The Franchise Fee Agreement provides that the franchise fee will be calculated under the arm's length principle as a percentage of KONE Kenya's net sales and operating profits that are based on the attainment of an arm’s length level in each year. That in 2016-2021, the benchmarked franchise fee rate has been 9.5% of net sales.188.The Franchise Fee Agreement also states that ""the fee in respect of any Year shall not exceed such amount as would reduce the Operating Profit of the Front Line for that year to an amount below the arms' length level for the Year defined in Schedule 2"".189.It follows therefore that the franchise fee is tied to the operating profits in any given year. In this regard, with the Tribunal having found that the Respondent was not justified in making adjustments to the operating profits of the Appellant, it further finds that the Respondent was not justified in making adjustments in relation to the franchise fees.vi. Loan corrections in Financial Year 2018190.The Respondent’s averred, in its assessment, that the Appellant remains potentially exposed to risks from foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to currency flows from revenue and expenses is not correct.191.The Appellant on its part argued that, from a review of its financial statements, the Respondent has taken an erroneous view that since the Appellant purchases its goods from related parties in foreign currencies but sells its products in Kenya Shillings the Appellant is exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.192.That on the basis of the above assumption the Respondent proceeded to make an adjustment on a long-term loan in the Appellant's financial statements claiming that it relates to forex loss.193.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant asserted, in its Statement of Facts, that the said forex loss in FY 2018 does not relate to its distribution related transactions but a one-off correction to a long-term loan. The Appellant stated that it attached the loan movement schedule to its pleadings.194.The Tribunal has reviewed the Appellant’s pleadings as well as the attachments and notes that the Appellant provided the following documents to support the one-off foreign exchange adjustment in FY 2018:i.An in-house bank account agreement between itself and Kone Corporation, Finland dated 20thJanuary, 2015.ii.An amendment agreement to the in-house bank account Agreement dated 19thDecember, 2017.iii.A term loan agreement between the Appellant and Kone International N.V. Belgium dated 18thJune, 2014.iv.A computation showing the loan revaluation, interest expenses and foreign exchange adjustment in FY 2018.v.A loan movement schedule covering the years 2014 through 2019.195.A review of the above listed documents confirmed that indeed the Appellant undertook an adjustment to its long term loan in FY 2018 that resulted in foreign exchange adjustments that resulted in a forex loss of Kshs. 89,616,387.00. Specifically, the computation on the adjustment is as depicted the below:-Kone Kenya Ltd Corporate LoanAmount in 000s2018Loan principle (USD)1,200Loan principle (USD)4,800Total loans (USD)6,000Kshs. Value (per AFS )611,686Revaluation Cumulative(65,420)Finance Costs per (AFS)Int. Exp.40,122Net FX (gains)/ Losses89,617129,739196.Based on the provided information, the Tribunal confirms that indeed the Appellant made a one-off correction to its long term loan which resulted in a variation of its interest expense and the forex loss in the year 2018.197.Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actprovides as follows regarding burden of proof in tax disputes:“In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving—(a)where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; or(b)in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”198.Section 56 of the TPA further states as follows regarding burden of proof in tax appeals:“(1)In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”199.While it is settled that the burden of proof in tax cases lies with the Appellant as is encapsulated in Section 30 of the TAT Act, this onus may, however, shift to the Respondent if the Appellant has made a prima facie case. In this case, the onus may then shift to the Respondent to rebut the prima facie case failure to which the taxpayer succeeds.200.This position was explained in the case of Kenya Revenue Authority v Maluki Kitili Mwendwa [2021] eKLR, where Mativo J ( as he then was) adopted the doctrine in the Canadian Supreme Court case of Johnston v Minister of National Revenue where the court {1948} S.C.R. 486 where the court decided that:“… the onus is on the taxpayer to “demolish the basic fact on which the taxation rested.” Again, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on this issue in Hickman Motors Ltd. v Canada which held that the onus is met when a taxpayer makes out at least a prima facie case. Prima facie is another legal term that literally means “on its face.” To prove a case “on its face” you must provide evidence that, unless rebutted, would prove your position. According to the said decision, a prima facie case is made when the taxpayer can produce unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence. Once the taxpayer has made out a prima facie case to prove the facts, the onus then shifts to the Revenue Authority to rebut the prima facie case. If the Revenue Authority cannot provide any evidence to prove their position, the taxpayer will succeed…”201.It follows therefore, in regard to the forex loss in 2018, the Appellant discharged its burden of proof as required under Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actand Section 56 of the Tax Procedure Act.202.As a result, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent was not justified in raising the assessment in relation to the forex loss in FY 2018.Final Decision203.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited. Consequently, the Tribunal makes the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.b.The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 20thDecember, 2022 be and is hereby set aside.c.Each Party to bear its own costs.204.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RDDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA - CHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

      [2024] KEELRC 2179 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Employment and Labour Relations Court at NairobiCause E953 of 2021NJ Abuodha, JSeptember 6, 2024BetweenMary Wanjiku KagoClaimantandInades Formation KenyaRespondentJudgment1.The Claimant filed her claim on 8thNovember, 2021 and pleaded inter alia as follows: -a.The Claimant entered in to a contract of employment with the Respondent dated 12thNovember,2018 where she was engaged as Chief Administration and Finance. That the contract was for a term of 2 years ending on 11thNovember,2020.b.The Claimant averred that during her employment with the Respondent she diligently and faithfully performed and discharged all her tasks and responsibilities as set out in the contract of employment which she served the contract in full. That after the lapse of her contract the Respondent extended the contract for a period of six months which she averred was discriminatory since contracts of other employees in similar rank to her had their contracts extended for a period of three years.c.The Claimant averred that while serving her extended contract she was shocked to receive a termination notice date 30thApril,2021 informing her that her contract which was in force up to 31stJuly, 2021 would be terminated. That in the said termination notice the Respondent made serious allegations about her character and performance in the discharge of her contractual duties while under employment by the Respondent.d.The Claimant further averred that she was never afforded the opportunity to challenge and/or respond to the said highly prejudicial allegations made against her by the Respondent and contained in the said termination notice contrary to the principle of fair hearing as espoused in the Kenyan Constitution and the labour laws.e.The Claimant averred that the termination notice was inconsistent and full of contradictions because on one hand the Respondent alleged that it terminated her on non-performance while on the other hand it alleged that the employment contract lapsed through effluxion of time. That the said contradictions showed that the Respondent intended to terminate her employment to her great prejudice and detriment.f.The Claimant averred that she was never subjected to any disciplinary process by the Respondent on account non-performance and dereliction of her duties as required by law. That there were deliberations and discussions between her and the Respondent but the same deliberations were in form of normal performance management of her work where no adverse or incriminating allegations were made against her.g.The Claimant averred that the said allegations in the termination Notice were serious where she ought to have been issued with formal warning notices and being subjected to formal disciplinary process as required by law. That upon receipt of the said termination letter and being dissatisfied with the reasons thereon she wrote to the Respondent on 8thJuly,2021 stating that the said termination was unfair and unprocedural.h.The Claimant further averred that she was not aware of any complaints relating to her discharge of duties where she worked for the Respondent from Novemeber,2018 and was earning a monthly salary of Kshs 142,445/= at the time of dismissal. That she suffered loss and damage as the bread winner of her family due to the loss of her employment upon the unfair termination.2.The Claimant in the upshot prayed for the following against the Respondent;a.A declaration that the termination of employment contract of the Claimant by the Respondent was unfair, wrongful and illegal.b.Payment of the sum of Kshs 1,709,340/= equivalent to 12 months salary for the unfair and wrongful termination of the Claimant’s employment contractc.Payment of the sum of Kshs 284,890/= equivalent to two month’s salary being service pay for the period which the Claimant worked with the Respondent.d.Payment of the sum of Kshs 59,735/= being payment for 13 leave days which were accrued by the Claimant but which were not taken.Total claim Kshs 2,053,965/=e.Costs of the suit and interests.3.The Respondent filed its Statement of Response dated 16thDecember, 2021 and averred inter alia as follows:i.The Respondent admitted that the Claimant was their employee on fixed term contract which expired on 31stJuly,2021. That the Claimant commenced employment with the Respondent on 12thNovember,2018 as chief of Administration and Finance under an initial fixed term of two years commencing 12/11/2018 and ending 11/11/2020.ii.The Respondent averred that upon expiry of the initial term the same was extended for a further period of one and half months from 12th November,2020 and terminated on 31stDecembewr,2020. That upon the Claimant’s appraisal for the year ending December 2020 a further contract was executed between the parties for a period of 7 months with effect 1stJanuary,2021 to 31stJuly,2021.iii.The Respondent averred that it never terminated the Claimant’s contract and maintained that the same came to end by effluxion of time. That it was not under obligation to renew the Claimant’s contract and it was not prevented from pointing out her shortcomings during her employment. That there was no need for disciplinary hearing as the Claimant was not guilty of any misconduct requiring disciplinary hearing.iv.The Respondent averred that the extension of the Claimant’s contract for a period of seven months was not discriminatory and that the Claimant did not perform her duties satisfactorily during her tenure with the Respondent. That the Claimant was aware of her shortcomings in her discharge of her duties as brought out in the various meetings reports, performance appraisals, performance plans and communications between the Claimant and the Respondent.v.The Respondent denied the particulars of loss and damage stating that the Claimant was aware that she had a seven months contract that was to lapse on 31stJuly,2021. That the contract with the Claimant was procedurally and lawfully terminated and three months’ notice of intention of not to renew the contract duly issued to the Claimant hence she is not entitled to any damages for wrongful termination.vi.The Respondent averred that the Claimant was not entitled to any service pay for the period worked since the Respondent maintained a pension scheme with CFC Life Assurance Ltd and the Respondent having submitted her dues together with remittance of NSSF dues the Claimant was not entitled to any service pay. That the Claimant was not entitled to the 13 leave days.vii.The Respondent averred that the Claimant’s suit was bad in law and did not bring out any issues for determination and prayed it be dismissed with costs.Evidence4.The Claimant’s case was heard orally on 28thNovember,2023. The Claimant (CW1) testified in court and adopted her witness statement together with the pleadings filed in court as her evidence in chief.5.CW1 testified that her initial contract which commenced in November 2018 ended on November 2020 which was extended for one month. The donor contract was also ending hence it was extended awaiting the approval of donor budget. That she was later given a six month contract.6.CW1 testified that she was the only one whose contract was extended for one month pending approval of the budget. That everyone’s contract was ending in December so hers was extended for month so that she may be at par with the others.7.CW1 testified that appraisal was done but for everyone. That she was the only one given 7 months contract the others were given three years. That the appraisals filed in court were done with her concurrence. That she never signed it and she never participated in the appraisal. That she was not given one month’s notice of termination.8.CW1 testified that if it was effluxion of time it could have happened in July. That she was never put on PIP as the PIP documents filed in court were standard documents for all employees.9.In Cross-examination CW1 confirmed that her terms were contractual and fixed term. The last one was ending on 31stJuly,2021. That the letter indicated termination was in July,2021 and she continued working until her contract ended in July 2021. She further confirmed that she was not challenging the termination but she felt discriminated since everyone was given a three year contract That her job was advertised before she left and that she was given three months termination notice. That renewal as per article 5 was at the discretion of the employer.10.CW1 confirmed that renewal or extension was based on performance and article 8 provided for termination before end of contract which required one month’s notice of termination. That she did not call a witness to show they were given longer contracts.11.CW1 confirmed that she signed the Performance plan, Development plan and assessment because it was standard appraisal document for everyone. That she was taken through appraisal by the board member. That she never indicated on the document if she never agreed with it.12.CW1 confirmed that she was paid her terminal dues upon termination. That the employer had a pension scheme and the employer authorized release of pension contributions to her. She confirmed dropping the claim for leave days. She confirmed that renewal was responsibility of the employer and she never complained about the extension for 6 months.13.In Re-examination CW1 clarified that under article 5 she was not given an opportunity to express if she wanted her contract renewed. That there was no appraisal before termination and she was never taken for capacity development training. That the board member was not involved in day to day affairs of the organization hence he could be biased.14.The Respondent’s case was heard on 28thFebruary,2024 where the Respondent called two witnesses. The first witness was the IT expert who adopted his witness statement as his evidence in chief. RW1 testified that he serviced the Respondent’s computers and he printed the email from the Respondent’s servers. That he satisfied himself that the computers were in good condition without any viruses.15.In cross examination RW1 confirmed that he never filed electronic certificate. That the email were for a third party and he could not verify the allegations in the email.16.In reexamination RW1 Confirmed that as per his witness statement he serviced the computers and they were in good order free of any viruses.17.The second Respondent witness was the accountant who testified that he was a member of the board of the Respondent and chair of finance committee. He adopted his witness statement filed in court as his evidence in chief.18.RW2 stated that the Claimant’s engagement was on contractual basis with the last contract being the one ending on 31stJuly,2021. That the Claimant served fully all the contracts and was paid all her dues by the Respondent. He further stated that the Claimant’s contract was never terminated but it expired. That renewal was not automatic but depended among others on performance and whether there were enough donor funds and renewal was discretionary.19.RW 2 further testified that the Claimant signed a job description and that she was informed of her underperformance through appraisals which is documented between her and her supervisor. That the Claimant was well trained as trainings took place every month. That she was not discriminated by extending her contract for seven months and that she never complained about the contract when issued with it and further that she was given three months’ notice of non-renewal as per the organization policy.20.In cross examination RW2 confirmed that he was a board member when the Claimant was working and the day to day operations were responsibility of the Managing Director. That he appraised the Claimant who refused to be appraised by the MD.21.RW2 confirmed that staff contracts started and ended differently. That the Performance Management Report was for assessment period from January to December. That the document was appraisal form and part of PIP. That the Claimant was assessed by her supervisor and she refused to sign.22.RW2 confirmed that under article 5 notification of intention to renew was three months. That termination notice was one month or one month’s salary in lieu of notice. That the email between the Claimant and the MD were about work-related issues where she had issues with Audit.23.RW2 confirmed that the trainings were not before the court and that he could be copied in email between the Claimant and the MD when necessary.24.In Re-examination RW2 clarified that as per minutes of the board held on 5/12/2020 the Claimant was in attendance and that she refused to be appraised by the supervisor and that was how he came in.Claimants’ Submissions25.The Claimant through her written submissions dated 18thMarch,2024 and stated the termination notice was full of contradictions where at one hand it was based on her underperformance and on another hand on effluxion of time. That there were uncertainties as to the grounds and circumstances under which the contract terminated.26.It was the Claimant’s submissions that the termination notice barred her from expressing her intention to renew the contract one month to expiry. That the Respondent’s allegations that she was aware of her short comings in discharge of her duties was not true as the IFK Performance Management of 9thDecember,2020 did not in any way indicate that the Claimant did not satisfactorily perform her duties save for the email that followed the report.27.It was the Claimant’s submissions that the email and computer electronic evidence produced by the IT services Consultant could not be admissible as per section 106B (1) and (4) ofEvidence Actwhich evidence ought to be accompanied by certificate in accordance with Section 106(4) of theEvidence Actwhich the witness did not provide to the court to accompany the print out.28.The Claimant submitted that in all the email there was nowhere she indicated she did not want to be evaluated by the manager. The minutes of 5thDecember,2020 only pointed out that she was defensive on the feedback provided by the manager but not that she refused to be evaluated or appraised. The Claimant relied on the case of Abraham Gumba v Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (2014)eKLR on proof of poor performance. That the Respondent did not lead evidence to show the Claimant's performance had been assessed to show if she needed to improve or not. The Claimant relied on the burden of proof stipulated under section 47(5) of theEmployment Act.29.On the issue of whether the Claimant was discriminated when her contract was not extended for similar period as those of her peers the Claimant submitted that after lapse of her contract her contract was extended for 6 months yet her peers their contracts were extended for 3 years. That all contracts lapsed at the same time as it depended on donor funding. The Claimant relied on the case ofHesbon Ngaruiya Waigi vs Equitorial Commercial Bank Limited Industrial court at Nairobi cause No 60 of 2013on discrimination.30.On the issue of whether her termination of employment was valid both procedurally and substantively the Claimant submitted on section 41 on procedure and section 43 of theEmployment Acton valid reasons for termination. The Claimant relied on the case of Water Ogal Anuro v Teachers Service Commission(2013) eKLR on both procedural and substantive fairness.31.It was the Claimant’s submissions that the termination was unfair as it failed to adhere to mandatory provisions of section 41,43, 45 and 47(5) of theEmployment Act. That she was not afforded an opportunity to be heard which is against article 50 ofthe Constitutionin conjunction with the Fair Administrative Actions Act. That the Respondent’s witness confirmed that she was never issued with show cause letter and the process outlined under section 41 was never followed as there was no disciplinary hearing.32.It was the Claimant’s submissions that the Respondent claim that the notice was for nonrenewal of contract and not termination was not true. That the Respondent ought to have stated the issue of non-renewal without going to the grounds of the same. That the complaints of underperformance should have been brought to her attention during her tenure and be given chance to defend herself on those complaints under section 41 of theEmployment Act. She relied on the case of Mary Chemweno Kiptui vs Kenya Pipeline Company Limited(2014) eKLR on observant of section 41 above. That the dismissal was both substantively and procedurally unfair.33.On the issue of whether the Claimant was entitled to the reliefs sought the Claimant submitted that she was entitled to compensation for unfair termination as per section 49(1) (c) of theEmployment Actand proposed maximum compensation due to the manner of her termination which she alleged was unfair.34.The Claimant also submitted that she was entitled to the service pay of two months’ salary and submitted that she was paid salary for the last month and accrued leave days and abandoned the prayer for leave days.Respondents Submissions35.The Respondent filed its written submissions dated 25thApril, 2024 and submitted that vide the letter dated 30thApril,2021 they informed the Claimant that her contract would not be renewed. According to the respondent the claimant admitted that her contract was fixed term contract running for 7 months and she admitted working for the entire period of the contract until 31/7/2021 when the contract expired.36.It was the Respondent’s submissions that the renewal of the contract was not automatic and depended on availability of donor funds, performance and it was solely at discretion of the organization. That article 5 of the contract provided that renewal was at the discretion of the employer. The Respondent relied on among other cases the case of Rajab Barasa & 4 others v Kenya Meat Commission(2021) eKLR to submit that fixed term contracts carry no expectation of renewal and that there was automatic termination of the contract by effluxion of time in fixed term contracts.37.The Respondent submitted that it gave the Claimant notice of the fact that her contract ending 31stJuly, 2021 would not be renewed as per the terms and conditions of employment contract contained in clauses 2.4 and 2.5 of the contract. That this vitiated any expectation, legitimate or otherwise that the contract would be renewed which is the only exception to the rule of termination of term contracts by effluxion of time. The Respondent relied on the case of Margaret A Ochieng v National Water Conservation & Pipeline Corporation(2014) eKLR on the said exceptions.38.The Respondent submitted that the said notice was issued procedurally as per the contract of employment and it did not raise inconsistencies and contradictions as alleged by the claimant. That its decision not to renew the contract was based on issues regarding the Claimant’s performance which were known to her in line with Section 45 of theEmployment Acton validity of termination.39.On the issue of whether the Claimant was aware of the reasons given in the letter of 30/4/2021 the Respondent submitted that the Claimant was aware since she admitted executing performance assessment appraisal document of December 2020. The issues of underperformance in the letter were well documented in the email exchanged between the parties. That parties were expected to sign the appraisal where the supervisor and the employee must have seen and discussed the assessment.40.It was the Respondent’s submissions that although the Claimant purported to state that although she signed the document she did not agree with it she did not adduce evidence to show she was coerced in to signing. That she voluntarily signed the appraisal after a meeting with her supervisors where the contents were discussed and the Claimant notified on areas she needed to improve. The Respondent invited the court to read the email before it which showed that the Claimant was aware of all the accusations.41.The Respondent submitted that although the Claimant’s counsel raised the issue of the email not being accompanied by certificate under section 106B(4) of theEvidence Actthe witness confirmed that he had serviced the computers which were free from viruses which guaranteed authenticity of the email as per the said Act Section 106B(2).42.The Respondent further submitted that it was not necessary to give reasons for the non- renewal of the contract; the Respondent gave the reasons in good faith and in adequate time to afford the Claimant chance to improve and aid her to be better in her further professional engagements and career. That the reasons were justified as per performance appraisal and email exchanged.43.On the issue of whether the Claimant was discriminated against by the Respondent the Respondent submitted that the Claimant did not prove this allegation by any shred of evidence. That she did not call or provide an independent evidence to prove this allegation. That the renewal of the contract was at the discretion of the board and there was no single letter by the Claimant challenging the 7-month contract extension. That she ought to have raised the issue of discrimination when the contract was given and not after serving the full term. The Respondent relied on the case of Samson Gwer & 5 Others v Kenya Medical Research Institute & 3 others(2020) eKLR on proof of the discrimination.44.The Respondent submitted that on the issue of training raised by the Claimant that the Claimant received training on her duties and her weakness could be remedied by her going back to class as it touched on her competence. The email by the Managing Director was questioning the Claimant why she did not attend the trainers meeting program. That the Claimant was never discriminated as she was treated equally as other employees when it came to trainings and work conditions.45.On the issue of if the prayers sought by the Claimant, the Respondent submitted that the Claimant was not terminated as her contract ended by effluxion of time. That the decision to renew was pegged on performance. The Claimant did not meet the expected standards necessitating the Respondent not to renew her contract. The Respondent relied on the case of Civil Appeal No. 18 of 2018 Transparency International Kenya V Teresa Carlo Omondi(2023) eKLR on there being no legitimate expectation once duration had lapsed in fixed term contracts.46.On the prayer for gratuity the Respondent relied on section 35 of theEmployment Actto submit that since it remitted NSSF and Pension scheme with CFC Life Assurance Limited the Claimant was not entitled to any service pay. The Respondent relied on the case of Kennedy Nyanguncha Omanga v Bob Morgan Services Limited(2013) eKLR.Determination47.20The court has reviewed and considered the pleadings by both parties and testimony by both parties and I have has come up with three main issues;a.Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminated or her contract terminated by effluxion of time.b.Whether the Claimant was discriminated against by the Respondent.c.Whether the Claimant is entitled to reliefs sought.Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminated or her contract terminated by effluxion of time.48.The Claimant alleged that she was terminated by the Respondent while her contract was still in force on grounds of poor performance. The Respondent on the other hand alleged that the Claimant’s contract was a fixed term contract and even the previous contracts renewed were fixed term contracts which expired and there was no legitimate expectation to renew them.49.The court notes that the Claimant’s contracts were fixed term contracts the last one being for seven months running from 1stJanuary,2021 to 31stJuly, 2021 the same was renewable at the option of the employer. Renewal depended on availability of donor funds as well as performance of the Claimant. Clause 5 of the contract provided as such and the Claimant admitted that her contracts were fixed term contracts during hearing. This goes in tandem with Section 10(3(c) which provides that;where the employment is not intended to be for an indefinite period, the period for which it is expected to continue or, if it is for a fixed term, the date when it is to end;50.This court in addition notes that the Claimant was notified on 30thApril, 2021 that her contract will not be renewed for the reasons of the poor performance.51.It is therefore clear that the Claimant served her full term of the contract up to 31stJuly,2021; was paid her final dues then decided it was unfair termination and filed this case. It is interesting why the Claimant chose not to challenge the intended termination when she got the termination notice in April; waited until she served the full term, was paid her final dues then she decided thereafter it was unfair termination.52.This court in the case of Esther Muthoni Wachira v Vice Chancelor University of Nairobi & University of Nairobi [2022] eKLR while relying on court of Appeal decision had this to say;In Registered Trustees Of The Presbyterian Church Of East Africa & Another Versus Ruth Gathoni Ngotho Kariuki 2017 EKLR ‘Bearing the foregoing in mind, we note that fixed term contracts carry no rights, obligations, or expectations beyond the date of expiry. Accordingly, any claim based after the expiry of the respondent’s contract ought not to have been maintained. This is in relation to the salary for the months of April up to 5thMay, 2010. Similarly, since the respondent’s contract came to an end by effluxion of time any claim for wrongful termination could not be maintained’53.In the case ofEast Africa Sea Food Limited v Mwazito (Appeal E013 of 2020) [2023] KEELRC 1257 (KLR) (20 April 2023) (Judgment) the court had this to say:-Whether to issue a fixed term contract or not is regulated under the provisions of Section 10(3) (c) of the Act. An employer is allowed the prerogative to employ an employee under a fixed term contract with a start and end date. the self-executing contract is lawful and valid in employment and labour relations. The Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 18 of 2018 Transparency International Kenya v Teresa Carlo Omondi [2023] eKLR held that a fixed-term employment contract does not create a legitimate expectation of renewal. Further, the non-renewal of fixed-term employment does not amount to unfair termination of employment warranting compensation. Section 10(3) (c) of the Act then lifts the obligation on an employer to explain reasons for termination of employment in fixed-term contract as the same lapse by effluxion of time without creating a right of legitimate expectation of renewal.54.In addition, in the case of Margaret A Ochieng v National Water Conservation& Pipeline Corporation [2014] eKLR the court while dealing with the question of whether there is automatic need for notice of renewal of a fixed-term contract held that;“Automatic renewal [of a fixed-term contract] would undermine the very purpose of the fixed-term contract, and then revert to indeterminate contracts of employment…Courts have upheld the principle that fixed-term contracts carry no expectancy of renewal, in a catena of judicial authorities…… The Court is persuaded that the Claim has no merit. The fixed term contract had its own in-built termination notice, in that the date of termination was advised to the Claimant on execution of the three-year contract in December2008. She knew termination would be upon the lapse of the three years in 2011 ...”55.In this case the Claimant’s contract terminated by effluxion of time and the Respondent was not bound to give the grounds of poor performance for failure to renew her contract. In any case the court has perused all the documents relied on by the parties herein and it is clear that the Claimant knew she was not performing as expected. Email and the appraisal for December 2020 are evidence of these.56.It is therefore clear that the Claimant was never terminated, the Respondent had no obligation to issue termination notice so long as it notified her in three months’ time that it will not be renewing her contract. The claimant was therefore not terminated but her contract ended by effluxion of time.Whether the Claimant was discriminated against by the Respondent.57.The Claimant alleged that she was the only one whose contract was extended for 7 months while the rest of employees in her rank had their contracts extended for three years. The Claimant did not adduce any evidence to support this allegation or call any witness like a fellow employee whose contract was extended for three years. It was also clear that the Claimant did not complain to the Respondent when her contract was renewed for seven months and only complained after serving full term.58.In the case ofGichuru v Package Insurance Brokers Ltd (Petition 36 of 2019) [2021] KESC 12 (KLR) (22 October 2021) Discrimination was explained as follows:“Discrimination was failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction could be found between those favoured and those not favoured. Not all cases of distinction amounted to discrimination. Discrimination could be said to have occurred where a person was treated differently from other persons who were in similar positions on the basis of one of the prohibited grounds like race, sex disability or due to unfair practice and without any objective and reasonable justification.”59.Equally, in Francis Njeru Kariuki v Crown Paints Kenya Limited [2022] eKLR it was held that:“According to the Court of Appeal in Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd & another v Gladys Muthoni & 20 others [2018] eKLR –“…Discrimination means affording different treatment to different persons attributable wholly or mainly to their descriptions … whereby persons of one such description are subjected to … restrictions to which persons of another description are not made subject or are accorded privileges or advantages which are not accorded to persons of another such description…”In the instant case, apart from stating that position of Business Development Manager was given to another person, the Claimant provided no factual basis for the allegation. It is the finding of the Court that the Claimant has not on a balance of probabilities established that he was discriminated.60.In this case the Claimant has therefore not discharged her burden of proof that she was discriminated against by the Respondent since it came out clear during oral hearing that she was trained to undertake her work well and the email attached by the Respondent show that she was the one not attending the trainings. She was the author of her own misfortunes to this extent.Whether the Claimant is entitled to reliefs sought61.The court has established that the Claimant was never terminated that her contract terminated by effluxion of time. She was notified of the intention not to renew her contract upon expiry. She was also paid her final dues which included her leave pay. The Claimant is therefore not entitled to any compensation for unfair termination. The claim in its entirety is therefore found without merit and is hereby dismissed with costs.62.It is so orderedDATED AT NAIROBI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024ABUODHA NELSON JORUMJUDGE",Kago v Inades Formation Kenya (Cause E953 of 2021) [2024] KEELRC 2179 (KLR) (6 September 2024) (Judgment),Cause E953 of 2021,"NJ Abuodha, J","September 6, 2024",

E132 of 2023.e.That this Honourable Tribunal dismisses the application as the orders sought are a blatant abuse of the process of the Tribunal.Analysis and Findings4.The parties in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal to the effect that the application was to be canvassed by way of written submissions duly filed their respective submissions that were adopted by the Tribunal on the 9thMay, 2024. The Tribunal has considered and has been appropriately guided by the purport of the submissions and the authorities cited therein in arriving at its findings hereinafter.5.The Tribunal’s jurisdiction for the enlargement of time in the commencement of an appeal process is found under Section 13(2) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actwhich provides as thus:-“(3)The Tribunal may, upon application in writing, extend the time for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).(4)An extension under subsection (3) may be granted owing to absence from Kenya, or sickness, or other reasonable cause that may have prevented the applicant from giving notice of appeal within the specified period.”6.The Tribunal is enjoined to determine the length and reason for the delay when considering an application for the extension of time to appeal out of time. The power to extend is discretionary and unfettered but the same must be exercised judiciously.7.In the instant case, however, the Respondent raised an issue for the Tribunal to determine. This was whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant the prayers sought in the application.8.The Tribunal will therefore pronounce itself on the issue of jurisdiction before any other issue.9.The Appellant contended that by virtue of the Judgment issued by the Tribunal on the 5thApril, 2024, the effect of the same was to “strike out” its Appeal and not to “dismiss” it. That it was the intention of the Tribunal to allow the Appellant to regularise its Appeal so that it is properly before the Tribunal.10.The Respondent on the other hand was of the position that the Judgment issued by the Tribunal dated the 5thApril, 2024 rendered the Tribunal  functus officio as the present matter has already been finalised.11.In the nucleaus of this matter is the difference in the meaning between “Striking out” and “dismissing” of pleadings. The courts have widely pronounced themselves on this issue.12.In the case of Enock Kirao Muhanji v Hamid Abdalla Mbarak [2013] eKLR:-“It is true… that when a suit is dismissed, one might not be allowed to file a fresh suit unlike in a situation where a suit has been struck out.The words “dismissed” and struck out” are terms of art and are not supposed to be used interchangeably in a Ruling or Judgment. However, more often than not, the terms are used interchangeably by the litigants and the courts.It is therefore incumbent that when the court is called upon… to determine whether a party can file a fresh suit after the first one has been dismissed or struck court, the court should look at the circumstances of each case to arrive at a decision. The mere fact that the trial court uses the words “dismissed” does not expressly mean that a fresh suit cannot be filed if indeed the court meant that the suit should have been “struck out” so as to allow a party to file a fresh suit.” (Emphasis Added)13.Having gleaned through the documents filed by the parties and the embattled Judgment, and given the fact that the issue of time was not brought up by the Respondent in the later case, the Tribunal acknowledges that the Judgment had the effect of merely “striking out” the appeal and not to dismiss it. To that end, the Tribunal finds that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter14.Given the foregoing, the Tribunal will now delve into the substantive issues brought up in the instant application.15.In determining whether to extend time, the Tribunal was guided by the court in Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR, where the learned Judge quoted Sir Thomas Bingham M R in Costellow V Somerset County Council (1993)1 All ER 952 where he stated that:-“The first principle is that the rules of court and the associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote expeditious dispatch of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of a procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate…. Further, an extension of time is an indulgence from the court by a party in default. He is not entitled to an extension. He has no reasonable or legitimate expectation of receiving one. His only reasonable or legitimate expectation is that the discretion relevant to his application to extend time will be exercised judicially in accordance with established principles of what is fair and reasonable. In those circumstances, it is incumbent on the applicant for an extension of time to provide the court with a full, honest and acceptable explanation of the reasons for the delay. He cannot reasonably expect the discretion to be exercised in his favour, as a defaulter, unless he provides an explanation for the default.”16.On the criteria of the issues to be considered when granting an extension to file an appeal out of time, the Tribunal referred to the case of Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591 where the Court laid a hierarchy of factors to consider when it stated that:-“an applicant must now show, in descending scale of importance, the following factors: - a) That there is merit in his appeal. b) That the extension of time to institute and/or file the appeal will not cause undue prejudice to the respondent; and c) That the delay has not been inordinate.”17.The Tribunal, guided by the principles set out in Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591, Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR and Section 13 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, 2013 used the following criteria to consider the application.a.Whether the appeal is merited.b.Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay.c.Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted.a.          Whether the Appeal is merited?18.The Tribunal examined whether the actions complained of by the Applicant were merited and whether there was an arguable appeal before the Tribunal or the appeal was frivolous to the extent that it would only result in a waste of the Tribunal’s time.19.An appeal being merited does not mean that it should necessarily succeed but rather it is arguable. The Tribunal was guided by the findings of the court in Kenya Commercial Bank Limited Vs Nicholas Ombija (2009) eKLR where it was held that:-“an arguable appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court.”20.The Appellant simultaneously with the filing of this application filed a Memorandum of Appeal and the Statement of Facts which challenged the Respondent’s objection decision dated 16thFebruary, 2023 with regard to the additional VAT assessment that was based on a variance between the income tax returns and the VAT returns filed by the Appellant.21.A perusal of both the Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts disclose some material legal and factual issues that call for an appropriate determination of the Appeal on its proper merits. To that extent the Appellant is deserving of an opportunity to canvass its Appeal before the Tribunal.b.        Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?22.The Appellant brought an appeal to the Tribunal under TAT Appeal No. E132 of 2023 dated 20thMarch 2023 filed on 16thApril, 2023. This was replied to by the Respondent with the appeal being dispensed with subsequent to a full hearing.23.The Tribunal pronounced itself by acknowledging that it lacks jurisdiction since the Appellant brought the Appeal 47 days out of time. The effect was that the Tribunal struck out the pleadings for lack of jurisdiction.24.The Appellant thus brought the instant application seeking enlargement of time and requesting the Tribunal to allow it to file its Appeal out of time.25.Given that the Appellant filed the Appeal, that was struck out, as soon as it was aware of the objection decision, and that the current application was filed after the Judgment was rendered, the Tribunal finds that there was no undue delay on the part of the Appellant.26.In considering what constitutes as a reasonable reason for the delay, the court in Balwant Singh v Jagdish Singh & Ors (Civil Appeal No.1166 of 2006), held that:-“The test is whether or not a cause is sufficient to see whether it could have been avoided by the party by the exercise of due care and attention”.27.The Appellant contended that the reason it was delayed from lodging an appeal on time was due to an inadvertent error on the part of its representation in the dispute.28.The Tribunal finds the explanation and reasons raised by the Appellant as to the cause for the delay on its part in commencing the appeal process to be plausible and reasonable in all possible probabilities as sins of a professional should not be unduly visited upon their clients.c.        Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted.29.The Respondent did not demonstrate to the Tribunal how it would suffer prejudice if the extension of time is granted.30.The Appellant's only hope for justice lies in an appeal to the Tribunal. Thus, the Appellant argued that it would suffer prejudice if it is not granted leave to file its appeal considering that the amount of money claimed is of a significant amount which would lead to failure by the Appellant to pay wages, taxes, and conduct business normally.31.The Tribunal is thus compelled to agree with the Appellant in its argument that the Respondent would otherwise still collect the taxes together with penalties and interest should the Appellant be found to be at fault. The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Respondent will not suffer prejudice if the extension is granted.32.The Appellant has in the circumstances met the statutory and judicially established threshold for the grant of application for the enlargement of time to file an appeal.Disposition33.On the basis of the foregoing analysis the application is merited and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:-a.The application be and is hereby allowed.b.The Appellant be and is hereby granted leave to file an appeal out of time.c.The Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents filed on the 8thApril, 2024 be and are hereby deemed as duly filed and served.d.The Respondent to file and serve its Statement of Facts within Thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of this Ruling.e.No orders as to costs.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAYOF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -  CHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

The summons were issued on 26thAugust, 2024 requiring that the Acting Inspector General appear in court on 3rdSeptember, 2024 over alleged abduction of three persons (2nd– 4thpetitioners) whose whereabouts are unknown since 19thAugust, 2024 in what the petitioner describes to be the actions of agents of 1stRespondent.3.The Acting Inspector General (1stRespondent) has not availed himself as directed and has instead sent his representative, the Deputy Inspector General of Police to appear on his behalf.4.On 5thSeptember, 2024, M/s Mwangi for the Inspector General pleaded with the court stating as follows:-“The Inspector General has not said he is not coming, he is requesting for another date because it is our position that the 2nd-4thpetitioners are not with the police. The Inspector General is requesting another date to appear because we had thought his officers would explain.The Inspector General is requesting another date to appear in court (after holding brief consultation) the Inspector General will come on Monday 9thSeptember, 2024.The officers of Inspector General are here and have confirmed his availability of Monday considering his work and duties.”5.In spite of very stiff opposition from petitioners’ side, the court after the Inspector General skipped the attendance at 3.00 p.m. which the time the court had reluctantly extended from 10.00 a.m. on the 5thSeptember, 2024 further extended the matter to Monday 9thSeptember, 2024, hesitantly noting as follows:“The stream of reasons and excuses by the Inspector General of Police are definitely bound to run out. To proceed at this juncture and hastily make and finding of contempt of court may be seen as premature in a grave matter of contempt of court which is a form of a criminal sanction being an offence against the administration of Justice. Our Constitution requires a high threshold for criminal matters. Reluctantly, the reasons for non-attendance today must thus be considered….. It is thus necessary that I postpone these proceedings to Monday 9thSeptember, 2024. The Inspector General having earlier indicated his availability on this particular day should have no further excuse but to comply and attend court physically at 10.00 a.m. so that this court can put this matter to an end…”6.In spite of what transpired on 5thSeptember, 2024 as indicated above, we are back to the same spot today. As of 5thSeptember, 2024 it was evident that the court had directed the inspector General to attend the court and it was clear to the respondents that delegation had been declined by the court.7.We are now back to the stream of excuses that the court had clearly noted for snubbing the summons by the Head of Police who should be explaining to the court whether or not the Kenyans in question are in the hands of police and if not, what is being done to get to the bottom of the whole matter.8.The court appreciates that the Inspector General of Police can delegate and this is possible in law. It also appreciates the fact the Deputy Inspector General of Police is a High Ranking Position.9.However, the matter at hand may not practically be dealt with by way of delegation anymore considering that the refusals to obey summons have since mutated to what the court considers to be contemptuous conduct on the part of 1stRespondent which is now personal.10.What simply the Acting Inspector General has displayed is the attitude that he is either too busy to be bothered by court orders even when they are matters affecting life and safety of persons he is required to protect.11.A failure to appear in court pursuant to a duly issued summons amounts to direct contempt of court particularly where an opportunity to appear has been extended and ignored.12.The willful disobedience undermines not only the authority of the court but the supremacy of the law and administration of justice generally. Such attitude affects the rule of law and makes the citizens vulnerable knowing that the law cannot protect them. It may be that same feeling that the petitioners in this petition now feel considering the conduct of the 1stRespondent so far.13.The Constitution of this country has given the court the mandate to uphold and enforce it on behalf of Kenyans.14.The Inspector General of Police is a State Officer established under Article 245 (1) of the Constitution. He is appointed under Article 245(2) and bestowed with a mandate to exercise independent command of National Police Service any other functions prescribed by National Legislation.15.Article 74 of the Constitution provides that prior to assuming office, State Officers must take oath of office. It provides: -“Before assuming State Office, Acting in State Office, or performing any functions of a State office, a person shall take and subscribe the oath or affirmation of office, in the matter prescribed in the Third Schedule or under an Act of Parliament…”16.The oaths taken by State officer, such as the 1stRespondent have one common denominator:“They swear allegiance to the Constitution.”17.This shows the exalted place the Constitution occupies in assuring the public that state/public officers who yield public power will always be guided by the Constitutional values and principles in exercising it.18.That they will respect the rule of law, human rights, be accountable and act professionally towards the public.19.It would require them to abide by the orders of the court as the guardian of the Constitution and Constitutional order.20.Yet, it is now becoming common place that individuals who take and subscribe to the oath of office and assume public office no longer abide by the Constitution and are treating court orders with outright abandonment.21.The Bill of Rights that is supposed to safeguard the rights of Kenyans no longer matters to some.22.It is the responsibility of this court to restore confidence in the people of Kenya by holding these persons accountable, however mighty. It may come at considerable cost but this must be done. The court has a responsibility to punish deliberate actions that undermine the Constitution and its authority. The faith and trust of Kenyans in the rule of law of which they have suffered for a far too long agitating for cannot be taken for granted and be diluted through acts of impunity.23.The Constitution at Article 247 (7) (a) does, among others, acknowledge that Inspector General can even be removed for violation of the Constitution subject to following the laid down procedure. It provides:The Inspector General may be removed from office:“Where there is serious violation of the Constitution or any other law”24.A deliberate refusal to abide by the court order/summons undermines the principle of rule of law under Article 10 (b) and the failure to attend court to explain the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the 3 petitioners undermines the principles of accountability by a Public Officer and institution he heads.25.Heads of institution must had been relied accountable for ensuring constitutional values and principles are adhered to particularly on matter of human right and the rule of law.26.The contemptuous conduct of the 1strespondent has held this court at ransom, it is no longer able to ascertain the truth of what might have happened to the three petitioners.27.It was held by the Court of Appeal in Dr. Fred Mating’i & Another Vs Miguna Miguna & 3 Others (2018) eKLR.“.. bold impunity, open defiance or cynical disregard for the authority of the court and the integrity of the Judicial System… cannot be countenanced and those hell bent on it will find neither help, not refuge and self-serving appeal to natural justice when that imprudent conduct threatens the very foundation of the rule of law..”28.It is my finding that the 1stRespondent (Acting Inspector General of Police) is guilty of contempt of court and the court ought to punish him accordingly.29.Further, the court would like to note that there has been unbecoming conduct by a Senior Police Officer, Former JPU Commandant Lazarus Opicho, now in the VVIP Protection Unit which the court considers as bordering on intimidation.30.I will thus order that Mr. Lazarus Opicho be and is hereby summoned to explain the conduct that included calling my bodyguard and driver trying to ascertain my whereabouts behind my back. I need to ascertain what were the reasons behind such an inquiry among other concerns.31.I reserve the sentencing together with the explanation by Lazarus Opicho for Friday, 13thSeptember, 2024.32.Having found the 1stRespondent (Acting Inspector General) guilty of contempt, the court is now free and ready to take the explanation provided by Deputy Inspector General since there is no more impediment to the hearing of the matter, the finding on contempt having been made after an opportunity to purge the contempt was extended but not taken.33.The court has no reason to decline to hear the Deputy Inspector General who is before the court so that this matter can be put to rest.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED IN OPEN COURT THIS 9THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.…………………………L N MUGAMBIJUDGE",Law Society of Kenya & 3 others v Inspector General of Police & 4 others (Petition E436 of 2024) [2024] KEHC 10566 (KLR) (9 September 2024) (Ruling),Petition E436 of 2024,"LN Mugambi, J","September 9, 2024",

      [2024] KEHC 10565 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at KakamegaSuccession Cause 67 of 1985SC Chirchir, JAugust 26, 2024IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF MILIKAU SAWANGA- (DECEASED)BetweenPeter K SawangaPetitionerandRichard Milikau AnyikaObjectorRuling1.Through the summons dated 24thApril 2024, the Objector/ Applicant sought the intervention of this court for the following orders;1.(Spent)2.(spent)3.That the honourable court be pleased to review and or set aside the orders issued on the 4thday of March 2023;4.That an order of prohibition to be ordered to be registered against the parcel of land known as Butsotso / Ingotse/1620 pending the hearing and final determination of this application.5.That the grant issued to the petitioner herein Peter K.sawanga be revoked and a fresh grant be issued to the applicant herein, Richard Milikau Anyika6.The new administrator to be ordered comply with the orders issued by the court on the 26thday of July 2019.7.That the petitioner/ Respondent be condememed to provide costs.Through an order issued on 26thApril 2023, this court allowed temporary stay pending the hearing and determination of the application and the matter was fixed for interpartes hearing on 10thMay 2023.The Applicant’s case2.The application is supported by an affidavit sworn by the applicant and on the grounds appearing on the face of the Application.3.The Applicant states that he got news of his impending eviction from the land he resides in and this got him concerned because as far as knew, the Petitioner was yet to complete the Administration of the Estate .4.He further states that it was only upon the perusal of the court file by his Advocate, that he found out that his name has been removed from the list of beneficiaries; that the Respondent approached court in the name of rectification of the certificate of confirmation of Grant , but his real intention was to have his name removed from the list of beneficiaries.5.According to the applicant, he was never served with the Application dated 25/1/2023 which led to the removal of his name, and despite the courts direction to the respondent to serve other parties in the suit, these directions were not complied with.6.He further states that on 14/3/2023 when the aforesaid Application came up for interpartes hearing the Respondent misled the court on service, by informing the court that all the parties were present . The above allegations were not true, the Applicant states.7.It is further the Applicant’s case that in any event, the respondent has failed to comply with the court orders of 27thJuly 2019 directing him to complete the administration of the estate within 60 days from the date of the said order;that, consequently, the grant should be revoked on account of the respondent’s failure to diligently administer the Estate .The Respondent’s case8.Through his replying Affidavit dated 9thmay 2023 the Respondent opposes the Application. He avers their late father, the deceased in this cause, had three parcels of land being Butsotso /Ingotse/620,634 and 746.9.He further states that prior to their father’s demise, the applicant had been given a portion from parcel No. 746 ; that parcel No. 620 was shared out between 10 family members; that consequently the applicant was not entitled to any share.10.He states that the claim for revocation of the grant was malicious and is only aimed at delaying the implementation of the certificate of confirmation of Grant.11.The Application was canvassed by way of written submissions.Applicant’s submissions12.The Applicant reiterates the averments of the Affidavit in support and states that the distribution of the Estate ought to have been done in terms of the orders of Justice Waweru given in may 2001 as affirmed by the ruling of Justice Musyoka on 26thJuly 2019; that consequently the orders of amendment made on made on 14thmarch 2023 was done in error. That the amendment constituted an error on the face of the record warranting an order of review, he submits.Respondent’s submissions13.It is the respondent submissions that the Applicant was not a party to the suit and hence the reason he was not served with the hearing Notice.14.He submits that the applicant had already been allocated his share by their late father and that the whole purpose of the amendment / rectification of the grant was only due to some spelling error on the names of the beneficiaries.15.He insists that the objector was a stranger to the suit; that he has complied with the ruling by Hon. Justice Musyoka; and that he followed the court’s due process.Determination16.I have considered the Application , the parties’ Affidavits and submissions and am of the view that the issue to be determined is whether a review ought to be allowed; and whether there are any appropriate orders this court should make.17.Review is founded on Order 45 of the Civil procedure Rules and this order has been imported to thelaw of succession Actpursuant to rule 63 of the probate and Administration Rules.18.Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows; (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved-a.By a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; orb.By a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any additional sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.19.An applicant seeking orders of review must therefore meet any of the above requirements, that is :a)Discovery of new and important matter.b)Mistake or error on the face of the record.c)Other sufficient reasons.21.The Court of Appeal in the case National Bank of Kenya Ltd –v- Njau (1995-98) EA 249 held that: “A review may be granted whenever the court considers that it is necessary to correct an apparent error or omission on the part of the court. The error must be self-evident and should not require an elaborate argument to be established….”20.The Applicant’s case herein is that there was an error on the face of the record as the amendment of the certificate of confirmation of grant taken out pursuant to the orders of the court made on 24thApril 2023 left out his name as a beneficiary.21.A little background of what has transpired in this cause , and which is relevant to the current of Application, is necessary;- On 29thJune 1993 a certificate of confirmation of grant was issued , and an amended Grant was issued on 31stOctober 2001 pursuant to an order issued by Justice Waweru on 5/4/2001.22.The grant issued on the basis of Justice Waweru’s orders addressed the share of the applicant herein in Land parcel No.Butsoso/Ingotse/620 and determined that he was entitled to an acre from the said portion.23.In the Application dated 25thJanuary 2023, the Respondent sought for substitution of the beneficiaries and issuance of am Amended certificate. The Application reads as follows:a).This honourable court do substitute the beneficiaries Richard Omumia ( Deceased) with his son Mike Mururu Milikua and also substitute Wiki Milikua ( Deceased) with his son Joshua Anyika Omurunga.b).That this honorable court to amend the names of the beneficiaries on the certificate and issue an amended certificate bearing the names as follows:Peter K. Sawanga…………………3 acresPhiliph Siwanga Milikua…………2 acresMike Mururi Milikua……………..2 acresMorice Milikua Siwanga…………..2 acresZakayo Kwendo Milkua…………..2 acresErastus Mwanje Milikua…………...2 acresNikole Ndume Milikua…………….2 acresDatani Kimatsi Milikua…………….2 acresJoshua Anyika Omurunga………2 ½ acresAsuman Aloise Milkua…………..2 ½ acresc)That costs be in the cause.24.While seeking for the above stated orders, the Respondent represented to the court that the Certificate of confirmation due for amendment was the one issued on 29thJune 2023 ( paragraph 3 of his Affidavit). Under paragraph 6 of his affidavit, he provided the allocation as per the said certificate issued on 29thJune 1993. That grant of 29/6/1993 did not have the Applicant herein as a beneficiary.25.However the grant of 29thJune , 1993 had been cancelled and replaced with the one issued on 17thmay2001 and further amended on 31stOctober 2001. Thus the operating certificate of confirmation as at the time of the Respondent’s Application dated 25thJanuary 2023 was the one dated 31/10/2001. In that certificate dated 31/10/2001 the Applicant herein was entitled to 1 acre of the suit property as aforesaid. It is evident that in the Application dated 25thJanuary 2023, the name of the Applicant herein had been left out.26.It is further evident that the submission of a Grant that was no longer operational was deliberate and was meant to circumvent the orders of Justice waweru made of 9thOctober 2001 and the certificate of confirmation emanating therefrom.27.Nevertheless, I agree with the Applicant that to the extent that the certificate of confirmation of Grant that was purportedly placed before court no longer existed, that constituted an error on the face of the record.28.Further the respondent’s assertion that the Applicant did not deserve service is indicative of another act of defiance by the respondent . When the Respondent took the date for the hearing of his Application , he was directed to serve the Applicant herein. From his Affidavit he states that there was no need to serve as the Applicant herein was not a party to the suit.29.It is not disputed therefore that the Applicant herein was not served with the Application for substitution which, instructively, was orally presented to the court as one for rectification, and nothing was said about the removal of the Applicant from the list of beneficiaries.30.The certificate of confirmation presented to the court was equally a wrong as aforesaid .That constituted an error on the face of the record and the Application for review is warranted. Consequently the certificate issued on 14thmarch 2023 will be rectified as will I direct shortly hereafter.31.The Applicant has further sought that the Grant be revoked on account of the petitioner’s failure to complete the Administration of the Estate.32.This succession cause began its journey in march 1985. It is now on its thirty- eighth year and 5 months of its journey. Two previous judges have expressed their concerns about the delay and gave directions on the fast-tracking on the transmission of the properties. Those directions have been ignored.33.It is clearly evident that the petitioner has no regard for court orders, if the same do not meet his expectation . Indeed his response to the Application shows that he is still dissatisfied with the court orders of 15thOctober 1997, which included the Applicant as the respondent. His response to the present Application is also evasive on the question of why the Applicant was left out.34.I therefore agree with the Applicant that the Petitoner is not keen in distributing the estate. However this matter has taken too long in the courts and am alive to the fact that the beneficiaries are keen to make independent and perhaps effective economic use of their share of the land. However removal of the petitioner from Administration at this stage will only prolong the completion of transmission process.35.Consequently and for the last time , the petitioner is given another 90 days to complete the transmission process.36.This court has taken note of the mischief, back- stabbing ( by both parties) , and defiance of court orders that has characterised this matter. It is partly because of such antics that the case has been on, for the last 38 years. The parties herein are hereby reminded that the court is not a theatre for their belligerence . Their actions constitute an abuse and misuse of the court process .37.In the end , I hereby make the following orders:a).The court orders of 14thmarch 2023 are hereby set aside and the Rectified certificate of confirmation of Grant rectified on 14thmarch 2023 is hereby cancelled.b).The Amended certificate of confirmation of grant dated 31stOctober 2001 is hereby further amended limited to substituting the beneficiary Richard Omumia, with Mike Mururi Milikau, and beneficiary Wiki Milikua, with Joshua Anyika Omurunga.c).A further Amended certificate of confirmation of Grant in terms of paragraph (b) hereof to issue for with.c).The Respondent is hereby directed to complete the Transmission of the property to the beneficiaries within 90 days from the date of this Ruling.e).In default of Paragraph (c ) above, the Grant of letters of Administration herein shall automatically stand revoked, and the file shall be closed .f).Each party to meet their own costs.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI, VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS, THIS 26THDAY OF AUGUST 2024.S.

She has attached a death certificate for the said Keya Okwoma and marked it as “ZAN 1”4.She further states that she has been issued with a limited grant of letters of administration Ad litem in respect of the Estate of the late keya. A limited grant adlitem is attached to the Application and marked “ZAN 2” .5.It is further her case that the respondents have encroached on her late husband’s portion of the land ; that she has come under threats whenever she attempts to make use of her family’s portion of land and she fears for her life , security and safety of her children.6.She prays that the court issue an injunction for her own safety and that the OCS be assigned to supervise the orders issued.The Respondent’s case7.In his replying affidavit dated 3rdJune 2023, the 1strespondent denied the allegations made by the applicant and avers that the sale of 4 acres to the 2ndto 6threspondents was upon the mutual Agreement of the Applicant’s late husband and himself; that the 2nd-6threspondent had already taken actual possession of the said portion and had already planted trees ; that the succession process was simply to formalize the sale.8.He denied the allegations by the applicant that she has been attacked by the 2nd-6threspondent, stating that he lives with them and has not witnessed any violence or threats directed at the Applicant. He avers that the activities of the respondent are within the marked boundary that had been agreed upon, and that the application for injunction was unwarranted in the circumstances.9.The Application proceeded by way of written submissions.Applicant’s submissions10.It is the Applicant’s submission that the respondents have encroached on her portion of land and are now cultivating the 5 acres instead of the 4 acres that they had acquired. She submits that this constitutes intermeddling of the deceased’s estate. Reliance has been placed in the case of Re estate of John Mulwa Nzioki (deceased) 2021 eKLR andRepublic vs. Chairman Machakos Land disputes Tribunal & others Ex parte Late Mutheke Ndeti & others Machakos HCMA No. 252 of 2006.11.She further submits that this court has powers to issue injunctive orders for purposes of preservation of the deceased’s Estate. To buttress her submissions in this regard, she has relied on the case ofEdema & 2 others vs. Edema & 5 others ( miscellaneous succession cause E001 of 2022) KEHC 9960 (KLR) as well as the case of Re estate of Kitur Chepsungulegei ( deceased) (2021) e KLR.12.It is her prayer that the court order the respondent to maintain a status quo and not harass the applicant pending the determination of the appeal.Respondents’ submissions13.The Respondents have given a brief background to the present Application and submit that they are not opposed to the substitution of the deceased by the Applicant herein.14.On the prayer for injunction, the respondent have termed the Application ambiguous and lacking on the particulars. They have queried for instance, the property which forms the subject matter of the Application; To the respondents , it is not clear if the Applicant is referring to the whole of Title no. Marama/ shikunga/ 295 , or a portion thereof. The respondents submit that the ambiguity was deliberate; and was meant to prejudice their response.15.On the prayer for temporary injunction, the respondents submit the applicant has not satisfied the requirements for the granting of the orders of injunction such as if refusal of granting the order will render the substantive appeal nugatory.16.The respondent further submit that allowing prayer 3 of the Application will contradict the orders of the certificate of the confirmation of the grant and that it would be like issuance of an eviction order, a move would render them homeless.Determination17.The main issue for determination is whether the applicant has made out a case for grant of the injunctive orders sought.18.The law on granting of interlocutory injunctions is set out under order 40(1) (a) and (b) of the Civil Procedure Rules . It provides as follows:“Where in any suit it is proved by affidavit or otherwise—(a)That any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree; or(b)That the defendant threatens or intends to remove or dispose of his property in circumstances affording reasonable probability that the plaintiff will or may be obstructed or delayed in the execution of any decree that may be passed against the defendant in the suit, the court may by order grant a temporary injunction to restrain such act, or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the wasting, damaging, alienation, sale, removal, or disposition of the property as the court thinks fit until the disposal of the suit or until further.""19.Further the Applicant must satisfy the conditions set out in the celebrated case of Giella v Cassman Brown Co Ltd (1973) E.A 358 , that is , the Applicant must show:(i)that he has a prima facie case with probability of success;(ii)that he will suffer irreparable loss that cannot be adequately compensated by damages: or(iii)That the balance of convenience is in his favour.20.Further Section 47 of theLaw of Succession Actvests the court with wide discretion in granting protective powers for purposes of safeguarding the estate of a deceased person. The section provides as follows:“The High Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any application and determine any dispute under this Act and to pronounce such decrees and make such orders therein as may be expedient.”21.In the case of re Estate of Jeremiah Ngiri Kibati (Deceased) [2019] eKLR and Re Estate of Elijah Ngari (Deceased) [2019] eKLR, the court in dealing with the issue of issuance of conservatory orders in succession matters cited with approval the decision of this court in Japhet Kaimenyi M’ndatho v M’ndatho M’mbwiria [2012] eKLR in which it was held that the Applicant has to satisfy the conditions that:“( a.)That the suit property is at the risk of being disposed of or alienated or transferred to the detriment of the applicant unless Preservatory orders of inhibition are issued.(b).That the refusal to grant orders of inhibition would render the applicant’s suit nugatory.( c.)That the applicant has arguable case.”22.Similarly, In the Matter of the Estate of Paulo Kiplagat Boiwo (Deceased) (2012) eKLR, the court while affirming that preservatory orders are similar to injunctive orders, noted that applicants have to abide by the conditions set out in the case of Giella vs Cassman Brown ( supra) namely the applicant must make out a prima facie case and show that they will suffer irreparable loss ,which loss cannot be compensated by damages and lastly that the balance of convenience should tilt in their favour where doubt exists.23.It is the Applicant’s duty to demonstrate that she meets the conditions set out under Rule 40(1) of the civil procedure Rules and in above cited decisions.24.The applicant has sought for an injunction to bar the respondents from interfering with her peaceful enjoyment of the suit property ( Emphasis added).The question that naturally and immediately come to mind is which suit property?25.I have gone through the grounds appearing in the face of the Application and carefully read through the supporting Affidavit and am unable to find the identity of the suit property. The Applicant has not made any effort to relate her prayers to a particular property.26.A perusal of the Memorandum of Appeal show that there are 2 properties that form the subject matter of the Appeal, that is Title No. Marama / Shikunga/295 and Marama / Shikunga/1189. This appear on paragraph 2 of the memorandum of Appeal. However there is nothing on ground No. 2 of the memorandum of Appeal that would make one conclude that, that was the property that the Applicant was referring to in prayer 3 of her Application.27.For one to decipher which suit property the Applicant is referring to or a portion of which property , one has to go through the entire proceedings of the lower court.28.I have gone through the lower proceedings and I could make a correct guess on which property the Applicant was referring to . I have also noted that the respondent’s Advocate too has painstakingly tried to figure out which property the Applicant was referring to .29.However , it is not the work of this court or the opposite party in a suit to try and read the mind of the Applicant. It is the Applicant who moved the court and it was her duty to clearly state her prayers. I note that the Applicant is duly represented, and there is no conceivable reason why such an application, so wanting in particulars, was filed. Further even if this court was to grant prayer 3 of the Application , how will such an order, wanting of the particulars of the property being referred to, be enforced?30.On this ground alone am inclined to dismiss this Application .31.However , moving on to the other grounds in support of the Application, the Applicant has complained of encroachment on her portion of the property by the respondents, but there is no evidence at all that such interference has taken place. There is no evidence of the alleged cultivation , which could have been easily demonstrated by use of photographs ,for instance .32.The Applicant has further stated that her life has been threatened and cites an incident in which a panga was brandished at her. However evidence of such an incident ,like a report filed with the police, has not been availed.33.In a nutshell, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that she has a premafacie case with a portability of success to warrant the orders of injunction.34.The prayer for substitution is not opposed and is warranted in any event .35.In conclusion I hereby proceed to make the following orders:a).Keya Okwoma is hereby substituted by Zainar Anyande Namisi in Butere succession cause No. 158 of 2002 and on this Appeal.b).The prayer for injunction is hereby dismissed.c).Each party to meet their own costsDATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI, VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS, THIS 26THDAY OF AUGUST 2024.S.CHIRCHIRJUDGEIn the presence of :Godwin- Court AssistantMr. Wanyanga for the ApplicantMr. Mogi for the 2ndto 6thRespondents.",In re Estate of the Late Okwoma Keya (Deceaaed) (Succession Appeal 1 of 2020) [2024] KEHC 10564 (KLR) (26 August 2024) (Ruling),Succession Appeal 1 of 2020,"SC Chirchir, J","August 26, 2024",

      [2024] KETAT 1239 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalTax Appeal E498 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, E Ng'ang'a, Jephthah Njagi & G Ogaga, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenFalcon Road Contractors LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant is a limited liability company duly incorporated in Kenya under theCompanies Act. Its main business is in construction services.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya. The Kenya Revenue Authority (“KRA”) is an agency of the Government of Kenya for assessing, collecting, and accounting for all revenue.3.On 9thSeptember 2022, the Respondent issued the Appellant with additional tax assessments through iTax for VAT of Kshs. 516,996.26 for July 2022.4.The Appellant lodged an objection application on 27thJanuary 2023 and the Respondent issued a late objection rejection decision on 8thFebruary 2023.5.Being dissatisfied with the decision, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 22ndAugust 2023.The Appeal6.The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as deduced from the Memorandum of Appeal dated and filed on 22ndAugust 2023: -a.That the Respondent erred in its decision to issue the Appellant with additional tax assessment in respect of VAT totaling 516,996.26.b.That the Respondent issued an assessment for the tax amount based on the assumption that the suppliers did not make the declarations as required and thus created a mismatch on the same. The Respondent went ahead and disallowed this input VAT.c.That the purchases were not fictitious as purported by the Commissioner.d.That the purchases made as used in the input VAT were done and thus should be allowed as proof of payments.Appellant’s Case7.The Appellant’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 22ndAugust 2023 wherein the Appellant reiterated the chronology of events as provided in the background.8.Seeing as the Appellant did not file its submissions with the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall rely on the pleadings available to it and the accompanying documents to determine the totality of the Appellant’s case.Appellant’s prayers9.The Appellant prayed for orders that:a.The Commissioner be compelled to allow such input VAT as earlier declared in the Appellant’s original returns.b.The assessments thereof be vacated.Respondent’s Case10.The Respondent’s case is premised on the following documents:a.Preliminary Objection dated and filed on 3rdNovember 2023;b.Its Statement of Facts dated 3rdNovember 2023 and filed on 7thNovember 2023 and;c.Its Written Submissions dated 4thMarch 2024 and filed on 6thMarch 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.11.The Respondent stated that the Appellant preferred to lodge its appeal against the Respondent’s invalidation notice which is not an appealable decision contrary to Sections 51 and 52 of theTax Procedures Act.12.The Respondent contended that it is empowered by Section 31 of theTax Procedures Actto amend the Appellant’s self-assessment returns based on available information and to the best of the Respondent’s judgment.13.The Respondent averred that the assessment was based on unsupported VAT input claims for the period of July 2022.14.The Respondent stated that it wrote to the Appellant on 31stJanuary 2023 requesting it to provide its reason for the late objection and documentary evidence in support of its late application.15.The Respondent maintained that the Appellant’s objection application was not in line with Section 51(6) of theTax Procedures Actsince the Appellant failed to provide its reasons for the late objection application, documentary evidence of the same and its grounds of Objection.16.The Respondent asserted that since it could not review the Appellant’s Objection application by operation of the law it proceeded to invalidate the Appellant’s Objection application on 8thFebruary 2023.17.The Respondent reiterated that being dissatisfied with the Respondent's invalidation notice, the Appellant preferred to lodge an Appeal at the Tribunal contrary to Sections 51 and 52 of theTax Procedures Act.18.The Respondent contended that it is allowed to make additional assessments based on the available information to the best of its judgment pursuant to Section 31 of theTax Procedures Actand that it is allowed by Section 24(2) of theTax Procedures Actto assess a taxpayer’s liability using any information available to it.19.The Respondent relied on Sections 51(12) and 52 of theTax Procedures Actand averred that the Appellant is challenging an invalidation notice issued under Section 51(7A) of theTax Procedures Actwhich is not an appealable decision hence the Tribunal is not the proper forum for the adjudication of this matter.20.The Respondent added that the Kenyan tax system is a self-assessment system where a taxpayer assesses itself and makes payments to KRA and all one requires is to acquire a KRA PIN and access the iTax system for one to file its returns for income tax purposes.21.The Respondent stated that the Appellant was accorded the opportunity to file its returns and only thereafter did the Respondent proceed under Section 31 of theTax Procedures Actto review the Appellant’s self-assessment returns and upon conclusion of the review it was discovered that there were some areas where there were omissions.22.The Respondent averred that in line with Article 47 ofthe Constitutionand Section 51 of theTax Procedures Actengaged the Appellant at every stage of the process.23.The Respondent contended that according to Section 59 of theTax Procedures Act, the onus is on the Appellant to produce records to obtain full information regarding the Appellant’s tax liability.24.The Respondent reiterated that Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actand Section 56 of theTax Procedures Actimpose the burden of proof on the taxpayer to prove that an assessment is excessive or a tax decision is incorrect.25.On Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this Appeal the Respondent submitted that the Appellant is challenging an invalidation notice issued under Section 51(7A) of theTax Procedures Actwhich is not an appealable decision.26.The Respondent relied on the case ofCommissioner of Investigation & Enforcement v Vys t/a Rocon Enterprises (Income Tax Appeal E144 of 2021) [2022] KEHC 16027 (KLR) (Commercial and Tax) (25thNovember 2022) (Judgment) and submitted that the Appellant is challenging a decision that is not an appealable decision and hence is not even supposed to be before this Tribunal for determination as the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain the same.27.The Respondent also cited the case of Owners of Motor Vessel “Lilian S” v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd (1989) eKLR.28.On whether the Respondent was right in rejecting the Appellant’s objection the Respondent cited Sections 24(2) and 31(1) of theTax Procedures Actand submitted that it raised additional assessments on 9thSeptember 2022 pursuant to the law.29.The Respondent reiterated that the Appellant objected to notice of objection dated 27thJanuary 2023 and the Respondent requested the Appellant to provide evidence in support of its late Objection application vide email on 31stJanuary 2023.30.The Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to provide the required documents and therefore the Respondent issued the Appellant with late objection notices for the VAT assessments rejecting the Appellant’s notice of objection applications for failure to avail documents to support the applications.31.The Respondent relied on Section 17(3) of the VAT Act, Section 15 of theIncome Tax Actas well as Sections 51(2)(3) and Section 56(1) of theTax Procedures Actand maintained that the Appellant failed to discharge its evidential burden of proof under Section 107 of theEvidence Actin demonstrating that the Respondent’s assessment was incorrect or excessive.32.The Respondent further relied on Section 97(a) of theTax Procedures Act, 2015 and asserted that the Appellant’s under-declaration constitutes an offense of knowingly omitting from its tax returns an amount that should have been included contrary to the law.33.The Respondent cited the cases of Nairobi TAT No. 25 of 2016 Family Signature Limited v The Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement; and the case of TAT No. 28 of 2018 Joycott General Contractors Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority and submitted that although the law recognizes the self-assessment regime, the Respondent is empowered by Section 31 of theTax Procedures Actto amend such assessment.Respondent’s prayers34.The Respondent prayed for the Tribunal to find that:a.The Appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed.b.The Invalidation notice dated 8thFebruary 2023 be upheld.c.The Respondent be awarded costs of the Appeal.Issues for Determination35.The Tribunal having evaluated the pleadings and submissions of the parties is of the view that the following two issues that call for its determination;a.Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the Appeal.b.Whether the Respondent was right in rejecting the Appellant’s Late Objection Application.Analysis and Findings36.The Tribunal having determined the issues falling for its determination proceeds to analyse the same as hereunder.a. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the Appeal.37.The Respondent raised a Preliminary Objection dated 3rdNovember 2023 on grounds that the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to hear this Appeal as the decision issued under Section 51(7A) of theTax Procedures Act, that is the subject of this Appeal, is not an appealable decision.38.The Tribunal, therefore, seeks to determine whether the Appeal is based on an appealable decision, which would confirm whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the Appeal.39.The Tribunal observes that its jurisdiction is provided in Section 3 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act(TAT Act) which states as thus: -“There is established a Tribunal to be known as the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear appeals filed against any tax decision made by the Commissioner.”40.The TAT Act does not define the term tax decision. However, the term is defined in the TPA, under Section 3 where it means: -““tax decision” means—(a)an assessment;(b)a determination under section 17(2) of the amount of tax payable or that will become payable by a taxpayer;(c)a determination of the amount that a tax representative, appointed person, director or controlling member is liable for under sections 15, 17, and 18;(d)a decision on an application by a self-assessment taxpayer under section 31(2);(e)a refund decision;(f)a decision under section 48 requiring repayment of a refund; or(g)a demand for a penalty.41.Section 3 of the TPA defines appealable decision as: -““appealable decision” means an objection decision and any other decision made under a tax law other than—(a)a tax decision; or(b)a decision made in the course of making a tax decision;”42.The Tribunal opines that a taxpayer who wishes to dispute a decision by the Commissioner must first exhaust remedies available under a tax law before seeking remedies under another law. Section 51 (1) of the TPA limits the type of decisions whose remedies can be sought by way of objection; these are, tax decisions, as listed above. Should the Commissioner partially or wholly reject the objection, the taxpayer can appeal the objection decision to the Tribunal. These dispute resolution steps embody the doctrine of exhaustion.43.In addition, a decision made in the course of making a tax decision means a decision which the Commissioner makes during the making of a tax decision. These types of decisions are in the purview of the administrative role of the Commissioner. Section 3 of the TPA expressly excludes decisions made during the making of a tax decision from the meaning of appealable decisions.44.Section 51 (1) of the TPA provides that: -“A taxpayer who wishes to dispute a tax decision shall first lodge an objection against that tax decision under this section before proceeding under any other written law.”45.The Tribunal notes that Section 51 (1) of the TPA as read together with the meaning of appealable decision under Section 3 of the TPA elaborates the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. These provisions of the TPA uphold the doctrine of exhaustion and demonstrate that all other decisions of the Commissioner, that are not tax decisions or decisions made in the course of making a tax decision, are appealable decisions.46.Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that a late objection rejection decision is an appealable decision. Therefore, the Appellant was justified in appealing the decision under Section 52 of the TPA in accordance with the TAT Act.47.Being that the decision appealed by the Appellant was an appealable decision, the Tribunal finds that it has the jurisdiction to hear and determine the Appeal.b. Whether the Respondent was right in rejecting the Appellant’s Late Objection Application48.The Appellant objected the tax assessments dated 9thSeptember 2022 vide notices of objection dated 27thJanuary 2023.49.The Respondent averred that it requested the Appellant to provide evidence in support of its late objection application vide an email on 31stJanuary 2023 but the Appellant failed to provide the required documents and therefore the Respondent issued the Appellant with late objection rejection notices on 8thFebruary 2023.50.Section 51(2) of theTax Procedures Actprovides the timelines within which a taxpayer ought to object to a disputed tax decision. The provision states that:-“A taxpayer who disputes a tax decision may lodge a notice of objection to the decision, in writing, with the Commissioner within thirty days of being notified of the decision.”51.The timelines for objecting to tax assessments are clearly set in the law, and all taxpayers are liable to comply with the timelines, save for when unavoidable circumstances as envisioned in Section 51 (7) of the TPA, as cited below, prevent a taxpayer from fulfilling its obligations: -“(7)The Commissioner may allow an application for the extension of time to file a notice of objection if—(a)the taxpayer was prevented from lodging the notice of objection within the period specified in subsection (2) because of an absence from Kenya, sickness or other reasonable cause; and(b)the taxpayer did not unreasonably delay in lodging the notice of objection.”52.The Tribunal has perused the evidence presented before it and finds that the Appellant filed its notice of objection out of time and failed to provide a reason for filing its objection late. In addition, the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof as required under Section 30 (b) of the TAT Act when it failed to adduce evidence to support its Appeal against the impugned late objection rejection decision and to demonstrate that it did not unreasonably delay in lodging its notice of objection.53.Section 30 (b) of the TAT Act provides that: -“In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving—a.…b.in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”54.It is the Tribunal’s considered view that the Appellant has failed to discharge its evidential burden of proof under Section 107 (1) of theEvidence Actin demonstrating that the Respondent’s decision in rejecting the Appellant’s late notice of objection was in any reasonable manner improper or arbitrary.55.The Tribunal is further guided by the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No.247 of 2020] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”56.The Tribunal is therefore persuaded that the Respondent was right in rejecting the Appellant’s late objection application.Final Decision57.The upshot to the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal lacks merit and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.Each party to bear its own costs.58.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULA -CHAIRMANEUNICE N.

in failing to consider the Appellant's nature of business thereon.c.The Commissioner for Domestic Taxes erred in fact and law by failing to consider the expenses and direct costs incurred by the

Appellant’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated 31stAugust 2023 and filed on 4thSeptember 2023.22.The Appellant averred that the Respondent did not understand its industry, its working

and filed on 4thOctober 2023.b.The Written Submissions dated 18thMarch 2024 and filed on the same date.27.The Respondent raised a preliminary objection as to whether the Appeal herein is valid. The Respondent stated that it issued its decision dated 9thDecember 2022 and that consequently the Appellant was required to file a Notice of Appeal within 30 days upon receipt of the Respondent's objection decision. That the Appellant had until 9thJanuary 2023 to file an Appeal against the objection decision.28.That should the Appellant fail to lodge the Appeal within the statutory timelines, the Appellant is required to make an application to file the Appeal out of time as per the provisions of Section 13 (3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act.29.That the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal dated 31stAugust 2023 on 4thSeptember 2023 without seeking leave from the Tribunal to file it out of time and therefore the same is invalid and should be struck out.30.That Sections 24 and 28 of theTax Procedures Actallow a taxpayer to file returns and further provides that the Commissioner is not bound by the information provided therein and can assess the tax liability based on any other available information.31.That Sections 77 of theIncome Tax Actand Section 31 of theTax Procedures Act, allow the Respondent to issue additional tax assessments where a taxpayer has been assessed of a lesser amount based on any additional available information and to the best of his judgement.32.The Respondent averred that the additional Income tax assessments for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 and VAT assessments for July 2018, October 2018, November 2018 and December 2018 were based on the Appellant’s undeclared sales as per its VAT and Income Tax returns.33.The Respondent averred that at the objection stage the Appellant failed to avail the documentation in support of the objections raised.34.The Respondent further averred that the additional Income and VAT assessments were confirmed due to the Appellant’s failure to avail documentation in support of the objections raised.35.The Respondent in support of its case relied on the holdings in Oliver Merrick Fowler & Anor vs KRA [2022] eKLR. Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement vs Pearl Industries Ltd [2022] eKLR and Nguruman Traders Ltd vs Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement [2019] eKLR amongst Others.Respondent’s prayers36.The Respondent prayed to the Tribunal for the following orders: -a.That the Respondent’s decision dated 9thDecember 2022 be upheld.b.That the Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid of merit.Issues For Determination37.The Tribunal, having carefully reviewed the pleadings and filings made by the parties and the supporting documentation is of the view that the following issues fall for its determination: -a.Whether there is a valid appeal.b.Whether the Respondent’s Objection decision dated 9thDecember 2022 is justified.Analysis And Findingsa. Whether there is a valid appeal38.The Respondent raised a preliminary objection in the matter arguing that there was no valid appeal as the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal was filed out of time. There is no rebuttal from the Appellant on this issue.39.The Tribunal notes that the Appellant upon being dissatisfied with the Objection decision dated 9thDecember 2022 filed its Notice of Appeal on 4thSeptember 2023.40.The Tribunal further noted that the procedure for appeal as set out in Section 13 (1) (b) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act(TAT Act) requires that a notice of appeal shall be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner. The Section provides as follows:-“(1)A notice of appeal to the Tribunal shall-(a)be…………………(b)be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.”41.The Notice of Appeal filed on 4thSeptember 2023 was, according to Section 13 (1) (b) TAT Act, well outside the requisite time and the Tribunal further noted that the Appellant failed to apply for leave to file the Notice of appeal out of time as required in Section 13(3) of the TAT Act which provides as follows:“The Tribunal may, upon application in writing or through electronic means, extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).”42.The Tribunal is of the considered view that the timelines for appealing the Commissioner’s decisions are clearly set out in the law, and taxpayers are liable to comply with the same.43.The Tribunal reiterates its holding in the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No.247 of 2020] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”44.The Tribunal is also guided on the adherence to timelines by the case ofEastleigh Mall Limited v Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement (Income Tax Appeal E068 of 2020) [2023] KEHC 20000 (KLR) where the court held as thus: -“... Parliament in its wisdom knew that in matters tax, time is very crucial as those in commerce need to make informed decisions. If the Commissioner is allowed to exercise his discretion and stay ad-infinitum before issuing an objection decision, the tax payer would be unable to make crucial decisions and plan his/her business properly. The timelines set are mandatory and not a procedural technicality.”45.Based on the law and the case laws cited above, the Tribunal finds that there is no valid appeal before it as the Notice of Appeal in the matter was filed out of time and without the leave of the Tribunal.

      [2024] KETAT 1236 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalTribunal Appeal E521 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, G Ogaga, Jephthah Njagi & E Ng'ang'a, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenFrancis Mwangi MwauraAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentJudgmentBackground1.The Appellant is an individual based in Nakuru offering craft and related services, registered for income tax – resident, PAYE and VAT obligations.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya (KRA Act). Under Section 5 (1) of the Act, KRA is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue. For the performance of its function under Subsection (1), the Authority is mandated under Section 5(2) of the Act to administer and enforce all provisions of the written laws as set out in Parts I and II of the First Schedule to the KRA Act to assess, collect, and account for all revenues under those laws.3.The Respondent issued Value Added Tax (VAT) additional assessments amounting to Kshs. 1,864,381.59 for the periods December 2017, December 2018, December 2019 and December 2020 on 30thApril 2021 and 9thMarch 2022.4.The Appellant objected to the Respondent’s additional assessments on 11thApril 2022 and 28thApril 2022.5.In a letter dated 7thJune 2022, the Respondent informed the Appellant that it had declined to grant the application by the Appellant to lodge a late objection and informed him that the taxes assessed are due and payable.6.The Respondent subsequently issued late objection rejection notices dated 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022.7.The Appellant, being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s decisions dated 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022, filed his Notice of Appeal on 29thAugust 2023.The Appeal8.The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal dated 25thAugust 2023 and filed on 29thAugust 2023 which raised the following grounds: -a.That the Respondent erred in its decision to issue the Appellant with additional tax assessments of VAT for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.b.That the assessments had no basis and did not reflect the true state of the account for the above assessments.c.That the income for majority of the revenue generated came from the exempt supplies that were being handled at the time when the business was of going concern.Appellant’s Case9.The Appellant’s case is premised on the Appellant’s Statement of Facts filed on 29thAugust 2023 and the documents attached to it.10.The Appellant stated that the Respondent erred in assessments of VAT for the periods December 2017, December 2018, December 2019 and December 2020.Appellant’s prayers11.The Appellant prayed for the following: -a.The Commissioner to vacate the assessment based on the correct position of the account.b.The incomes from exempt supplies be considered and be reflected in the accounts.Respondent’s Case12.The Respondent’s case is premised on the following documents:-a.The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated and filed 27thOctober 2023 and the documents attached thereto;b.Its Written Submissions filed on 22ndMarch 2024.13.The Respondent averred that it raised Value Added Tax (VAT) additional assessments amounting to Kshs. 1,864,381.59 for the periods December 2017, December 2018, December 2019 and December 2020 on 30thApril 2021 and 9thMarch 2022 based on the information availed to it.14.That the Appellant objected to the Respondent’s additional assessments on 11thApril 2022 and 28thApril 2022.15.The Respondent averred that it requested the Appellant vide email correspondence dated 22ndApril 2022 to regularise his objection within 7 days by providing documentary evidence in support of his late application and objection.16.The Respondent stated that on 7thJune 2022, it invalidated the Appellant’s objection and confirmed the assessments as the Appellant failed to meet the requirements of Section 51(7) of theTax Procedures Act, having failed to provide clarifications on his reason for late objection and documentary evidence in support of the same.17.That the Appellant being dissatisfied by the Respondent’s decision, filed this Appeal before the Tribunal.18.The Respondent averred that the assessments were in strict conformity to the relevant statutes and the same reflected the true status of the Appellant’s account.19.The Respondent further averred that failed to prove that indeed the revenue generated was of exempt supplies and as such the Respondent proceeded to assess the Appellant on the information available.20.The Respondent placed reliance on theTax Procedures Actwhich under Section 56 places the onus in tax objections on the taxpayer to avail evidence that would support a contrary assessment or that would have guided the Respondent in arriving at a different objection decision.21.The Respondent relied on the case of Metcash Trading Limited vs Commissioner for the South Africa Revenue Services and another Case CCT 3/2000, where Justice Kriegler opined that: -“But the burden of proving that the Commissioner was wrong rests on the vendor. Because VAT is inherently a system of self-assessment based on vendor's own record, it is obvious that the incidence of this onus can have a decisive effect on the outcome of an objection decision.”22.The Respondent averred that it considered all documents availed to it by the Appellant and that the same did not support the Appellant’s claim.Respondent’s prayers23.The Respondent prayed that this Tribunal finds that: -a.The Respondent’s objection decision dated 7thJune 2023 is proper in law and the same be affirmed.b.The additional assessment of Kshs. 1,864,381.59, resultant penalty and interest are due and payable by the Appellant.Issue For Determination24.The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the parties, and considers the single issue falling for its determination as being:-SUBDIVISION - Whether there is a valid Appeal on record.Analysis And Findings25.The Tribunal analysed the issue that calls for its determination having reviewed all the pleadings, information and documents adduced by the Appellant and the Respondent concerning the impugned decisions.26.The Respondent issued Value Added Tax (VAT) additional assessments amounting to Kshs. 1,864,381.59 for the periods December 2017, December 2018, December 2019 and December 2020 on 30thApril 2021 and 9thMarch 2022.27.The Appellant objected to the Respondent’s additional assessments on 11thApril 2022 and 28thApril 2022.28.In a letter dated 7thJune 2022, the Respondent informed the Appellant that it had declined to grant the application by the Appellant to lodge a late objection, and informed him that the taxes assessed are due and payable.29.The Respondent subsequently issued late objection rejection notices dated 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022.30.The Appellant, being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s decisions dated 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022, filed his Notice of Appeal on 29thAugust 2023.31.The Tribunal notes that the procedure for appeal provided in Section 13(1)(b) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) Act requires that a Notice of Appeal be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty (30) days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.32.Section 13(3) of the TAT Act provides the remedy to any party who wishes to lodge an Appeal out of time, being that any such intended Appellant may seek leave of the Tribunal in writing, seeking an extension of time and leave to file an Appeal out of time. The provision reads: -“The Tribunal may, upon application in writing or through electronic means, extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).”33.The Tribunal’s position is that the Appellant ought to have lodged his Notice of Appeal within thirty (30) days from 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022, being the dates he received the Respondent’s decisions. The Tribunal observes from the documents on record that the Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on 29thAugust 2023, which was on a date later than thirty (30) days of receiving the Respondent’s decisions of 24thJune 2022 and 1stSeptember 2022.34.The Tribunal is of the considered view that the timelines for appealing the Commissioner’s decisions are clearly set in the law, and all parties are liable to comply with the timelines, save for when unavoidable circumstances prevent a party from fulfilling its obligations as envisioned in Section 13(4) of the TAT Act which states: -“(4)An extension under subsection (3) may be granted owing to absence from Kenya, or sickness, or other reasonable cause that may have prevented the applicant from filing the notice of appeal or submitting the documents within the specified period.”35.The Tribunal further notes that the Appellant failed to apply for leave to file his Notice of Appeal out of time as required under the aforecited Section 13(3) of the TAT Act.36.The Tribunal refers to the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No. 247 of 2020] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”37.The Tribunal is further guided by TAT Appeal No. 1321 of 2022 CKL Africa Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes where it was held: -“63.The law makes provisions under Section 13 (3) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actfor any party who lodges its appeal out of time and with reasonable grounds, to seek leave of the Tribunal to file its appeal out if time, the Appellant did not move the Tribunal seeking such Orders.64.The timelines provided under Section 47 (13) of theTax Procedures Actand Section 13 (1) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actdemand strict adherence and are not discretional to any party lodging an appeal before the Tribunal.65.It is the Tribunal’s position that there is no proper and valid Appeal before the Tribunal for the exercise of its jurisdiction.”38.The Tribunal finds that the Notice of Appeal herein was lodged beyond the statutorily prescribed period and is therefore incompetent and untenable in law. The Appeal is therefore not validly and properly before the Tribunal.Final Decision39.The upshot of the above analysis is that the Tribunal finds that the Appeal is incompetent and accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:a.The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.b.Each party to bear its own costs.40.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANGLORIA A.

The Respondent is also mandated with the responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the statutes set out in the Schedule of the Act.3.The Appellant vide a letter dated 20thJanuary, 2023 sought a private ruling from the Respondent regarding whether it could include the share of profit from Watu Credit and Cummins C & G Joint Venture in determining it’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).4.The Respondent through a private ruling dated 1stMarch, 2023 informed the Appellant that it could not include the share of profits from Watu Credit and Cummings C & G Joint Venture in its EBITDA.5.The Respondent thereafter vide a letter dated 17thMay, 2023 issued a pre-assessment notice informing the Appellant of its intention to amend its Corporation tax return for the year of income ended September 2022 to restrict the deductible interest expense.6.The Respondent issued its Assessment order to the Appellant on 6thJune, 2023 for Corporation tax amounting to Kshs 60,885,063.53 inclusive of interest of Kshs 7,017,248.94.7.The Appellant objected to the assessment through a letter dated 6thJuly, 2023. The Respondent subsequently issued its objection decision through a letter dated 23rdAugust, 2023 confirming total tax amounting to Kshs 49,566,383.28 inclusive of interest and penalties.8.The Appellant aggrieved by the Respondent‘s objection decision, lodged its Notice of Appeal dated 22ndSeptember, 2023 at the Tribunal.THE APPEAL9.The Appellant as per its Memorandum of Appeal dated 6thOctober, 2023 and filed on 12thOctober, 2023 raised the following grounds of appeal:a.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law by failing to find that the principles of fair administrative action require that the assessment, which is a document recognized by theTax Procedures Act2015 (theTax Procedures Act), must contain sufficient reasons to enable the Appellant sufficiently object to the assessment.b.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law by failing to find that the assessment as issued did not meet the standard required by the relevant law and thus impeded the ability of the Appellant to mount a proper defense.c.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law in determining that the Appellant should have excluded the share of profits from (a) the Appellant's associate company and (b) the Appellant's joint venture in calculating the Appellant's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the period between 1stOctober 2021 and 30thSeptember 2022.d.That the Respondent erred in fact and in law by ignoring the ambiguity created on the question of whether share of profit from associates and joint ventures should be excluded in computation of EBITDA due to the lack of definition of EBITDA under theIncome Tax Actand the fact that due to the ambiguity, the provisions should be interpreted in the Appellant's favor.Appellant's Case10.The Appellant supported its case with its Statement of Facts dated 6thOctober, 2023 and filed on 12thOctober, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto and Written Submissions dated and filed on 11thApril, 2024.11.The Appellant stated that it holds a 29% shareholding in an associate company resident in Kenya, Watu Credit Limited (Watu Credit), and also has a 50% shareholding in a joint venture, Cummins C&G Holdings Limited (Cummins C&G Joint Venture).12.That as per the Appellant's audited financial statements for the year of income ended 30thSeptember 2022, the Appellant earned share of profits from Watu Credit and Cummins C&G Joint Venture, which amounts were included in the Appellant's income statement for the period.13.That on 20thJanuary 2023, the Appellant sought a private ruling from the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes of the Kenya Revenue Authority (the Commissioner) as to whether the Appellant could include the share of profits from Watu Credit and the share of profits from Cummins C&G Joint Venture in determining the Appellant's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the purpose of computing its deductible interest expense pursuant to Section 16 (2) (j) of theIncome Tax Act.14.That the Commissioner, through a private ruling dated 1stMarch 2023 (the Private Ruling) ruled that the Appellant could not include the share of profits from Watu Credit and Cummings C&G Joint Venture in its EBITDA amount for purposes of determining the deductible interest expense.15.That thereafter, sometime in April 2023, the Commissioner sought to audit the Appellant on the interest expense amount claimed in its tax return for the year of income ended September 2022.16.That subsequently, the Commissioner issued an assessment for additional tax of Kshs.60,685,063.00 comprised of principal tax and interest of Ksh 53,666,814.00 and Ksh 7,018,248.00 respectively, vide an iTax assessment order dated 6thJune 2023.17.That aggrieved by the Assessment Order, the Appellant objected to the entire assessment vide a notice of objection dated 5thJuly 2023.18.That as per the notice of objection, the Appellant's grounds of objection were that:a.The Assessment Order was generic and lacked the requisite details and reasons on the basis of the additional assessment.b.The Assessment Order was invalid as it impeded the ability of the Appellant to lodge a valid objection notice in accordance with the requirements of theTax Procedures Actdue to the lack of details on the adjustment made resulting in the incremental income tax liability.c.Based on the lack of definition of EBITDA under theIncome Tax Actand the provisions of the relevant accounting standards, profit share from the associated and joint venture should form part of EBITDA.d.The profit share from Watu Credit and Cummins C&G Joint Venture does not constitute exempt income since the income was subjected to tax in the hands of the respective entities and should therefore not be excluded in the calculation of EBITDA for the purposes of determining the deductible interest expense.e.Subsequent amendments by the Finance Act 2023 to restrict the applicability of EBITDA rule on restriction of interest only to taxable interest on loans from non-resident persons further emphasizes the lack of clarity of Section16 (2)(j).19.That on 23rdAugust 2023, the Respondent issued its Objection decision confirming the assessment of Ksh 49,566,383.00 comprised of principal tax, penalty and interest of Ksh 43,864,065.00, Ksh 2,193,202.80 and Ksh 3,509,124.48, respectively.20.The Appellant anchored its case under the following sub-headings;i.The Respondent did not discharge its burden to provide sufficient details in assessing the Appellant by purporting to provide details in a pre - assessment notice.21.The Appellant submitted that the Assessment Order as issued was generic and lacked the requisite details and reasons on the basis of the additional assessment.22.The Appellant noted that the Respondent having realized the mistake, now claims that the sufficient basis and clarity for the Assessment Order was provided in the Pre-assessment notice. The Appellant submitted that the Respondent could not be deemed to have discharged its duty to provide sufficient details in the Assessment Order by making reference to the Pre-assessment notice which is a separate document from the Assessment Order.23.The Appellant averred that Section 51 (1) of theTax Procedures Actprovides that:“a taxpayer who wishes to dispute a tax decision shall first lodge an objection against the tax decision under this section.”24.That theTax Procedures Actdefines a tax decision to include an assessment (but not a pre-assessment notice). That further, assessment is defined to mean a self-assessment, default assessment, advance assessment, or amended assessment, and includes any other assessment made under a tax law. That this definition does not include a pre-assessment order and no other Section of theTax Procedures Actprovides for the same.25.That in addition, as the Respondent rightfully pointed out, the Assessment Order was issued pursuant to Section 31 of theTax Procedures Act, which Section provides for amended assessments.26.That therefore, the Respondent cannot be deemed to have discharged its duty to give sufficient reasons by making reference to the Pre-Assessment Order, a document which is not recognized under theTax Procedures Act. That the Respondent ought to have included all the requisite details and reasons on the basis of the additional assessment in the Assessment Order.27.The Appellant stated that inRepublic v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes ex parte Barclays Bank of Kenya Limited, (Misc. Application no. 1223 of 2007), the Honourable Justice Majanja held that:“...in assessing taxes, the Respondent was under duty to identify the transactions or payments that attract tax, especially where there are objections to such categorization. Section 35(1)(a) of theIncome Tax Actidentifies specific types of payments that attract tax, the respondent is obligated by law to state with clarity its claim and state how the transaction falls within the terms of the statute. The respondent cannot exercise its duty like a trawler in the deep seas expecting all the fish by casting its net wide. The respondent's decision in this respect falls below this standard and the transaction caught by the decision cannot be said to fall within the statutory definition of the tax.""28.The Appellant submitted that in line with the decision of the High Court, the Assessment Order as raised did not offer sufficient clarity in terms of the amounts assessed or how the assessment fell under the purview of theIncome Tax Act.29.That in addition, Article 47 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya 2010 provides that if a fundamental freedom of a person is likely to be adversely affected by administrative action, then the person has the right to be given written reasons for such an administrative action.30.That further, Section 4 (2) of theFair Administrative Action ActNo. 4 of 2015 (FAA) provides that every person has a right to be given written reasons for any administrative action that is taken against them.31.It contended that Section 2 of the FAA defines an administrative action to include ""any act, omission or decision of any person, body or authority that affects the legal rights or interests of any person to whom such action relates.""32.The Appellant submitted that an Assessment Order is an administrative action since it is issued by an authority, being the KRA, and it affects the legal rights of the Appellant whom it is issued.33.That in addition, the Tax Appeals Tribunal in the case of Local Productions Kenya Limited vs. Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Appeal No.50 of 2017, in upholding application of the fair administrative action principles in tax matters held that:-“..therefore, the respondent cannot just cast aside this constitutional test for administrative action at the expense of collecting revenue. Article 47 ofthe Constitutionis intended to subject administrative processes to constitutional discipline hence relief of common law or judicial review under theLaw Reform Act(Cap 26 of the Laws of Kenya) but is to be measured against the standards established bythe Constitution.""34.That further in Geothermal Development Company Limited v Attorney General & 3 others, the High Court in upholding that the KRA had not issued the Petitioner with a proper assessment notice, thereby violating its right to fair administrative action held that:“as a component of due process, it is important that a party has reasonable opportunity to know the basis of allegations against it. Elementary justice and the law demand that a person be given full information on the case against him and given reasonable opportunity to present a response. This right is not limited only in cases of a hearing as in the case of a court or before a tribunal, but when taking administrative actions as well.""35.The Appellant submitted that in line with the provisions of Article 47 and Article 50 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya on fair administrative action and the right to a fair hearing, respectively, in issuing the Assessment Order, the Commissioner was required to make reference to the specific law which was being relied upon in issuing the Assessment Order and clearly outline the basis and computation of the amount assessed.36.The Appellant submitted that the Assessment Order as issued does not meet the requirement of Section 4(2) of the FAA. To emphasize this, the Appellant noted that the Assessment Oder only stated that it was an additional income tax assessment and proceeded to annex changes which had been made to the Appellant's income tax assessment. That as per the Assessment Order, the changes leading to the tax liability were neither highlighted nor designated. That consequently, the Appellant was unable to identify the relevant adjustments that had been made leading to the additional tax assessment. That further, the Assessment Order provided no reasons for the adjustments.ii.The Assessment Order is invalid as it impedes the ability of the Appellant to lodge a valid objection notice in accordance with the requirements of theTax Procedures Act37.The Appellant asserted that the Respondent cannot allege to have provided details and the basis of the additional tax assessed under the Assessment Order vide the Pre-Assessment Order as these are two distinct documents and the latter had no legal basis under theTax Procedures Act.38.That Section 51 (3) (a) of theTax Procedures Actprovides that a notice of objection shall only be treated as validly lodged if it states precisely (a) the grounds of objection (b) the amendments required to be made to correct the decision and (c) the reason for the amendments.39.The Appellant submitted that the Assessment Order as issued impeded its ability to object to the Assessment Order since from a review of the Assessment Order, it was impossible for the Appellant to determine the relevant adjustments that have been made resulting in the incremental income tax liability. That consequently, the Appellant was unable to precisely identify the amendments that would be required to be made to correct the assessment.40.The Appellant therefore submitted that the Assessment Order as issued violated its rights to fair hearing as set out in Article 50 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya. That Article 50 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya guarantees every person a right to a fair hearing which includes the right to be informed of the dispute as well as the nature of the same, and have adequate opportunity to object and file a defense. The Appellant submitted that its right to be heard and adequately prepare a defense was impeded by the incomprehensible Assessment Order which denied it the ability to file a proper objection.iii.Based on the lack of definition of EBITDA under theIncome Tax Actand the provisions of the relevant accounting standards, share of profits from the Appellant's associate company and the Appellant's joint venture should form part of EBITDA41.The Appellant stated that it noted that the Respondent relied on the OECD Guidelines and comments on its publication ""Limiting Base Erosion involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments Action 4-2016"" in holding that the share of profit from the Appellant's associate company and the Appellant's joint venture should be excluded in computation of EBITDA. The Appellant submitted that while OECD Guidelines and Commentaries offer supplementary guidance, they are not legally binding in Kenya.42.The Appellant submitted that Section 16 (2) (j) of theIncome Tax Actprovides that in determining the amount of interest that is deductible in the computation of taxable income, the amount of interest deductible shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of EBITDA in any financial year provided that any income which is exempt from tax shall be excluded from the calculation of EBITDA.43.The Appellant further noted that theIncome Tax Actlacks an operative definition of the term ""EBITDA"". That to this end, it was the Appellant's considered view that in the absence of the definition of the term EBITDA in theIncome Tax Act, reliance can be placed on the ordinary accounting practice, and dictionary definitions of the term.44.That in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 28 and 31, the equity method of accounting is prescribed for associates and joint ventures. That under this method, an entity's initial investment in an associate or joint venture is recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the entity's share of profit or loss from the associate or joint venture. That this share of profit or loss is then recognized in the profit and loss statement.45.The Appellant submitted that IAS 31 provides two methods of accounting for investments in joint ventures: proportionate consolidation and the equity method (similar to that under IAS 28). That proportionate consolidation allows for the combination of an entity's share of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses with similar items, line by line, in its financial statements, or the inclusion of separate line items for the share of these items from the joint venture.46.That on the other hand, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) IASB agenda, ref 21B on the project ""Primary Financial Statements""- on the topic ""Presentation of the share of the profit or loss of 'integral' associates and joint ventures"" January 2018, discussed the need to differentiate between ""integral"" and 2 associates and joint ventures. That an ""integral"" associate or joint venture, as per paragraph32, was defined as being integrated into an entity's business activities and essential and fundamental to carrying out those activities.47.It submitted that its associate, Watu Credit Ltd, was involved in lending and offers credit to the company's customers, while its joint venture, Cummins C&G Joint Venture, supplies goods to the company. That these entities are integrated into the Appellant's operations and are critical to its operation and generation of business income.48.The Appellant maintained that the recommendation from the IFRS paper suggests that the profit share of integral associates and joint ventures should be reported as a separate line item in the profit and loss statement before ""Profit before Tax"" or ""Earnings Before Tax"" (EBT). That this reporting presentation had been adopted by the Appellant.49.That moreover, from an accounting perspective, the term ""EBITDA"" comprises various components, including Earnings Before Tax (EBT), Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT), and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA).50.The Appellant further submitted that EBT represents money retained internally by a company before subtracting tax expenses, and it is an accounting measure of a company's operating and non-operating profits which is at times referred to as ""income before tax"" or ""pre-tax income"". That it was used in accounting for comparing performance of similar entities located in different tax rates jurisdiction/area. That while EBT adds back taxes to net income, EBIT and EBITDA add back additional layers of expenses. That EBIT adds back interest and taxes, while EBITDA goes further by adding depreciation and amortization expenses. The Appellant therefore submitted that these add-backs do not necessarily reflect an entity's ability to generate earnings from its operations.51.That in addition, the Appellant holds that it is trite law that tax statutes should be interpreted strictly, with no room for implication or intendment. That further, if there is any ambiguity in tax law, the same ought to be interpreted in the taxpayer's favour. That this position was affirmed in the case of Keroche Industries Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority & 5 Others [2007] 2 KLR 240 where it was held that:“taxation can only be done on clear words and cannot be on intendment and that where there are two or more possible meanings, the inclination of the court should be against the construction or interpretation which imposes a burden, tax or duty on the subject"".52.That considering the aforementioned definitions and considering that EBT, which is included in EBITDA, comprises both operating and non-operating profits, the Appellant asserts that its profit share from Watu Credit and Cummings C&G Joint Venture should form part of EBITDA for the purpose of calculating allowable interest expense.iv.Share of profits from associates and income from joint ventures does not constitute exempt income and should therefore not be excluded in the calculation of EBITDA for the purposes of restricting the deductibility of interest.53.The Appellant stated that Section 16 (2) (j) of theIncome Tax Actprovides that in determining the amount of interest that is deductible in the computation of taxable income, the amount of interest deductible shall not exceed thirty percent(30%) of EBITDA in any financial year provided that any income which is exempt from tax shall be excluded from the calculation of EBITDA.54.The Appellant submitted that theIncome Tax Actdoes not contain a definition of the term exempt income. On that basis, the Appellant submitted that the phrase ""income which is exempt from tax"" would imply that the income which is to be excluded from the EBITDA calculation is income which has not been subjected to income tax.55.In this case, the Appellant averred that applying the interpretation above, it was entitled to take into account the profit share from Watu Credit and Cummins C&G Joint Venture in the determining its EBITDA since such profits were subjected to tax in the hands of Watu Credit and Cummins C&G Joint Venture, respectively, and therefore could not constitute income which is exempt from tax.56.That the Respondent holds that the profits from the Appellant's associates and income from the joint venture were not considered taxable income while computing the Appellant's tax and as a result should be excluded in computing EBITDA per Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act. The Appellant noted that the Section merely refers to ""income which is exempt from tax"" and does not specify under which entity the income is not taxable.57.To this end, the Appellant submitted that Kenyan courts have repeatedly held that where there is ambiguity in a taxing provision, such ambiguity should be interpreted in favour of the taxpayer. That in Republic vs.Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Large Tax Payer's Office Ex-Parte Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd(2012) eKLR the Judge held that:“I am also guided by the dictum of Lord Simonds in Russell v Scott [1948] 2 ALL ER 5 where he stated, ""My Lords, there is a maxim of income tax law which, though it may sometimes be overstressed yet ought not to be forgotten. It is that the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him"" adopted in Stanbic Bank Kenya Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority CA Civil Appeal No. 77 of 2008 (Unreported) [2009] eKLR per Nyamu JA (See also Jafferali Alibhai v Commissioner of Income Tax [1961] EA 610, Kanjee Naranjee v Income Tax Commissioner [1964] EA 257). Any tax imposed on a subject is dictated by the terms of legislation and taxing authority must satisfy itself that the transaction fits within the definition of the statute.""58.The Appellant therefore submitted that considering the various interpretations that the phrase “income which is exempt from tax"" can have and the fact that there is no definition of the said phrase in theIncome Tax Act, the phrase is ambiguous. That on this basis, the phrase ""income which is exempt from tax"" must be interpreted in favour of the understanding held by the Appellant which entitles the Appellant to take into account the profit share from Watu Credit and Cummins C & G Joint Venture in calculating its EBITDA.v.Subsequent amendment by the Finance Act 2023 further emphasizes the lack of clarity of Section 16(2)(1)59.The Appellant noted that effective 1stJanuary 2024 the Finance Act 2023 amended Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Actso that any interest in excess of thirty per cent of EBITDA be an allowable deduction in ascertaining the total income of a person in the subsequent three years of income to the extent that the deduction of interest on loans from non-resident persons does not exceed the thirty percent of EBITDA. That effectively, the EBITDA rule on restriction of interest would only apply in relation to taxable interest on loans from non-resident persons. That the Finance Act 2023 further provides that the amended provision shall not apply to interest income exempt from tax under theIncome Tax Act.60.The Appellant asserted that the amendment of Section 16(2)(j) and particularly the clarification that the new provision shall not apply where the interest is exempt from tax under this Act shows is reflective of the fact that the current Section 16(2)(j) was ambiguous and hence the attempt to further clarify any new amendments relating to the Section.61.The Appellant noted that reference to the amendments to Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Actwas only meant to point out the inherent ambiguity in the provisions and not to rely on the amendments retrospectively as implied by the Respondent.62.The Appellant asserted that it should not be penalized where a taxing provision is in itself ambiguous and subject to amendments intended to clarify its application.Appellant’s Prayer63.The Appellant’s prayer to the Tribunal was for the following orders:a.Sets aside the assessment and demand of Ksh 49,566,383.28 per the Objection decision.b.Awards costs of the Appeal to the Appellant.Respondents Case64.In its response to the Appellant’s case, the Respondent grounded its response on its Statement of Facts dated 1stNovember 2023 and filed on 8thNovember, 2023 and Written submissions dated and filed on 9thApril 2024.65.The Respondent submitted that the Appellant holds 29% shareholding in an associate company resident in Kenya, Watu Credit Limited (Watu Credit) and has a 50% shareholding in a joint venture, Cummins C & G Holdings (Cummins C&G Joint Venture).66.That prior to the Appellant filing its Income tax returns, the Appellant sought for the sector's advice on whether or not to include the share of profits from its associates and income from the joint venture into the computation of its Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for purposes of ascertaining allowable interest expenses.67.That the Appellant received the sector's advice via email where it was advised not to include the said profits in its computation for EBITDA.68.That the Appellant further sought for a private ruling from the Respondent on the above issue for purposes of Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act.69.The Respondent stated that through a private ruling dated 1stMarch 2023, guided the Appellant not to include the said share of profits and income from the joint venture when computing its EBITDA as the same income had been treated by the Appellant as non-taxable income.70.That upon review of the Appellant's 2021-2022 Income tax returns, the Respondent noted that the Appellant did not adhere to both the Sector's advise and the Respondent's private ruling but instead share of profits from its associates and income from joint venture were included in computation of EBITDA for purposes of restriction of interest expense claimable.71.The Respondent stated that on 6thJune 2023 issued the Appellant with an assessment notice based on the review of the specific issue of restriction of interest expense in line with the provisions of Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act.72.That the Appellant was dissatisfied with the said additional assessment, and on 5thJuly 2023 lodged an objection against the said assessment.73.That the Respondent considered the Appellant's grounds of objection & accompanying documentation, and fully rejected the Appellant's objection subsequently confirming the assessments on 23rdAugust 2023 in the sum of Kshs.49,566,383.28 inclusive of penalties and interest.74.The Respondent stated that it exercised its best judgment in making the assessment in full consideration of the documentation and information available pursuant to Section 31 of theTax Procedures Act.75.That the Appellant alleged that the assessment infringed on its right to fair administrative action. The Respondent contended that the assessment was based on the computation of disallowed interest expense as clearly set out in the private ruling and the pre-assessment notice issued to the Appellant in line with Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Acttherefore the assessment was justified.76.That Section 16 (2) (j) of theIncome Tax Actstates;“(1)Save as otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of ascertaining the total income of a person for a year of income, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of-(2)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of-(1)gross interest paid or payable to related persons and third parties in excess of thirty per cent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the borrower in any financial year; Provided that-(i)any income which is exempt from tax shall be excluded from the calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and(ii)this paragraph shall apply to-(a)Interest on all loans;(b)Payments that are economically equivalent to interest; and(c)Expenses incurred in connection with raising the finance""77.The Respondent stated that it reviewed the Appellant's IT2C returns for the financial year ending September 2022 and the same established that the Appellant had claimed interest expense amounting to Kshs. 323,455,290.00 which translates to computed EBITDA of Kshs. 1,078,184,300/- as shown in the table below;TABLETRTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 48%}DescriptionTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 51%}Amount (Kshs.)TRTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 48%}Interest Expense-P& LTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 51%}428,507,000TRTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 48%}Interest Disallowed-TaxTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 51%}105,051,710TRTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 48%}Interest ClaimedTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 51%}323,455,290TRTC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 48%}EBITDATC{style border: 1px solid #000; width: 51%}1,078,184,30078.That upon review of the Appellant's tax computation of the aforesaid EBITDA, the Respondent established that the Appellant included share of profit from associates of Kshs. 623,274,000.00 and share of profit from the joint venture of Kshs.17,497,000.00.79.That the Respondent communicated to the Appellant through the private ruling that according to Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Actinterest and in line with the OECD's publication. That non-taxable income such as branch profits or dividend income that benefit from participation, exemption should not be included in the calculations of EBITDA.80.The Respondent averred that the Appellant had all along been aware of the basis of the assessment as evidenced by the detailed objection whose grounds include the source of the amount assessed and the historical genesis of the assessment.81.The Respondent averred that the profits share from associates and joint ventures are not considered taxable income when computing the tax payable and therefore the same should be omitted when computing the EBITDA.82.The Respondent contended that there is no ambiguity in the law. That the Respondent in its private ruling clearly guided the Appellant based on Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act, the Appellant was required to make appropriate adjustments for taxable branch profits and dividend incomes to the extent that it is shielded from tax by foreign tax credits in order to address Base Erosion & Profit Shifting issues.83.That the Appellant in its computation for income tax payable for the year ending 31stOctober 2021 considered the share of profit from its associate and joint venture partners excluded the same as non- taxable income.84.The Respondent contended that the amendment of the Finance Act 2023 is not material to the present Appeal as the law should be applied prospectively unless expressly provided, which is not the case herein.85.The Respondent stated that this Appeal is unmeritorious because the assessment and the subsequent objection decision is proper and duly anchored in law, and there was therefore no basis to set aside the assessment.Respondent's Prayer86.The Respondent's prayer to the Tribunal was for orders that:a.Upholds the Respondent's decision as proper and in conformity with the provisions of the law.b.That this Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid any merit.Issues for Determination87.The Tribunal having considered the pleadings and submissions made by the parties is of the considered view that the Appeal distils into a single issue for determination namely:Whether the Respondent’s Income tax additional assessment was justified.Analysis and Determination88.Before delving into the substantive issue in this case, the Tribunal notes that the Appellant challenged the legality of the Respondent’s Assessment Order. It stated that that the Assessment Order as issued was generic and lacked the requisite details and reasons on the basis of the additional assessment.89.The Appellant noted that the Respondent having realized the mistake, now claims that the sufficient basis and clarity for the Assessment Order was provided in the Pre-Assessment notice.90.The Tribunal notes that prior to the issuance of the assessment order to the Appellant, the Respondent had vide a letter dated 17thMay 2023 issued a letter titled ‘Pre-assessment Noticeon Review of 2022year of Income Return.’ In the letter the Respondent stated in part as follow;“…We have reviewed your corporation tax returns for the year of income ended 30thSeptember, 2022 and noted that you have deducted, against your taxable income, interest expense in excess of 30% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) contrary to the provisions of Section 16(2)(j).The purpose of this letter is therefore to notify you of our intention to amend your corporation tax return for the year of income ended 30thSeptember, 2022 to restrict the deductible interest expense to 30% of EBITDA as computed below;…”91.From the contents of the above-mentioned letter which the Appellant does not deny receiving, it was clear that the Respondent had notified the Appellant of the intention to amend the Appellant’s Corporation tax return and it further had mentioned the basis of the intended assessment.92.It was the view of the Tribunal that the Respondent had, prior to issuing the assessment informed the Appellant of the basis. Further, the Tribunal notes that given that the Respondent had already issued the tariff ruling which the Appellant has not challenged, it follows that the Appellant ought to have been aware of the Respondent’s basis for the assessment.93.The Tribunal will therefore proceed to deal with the substantive issue of the tax that is in dispute.94.It was the Appellant’s case that Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Actprovides that in determining the amount of interest that is deductible in the computation of taxable income, the amount of interest deductible shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of EBITDA in any financial year provided that any income which is exempt from tax shall be excluded from the calculation of EBITDA.95.The Appellant further stated that theIncome Tax Actlacks an operative definition of the term ""EBITDA"". That to this end, it was the Appellant's considered view that in the absence of the definition of the term EBITDA in theIncome Tax Act, reliance can be placed on the ordinary accounting practice, and dictionary definitions of the term.96.That in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 28 and 31, the equity method of accounting is prescribed for associates and joint ventures. That under this method, an entity's initial investment in an associate or joint venture is recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the entity's share of profit or loss from the associate or joint venture. That this share of profit or loss is then recognized in the profit and loss statement.97.The Respondent on its part contended that the profits share from associates and joint ventures are not considered taxable income when computing the tax payable and therefore the same should be omitted when computing the EBITDA.98.It was the Respondent’s case that there was no ambiguity in the law. That the Respondent in its private ruling clearly guided the Appellant based on Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act, the Appellant was required to make appropriate adjustments for taxable branch profits and dividend incomes to the extent that it is shielded from tax by foreign tax credits in order to address Base Erosion & Profit Shifting issues.99.Section 3 of theIncome Tax Actprovides as follows as regards charge to income tax:“(1)Subject to, and in accordance with, this Act, a tax to be known as income tax shall be charged for each year of income upon all the income of a person, whether resident or non-resident, which accrued in or was derived from Kenya.(2)Subject to this Act, income upon which tax is chargeable under this Act is income in respect of–(a)gains or profits from–(i)any business, for whatever period of time carried on…(3)For the purposes of this section–(a)""person"" does not include a partnership;”100.Further, Section 4 of theIncome Tax Act, discuses taxation of business income. It provides the following regarding income from partnerships:“For the purposes of section 3(2)(a)(i)–(a)where a business is carried on or exercised partly within and partly outside Kenya by a resident person, the whole of the gains or profits from such business shall be deemed to have accrued in or to have been derived from Kenya;(b)the gains or profits of a partner from a partnership shall be the sum of–(i)any remuneration payable to him by the partnership together with any interest on capital so payable, less any interest on capital payable by him to the partnership; and(ii)his share of the total income of the partnership, calculated after deducting the total of any remuneration and interest on capital payable to any partner by the partnership and after adding any interest on capital payable by any partner to the partnership,and where the partnership makes a loss, calculated in the manner set out in subparagraph (ii), his gains or profits shall be the excess, if any, of the amount set out in subparagraph (i) over his share of that loss…”101.The Tribunal notes that the parties had argued on the issue of justification of the Respondent’s income tax additional assessment after the Respondent disallowed interest expense based on the Section 16(2)(j) of theIncome Tax Act.102.Section 16(2)(j) restricts the amount of deductible interest expense in ascertainment of taxable income. The Section provides that:“16(1)Save as otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of ascertaining the total income of a person for a year of income, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of –(a)expenditure or loss which is not wholly and exclusively incurred by him in the production of the income;(b)capital expenditure, or any loss, diminution or exhaustion of capital.(2)(j) gross interest paid or payable to related persons and third parties in excess of thirty per cent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the borrower in any financial year: Provided that—(i)any income which is exempt from tax shall be excluded from the calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and(ii)this paragraph shall apply to—(A)interest on all loans;(B)payments that are economically equivalent to interest; and(C)expenses incurred in connection with raising the finance.”103.The Tribunal notes that although the parties did not attach a copy of the private ruling by the Respondent, it was not in dispute that prior to the assessment, the Appellant had sought and received a private ruling regarding whether to include the share of profits from its associates and income from joint venture into the computation of EBITDA. To which the Respondent had advised that the same was not allowable.104.According to Section 4 of theIncome Tax Act, business income is taxed on a person and a person does not include a partnership, which gains or profits from business are determined according to Section 4(b) of theIncome Tax Act.105.The Appellant included in its computation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amounts which it described as:a.Profit-share from associate; andb.Profit-share from joint venture.106.It is the Tribunal’s position that the KenyanIncome Tax Actdoes not envision group tax accounting or consolidated tax accounting as argued by the Appellant. The Appellant is a resident person in Kenya by virtue of its being a company incorporated under theCompanies Act.107.The Appellant stated in its pleadings that the so-called profit-share from associate is profits from Watu Credit Limited, a company which the Appellant has a shareholding of 29%, and that the so-called profit-share from joint venture is profits from Cummins C&G Holdings Limited, a company which the Appellant has a shareholding of 50%.108.Going by the reading of theIncome Tax Act, the Tribunal observes that both Watu Credit Limited and Cummins C&G Holdings Limited are persons, and that the Appellant’s relationship with the two companies is not one of partnership with other persons, but that of shareholding. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that the Appellant erred in including in its EBITDA computation in its so-called share of profits from the two entities as though it were income from a partnership.109.The Tribunal further concludes that purporting to include share of profits of other companies in the computation of the Appellant’s EBITDA was equivalent to the Appellant alluding that it accounts for the income tax of the two entities, which in this case, the Appellant has not demonstrated it does, neither has it demonstrated that it is within the law to do so.110.The Tribunal notes that the terminology employed by the Appellant to describe its inclusions of profits from associate and joint-venture in its computation of EBITDA is not founded under the KenyanIncome Tax Act. TheIncome Tax Act, under Sections 15 and 16 clearly provide for the deductions allowed or not allowed in the ascertainment of the total income of a person for a year of income.111.A person, according to theIncome Tax Act, does not include a partnership or in any case, a group of companies as alluded to by the Appellant. The Tribunal finds that it would, therefore, be improper to imply or read into the provisions of Sections 2, 3, 4, 15 and 16 of theIncome Tax Actany other meaning of the term person. As to do so violates the clear words of the statute. It also violates the principles of interpretation of tax statutes.112.The Tribunal reiterates the holding in Cape Brandy Syndicate V Inland Revenue Commissioners (1920) 1KB as applied in TM Bell V Commissioner of Income Tax (1960) EALR 224 where Roland J stated:“…. In a taxing Act, one has to look at what is clearly said. There is no room for intendment as to a tax, nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One has look into the language used… If a person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, …”113.Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s Income tax additional assessment was justified.Final Decision114.Given the foregoing analysis the Tribunal finds that the Appeal lacks merit and accordingly makes the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 23rdAugust 2023 be and is hereby upheld.c.Each Party is to bear its own costs.115.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RDDAY OF AUGUST, 2024ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANCYNTHIA B.

      [2024] KETAT 1234 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalCivilTribunal Appeal E458 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair, Jephthah Njagi & E Ng'ang'a, MembersAugust 9, 2024BetweenEquipped Trading (K) LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant is a limited liability company carrying out businesses within the Republic of Kenya.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya (KRA Act). Under Section 5 (1) of the Act, KRA is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue. For the performance of its function under Subsection (1), the Authority is mandated under Section 5(2) of the Act to administer and enforce all provisions of the written laws as set out in Parts I and II of the First Schedule to the KRA Act to assess, collect, and account for all revenues under those laws.3.The Respondent issued a notice of intention to verify tax declarations to the Appellant on 16thDecember 2021.4.VAT and Corporate income tax assessments orders were raised on iTax on 9thMay 2023 and 24thMay 2023 and the Appellant objected to the same on 3rdJune 2023.5.The Respondent issued the Appellant with objection invalidation notices dated 16thJune 2023 and the Appellant being aggrieved by the decision appealed against the same through its Notice of Appeal filed on 14thJuly 2023.The Appeal6.The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal dated 27thJuly 2023 and filed on 11thAugust 2023 raising the following grounds: -a.That the Commissioner failed in fact and in law in failing to provide precise reasons for the refusal of the Appellant's objection and proceeded to demand for additional income tax and VAT that is illegitimate and not payable.b.The Respondent failed to consider the Appellant’s accounts, invoices, audited financial statements, general ledgers, bank statements, reconciliations of the turnover and other related documents provided to it before demanding for additional VAT.c.That the Respondent erred in its decision by demanding additional VAT of Kshs.7,219,623.00.d.That the reasons advanced by the Respondent in invalidating the Appellant’s objection are vague, hollow and mere monologues whose objectives are chiseled only for purposes of collecting illegitimate taxes.Appellant’s Case7.The Appellant’s case is premised on the Statement of Facts dated 27thJuly 2023 and filed on 11thAugust 2023.8.The Appellant averred that on 15thFebruary 2023 it was issued with a notice of assessment followed by additional assessments dated 9thMay 2023 and 24thMay 2023 respectively.9.That the Appellant objected to the assessments on 3rdJune 2023 and provided all the additional information and documents as demanded by the Respondent but the latter failed to address the issues raised in the objection.10.The Appellant stated that even before the issuance of the said assessments, the parties held many working meetings and the Appellant provided all the documents for review as demanded by the Respondent.11.That on 16thJune 2023 the Respondent invalidated the Appellant's objection and demanded VAT of Kshs. 7,219,623.00 together with penalties and interest.12.That the Respondent did not comply with the provisions of theTax Procedures Actby invalidating the Appellant’s objection and therefore the tax decision is null and void ab initio.Appellant’s prayers13.The Appellant prayed to the Tribunal to find that the Appellant is not liable to pay any additional VAT of Kshs. 7,219.623.00 with regard to the tax period under review.The Respondent’s Case14.In response to the Appeal the Respondent presented its:a.Statement of Facts dated 3rdNovember 2023 and filed on 6thNovember 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.b.Written submissions dated 1stMarch 2024 and filed on 4thMarch 2024.15.The Respondent averred that it relied on Sections 3 of theIncome Tax Actand Section 5 of the VAT Act that provides for charge of tax by it.16.The Respondent also relied on Section 51(3) of theTax Procedures Act(TPA) and Section 23 of the TPA as read together with Section 59 of the TPA that require the Appellant to maintain documents required under any tax law and to provide the same upon request by the Respondent.17.The Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to provide the required documents for the objection application.18.The Respondent also submitted that it is trite law that the burden of proving that the assessments by the Respondent are incorrect, lies with the Appellant and that the Appellant had failed to discharge that burden. That this led to the issuance by the Respondent of the objection invalidation.19.The Respondent in support of its case relied on the holdings in Mulherin vs Commissioner of Taxation [2013] FCAFC 115, Commissioner of Domestic Services vs Galaxy Tools Ltd [2021] eKLR and TAT No.55 of 2018 Boleyn International Limited vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes.Respondent’s prayers20.The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal:a.Upholds the Respondent’s decision dated 16thJune 2023.b.Dismisses the Appeal with costs to the Respondent.Issues For Determination21.The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the parties, and considers the issues for determination to be as follows:a.Whether there is a valid appeal before the Tribunal.b.Whether the invalidation decision dated 16thJune 2023 is justified.Analysis And Findingsa. Whether there is a valid appeal before the Tribunal22.The Appellant upon being dissatisfied with the decision dated 16thJune 2023 filed its Notice of Appeal on 14thJuly 2023.23.The Tribunal notes that the procedure for appeal as set out in Section 13(1) (b) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act(TAT Act) requires that a notice of appeal shall be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.24.Consequently, the Appellant is required to abide by the provisions of Section 13(2) of the TAT Act which provides as follows:“The Appellant shall within fourteen days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, submit enough copies, as maybe advised by the Tribunal of –a.memorandum of appealb.statement of factsc.tax decision25.The Tribunal observes that the Appellant upon filing its Notice of Appeal on 14thJuly 2023 was as per Section 13(2) of the TAT Act expected to file its Memorandum of Appeal within fourteen days thereafter. The Appellant filed its Memorandum of Appeal on 11thAugust 2023, well outside the requisite time.26.The Tribunal further notes that the Appellant failed to apply for leave to file its Memorandum of Appeal out of time as required under Section 13(3) of the TAT Act which provides as follows:-“The Tribunal may, upon application in writing or through electronic means, extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).”27.The Tribunal is of the considered view that the timelines for appealing the Commissioner’s decisions are clearly set out in the law, and taxpayers are liable to comply with the same.28.The Tribunal reiterates its holding in the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. TheCommissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No. 247 of 2020] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -“Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed bythe constitutionor an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”29.The Tribunal is also guided on the adherence to timelines by the case ofEastleigh Mall Limited v Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement (Income Tax Appeal E068 of 2020) [2023] KEHC 20000 (KLR) where the court held that: -“... Parliament in its wisdom knew that in matters tax, time is very crucial as those in commerce need to make informed decisions. If the Commissioner is allowed to exercise his discretion and stay ad-infinitum before issuing an objection decision, the tax payer would be unable to make crucial decisions and plan his/her business properly. The timelines set are mandatory and not a procedural technicality.”30.Based on the law and the case laws cited above, the Tribunal finds that there is no valid appeal before it as the Memorandum of Appeal in the matter was filed out of time and without leave of the Tribunal.

      [2024] KETAT 1233 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Tax Appeal TribunalCivilAppeal E475 of 2023E.N Wafula, Chair & G Ogaga, MemberAugust 23, 2024BetweenJasir Contractors LimitedAppellantandCommissioner of Domestic TaxesRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant is a private limited liability company incorporated in Kenya under theCompanies Act. Its principal activity is providing contracting services.2.The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of theKenya Revenue Authority Act, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya (KRA Act).

In that letter, the Respondent stated that the effective date of the Appellant’s objection application was 25thMay 2023.6.The Respondent issued the Appellant with an objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 partially allowing the Appellant’s objection.7.Dissatisfied with the Respondent’s objection decision, the Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal on 7thAugust 2023.The Appeal8.The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal dated 9thAugust 2023 and filed on 14thAugust 2023 which raised the following grounds: -a.That the Commissioner fell into serious error of fact and law in purporting to issue the objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 when the assessment was excessively high and unreasonable.b.That the Commissioner fell into serious error of fact and law in purporting to issue the objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 and not considering the explanation and evidence adduced by the Appellant in its objection.c.That the Commissioner’s additional assessment and demand of Kshs. 12,140,000.00 is erroneous and wrong as the supplies and services alleged to have been done to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation during the period of January 2017 to September 2021 did not take place since the company did not receive any payment and Meru County consolidated invoices confirm a different status for that period.d.That during the execution of the project that existed between the Meru County Investment and Development Corporation and the Appellant there was an attraction of 10% labour component in the actual figure made to pay casual labourers on a weekly basis and the same could not be subjected to PAYE.e.That the 5% component for some materials was not avertable as the same was from a quarry and did not have any invoices and receipts from the suppliers.f.That the Commissioner erred in fact and in law in finding that tax of Kshs. 4,242,531.00 was due from and payable by the Appellant, which amount is not premised on any legal, logical or arithmetic correctness or precision.g.That the Commissioner predisposed itself to a position favourable to it in the decision appealed against herein resulting in a manifestly unfair, flawed and unbalanced decision.h.That in overall regard to the foregoing grounds. the decision of the Commissioner is unconstitutional, illegal, unreasonable, wrong in law and unjust in effect.Appellant’s Case9.The Appellant’s case is premised on the Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 9thAugust 2023 and filed on 14thAugust 2023 and the documents attached to it.10.The Appellant stated that on 10thJuly 2023 the Respondent issued an objection decision to the Appellant demanding a total tax amount of Kshs. 4,242,531.00 for the period from 2018 to 2021.11.The Appellant averred that by a letter dated 27thJuly 2022, it objected to the VAT assessment of the Respondent. That on 10thJuly 2023, the Respondent issued the Appellant with an objection decision rejecting the explanations and evidence adduced by the Appellant.12.The Appellant further stated that by the same decision, the Respondent proceeded to wrongfully. unreasonably and unconstitutionally, demand from the Appellant the sum of Kshs. 4,242,531.00, being the sum of VAT arrears purported to be due and owing to the Respondent.13.The Appellant averred that the said principal tax of Kshs. 4,242,531.00 demanded is illegal, since the Appellant provided all the supporting documents to the Respondent.14.The Appellant added that it was very aggrieved by the Respondent’s objection decision and that the Respondent’s conduct aforesaid was extremely punitive and unreasonable.Appellant’s prayers15.The Appellant prayed for the following orders from the Tribunal: -a.That the Respondent’s objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 be and is hereby set aside in its entirety.b.That an order be and is hereby issued restraining the Commissioner, its employees, agents, or other persons purporting to act on its behalf or under its instructions from enforcing and/or collecting the sum of Kshs. 4,242,531.00 from the Appellantc.That the cost of this Appeal be borne by the Commissioner.d.That the Tribunal be at liberty to grant any other or further remedies that it deems just and reasonable to grant in the circumstances.Respondent’s Case16.The Respondent’s case is premised on the following documents:a.Its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 14thSeptember 2023 and the documents attached to it; andb.Its written submissions dated 1stMarch 2024 and filed on 4thMarch 2024.17.The Respondent stated that from the data it extracted from withholding VAT certificates from the taxpayer’s PIN, it established that for the period January 2017 to September 2021, the Appellant offered services and made supplies to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation amounting to Kshs. 109,917,366.00 and failed to account for the applicable taxes.18.The Respondent issued the Appellant with a demand notice on 15thFebruary 2022 demanding payment of the taxes within 7 days.19.The Respondent raised a VAT assessment order Kshs. 15,352,946.40 for the period of September 2021 on 28thJune 2022, which the Appellant objected to on the KRA iTax portal on 23rdMay 2023.20.The Respondent stated that it extracted data from the Appellant on sales declared in the Appellant’s returns and purchases claimed by the Appellant for the years 2017 to 2021, which it further analysed and noted that there were under-declarations of sales relating to supplies made to Meru County even after reconciliation and factoring in the sales declared, input VAT claimed and the tax credits from withholding VAT in the period under review.21.The Respondent averred that the Appellant failed to satisfactorily support its objection as required, resulting in the Respondent only partially accepting the objection for the period 2017 to 2021 and amending the VAT assessments to a total of Kshs. 4,242,531.00, being Kshs. 521,513.00 for 2018, Kshs. 1,499,263.00 for 2019, Kshs. 279,355.00 for 2020 and Kshs. 1,942,400.00 for 2021 as presented in the objection decision rendered by the Respondent in a letter dated 10thJuly 2023.22.Being dissatisfied with the objection decision, the Appellant filed an Appeal.23.In response to the grounds of appeal, the Respondent relied on Section 5 of theValue Added Tax Actthat provides for charge of tax.24.The Respondent also relied on Section 17 of theValue Added Tax Actthat provides for credit for input tax against output tax.25.The Respondent referred to Section 59 of theTax Procedures Actthat empowers the Respondent to seek any information relating to the ascertaining of the correct tax liability of an Appellant.26.The Respondent also relied on Section 51 of theTax Procedures Actthat provides for issuing of an objection decision and mandates the Respondent to issue the same.27.The Respondent stated that the Appellant failed to provide the required documentation thus failed in discharging its burden of proof contrary to Section 56 of theTax Procedures Act, leading to the Respondent issuing the objection decision.28.The Respondent asserted that the law is very clear that the burden of proof is always on the taxpayer, and that in this case, the Appellant has not produce any evidence to support the averments contained in its statement of facts.29.The Respondent finally submitted that until the burden of proof is discharged by the Appellant to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, this Appeal should be dismissed.Respondent’s prayers30.The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal:a.Upholds the Respondent’s objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 as proper and in conformity with the provisions of the law.b.That this Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.Issue for Determination31.The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the parties, and considers the issue for determination as follows:Whether the Respondent was justified in issuing its Objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023.Analysis And Findings32.The Tribunal analysed the issue that calls for its determination as hereunder, having reviewed all the pleadings, information and documents adduced by the Appellant and the Respondent concerning the impugned objection decision.33.The Appellant disputed the Respondent’s additional assessments in the objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 by averring the following:a.That the Respondent’s assessment and demand of Kshs. 12,140,000.00 was erroneous as the Appellant did not provide services to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation and did not receive any payment. That the Meru County consolidated invoices confirm a different status for the period of January 2017 to September 2021.b.That during the execution of the project the Appellant undertook for the Meru County Investment and Development Corporation, there was an attraction of 10% labour component in the actual figure made to pay casual labourers on a weekly basis and the same could not be subjected PAYE.c.That the 5% component for some materials was not avertable as the same was from a quarry and did not have any invoices and receipts from the suppliers.d.That the tax of Kshs. 4,242,531.00 assessed by the Respondent is not premised on any legal, logical or arithmetic correctness or precision, and is illegal, since the Appellant provided all the supporting documents to the Respondent.34.The Respondent stated that from the data it extracted from withholding VAT certificates from the taxpayer’s PIN, it established that for the period January 2017 to September 2021, the Appellant offered services and made supplies to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation amounting to Kshs. 109,917,366.00 and failed to account for the applicable taxes.35.The Respondent issued the Appellant with a demand notice on 15thFebruary 2022 demanding payment of the taxes within 7 days.36.The Respondent raised a VAT assessment order of Kshs. 15,352,946.40 for the period of September 2021 on 28thJune 2022 which the Appellant objected to on the KRA iTax portal on 23rdMay 2023.37.The Respondent stated that it extracted data from the Appellant on sales declared in the Appellant’s returns and purchases claimed by the Appellant for the years 2017 to 2021, which it further analysed and noted there were under-declarations of sales relating to supplies made to Meru County even after reconciliation and factoring in the sales declared, input VAT claimed and the tax credits from Withholding VAT in the period under review, being years 2017 to 2021.38.The Respondent stated that the Appellant failed to satisfactorily support its objection as required, resulting in the Respondent only partially accepting the objection for the period 2017 to 2021 and amending the VAT assessments to a total of Kshs. 4,242,531.00, being Kshs. 521,513.00 for 2018, Kshs. 1,499,263.00 for 2019, Kshs. 279,355.00 for 2020 and Kshs. 1,942,400.00 for 2021 as presented in the objection decision rendered by the Respondent in a letter dated 10thJuly 2023.39.The key issue in the present case is the question of documentation to substantiate that the Appellant accurately accounted for and remitted the tax on supplies that it made to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation. The parties had opposing arguments regarding the sufficiency of the documents that the Appellant provided in support of its case.40.Section 56(1) of theTax Procedures Actand Section 30 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) Act place the burden of disproving the Commissioner upon the taxpayer. To satisfy this burden, a taxpayer ought to submit all the relevant evidentiary material in its possession.41.The substantive law under which the Respondent assessed the Appellant is the VAT Act, which provides as follows in Section 62 of the Act regarding burden of proof in tax disputes: -“In any civil proceedings under this Act, the burden of proving that any tax has been paid or that any goods or services are exempt from payment of tax shall lie on the person liable to pay the tax or claiming that the tax has been paid or that the goods or services are exempt from payment of tax.”42.The Tribunal refers to the case ofCommissioner of Domestic Taxes v Trical and Hard Limited (Tax Appeal E146 of 2020) [2022] KEHC 9927 (KLR) where the Court held at paragraph26that: -“From the above, it is clear that the evidential burden of proof rests with the taxpayer to disprove the Commissioner and that once competent and relevant evidence is produced, then this burden now shifts to the Commissioner. I have emphasized and underlined ‘competence’ and ‘relevance’ because it is only evidence that meets these two tests that demolishes presumption of correctness and swings the burden to the Commissioner. This means that even if one avails evidence but then it is found that the same is incompetent or irrelevant, then the burden continues to remain with the tax payer.”43.In the absence of relevant documentation to facilitate the assessment of a tax liability, the Respondent is empowered under Section 31(1) of theTax Procedures Act(TPA) to use its best judgement in making its tax assessment.44.The Tribunal notes that the Respondent extrapolated sales data in respect of supplies made by the Appellant to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation for the period under review from withholding tax certificates in the Appellant’s tax account, which sales data the Appellant corroborated as correct.45.The Tribunal further observes that the Appellant only presented its email correspondences with the Respondent during the review of the Appellant’s objection as evidence for consideration in this Appeal. The Tribunal, therefore, considered only the documents that the Appellant furnished in the Appeal to establish if they were sufficient to persuade a reasonable person that the Respondent’s assessment of the Appellant’s tax liability was erroneous.46.Section 43 of the VAT Act, 2013 which provides that: -“(1)A person shall, for the purposes of this Act, keep in the course of his business, a full and true written record, whether in electronic form or otherwise, in English or Kiswahili of every transaction he makes and the record shall be kept in Kenya for a period of five years from the date of the last entry made therein.(2)The records to be kept under subsection (1) shall include—(a)copies of all tax invoices and simplified tax invoices issued in serial copies number order;(b)of all credit and debit notes issued, in chronological order;(c)…;(d)details of the amounts of tax charged on each supply made or received and in relation to all services to which section 10 applies, sufficient written evidence to identify the supplier and the recipient, and to show the nature and quantity of services supplied, the time of supply, the place of supply, the consideration for the supply, and the extent to which the supply has been used by the recipient for a particular purpose;(e)tax account showing the totals of the output tax and the input tax in each period and a net total of the tax payable or the excess tax carried forward, as the case may be, at the end of each period;(f)copies of stock records kept periodically as the Commissioner may determine;(g)details of each supply of goods and services from the business premises, unless such details are available at the time of supply on invoices issued at, or before, that time; and(h)such other accounts or records as may be specified, in writing, by the Commissioner.(3)Every person required under subsection (1) to keep records shall, at all reasonable times, avail the records to an authorised officer for inspection and shall give the officer every facility necessary to inspect the records.envisions that a person carrying on a business must keep certain records and documents and avail the same to the Commissioner for inspection.47.Section 23(1) of theTax Procedures Actfurther provides that a taxpayer is required to keep records as follows: -“A person shall—(a)maintain any document required under a tax law, in either of the official languages;(b)maintain any document required under a tax law so as to enable the person's tax liability to be readily ascertained; and(c)subject to subsection (3), retain the document for a period of five years from the end of the reporting period to which it relates or such shorter period as may be specified in a tax law.”48.The Tribunal’s examination of the evidence presented by the Appellant in the Appeal reveals that the Appellant failed to adduce source documents required of it under Section 43 of the VAT Act and Section 23 of theTax Procedures Act, including sales invoices, a VAT account, general ledgers, and other relevant records to support its averments on how it had accounted for and settled the VAT on the taxable value of its supplies to Meru County Investment and Development Corporation during the period of January 2017 to September 2021.49.The Tribunal also notes that the Appellant failed to adduce its VAT returns and tax payment confirmations to demonstrate how it declared the said income and how it accounted for and remitted VAT on the taxable value of the supplies.50.The Tribunal finds that despite the law under Section 62 of the VAT Act, Section 56(1) of theTax Procedures Actand Section 30 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Actexpressly placing a burden on the Appellant as a taxpayer to prove its case, the Appellant instead opted to exercise excessive abbreviation in arguing its case by filing evidence that was not impactful in persuading the Tribunal to arrive at a determination different from that in the Respondent’s objection decision.51.Due to the Appellant’s failure to provide critical transactional documents in support of its transactions with Meru County Investment and Development Corporation during the period of January 2017 to September 2021, the Tribunal was unable to ascertain the correctness of the Appellant’s assertions in this case.52.Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof to demonstrate that the Respondent’s additional assessment of VAT was incorrect or excessive as required under Section 62 of the VAT Act, Section 56(1) of the TPA and Section 30 of the TAT Act.53.Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was justified in issuing the objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023.Final Decision54.The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Tribunal finds that the Appeal lacks merit and accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -a.The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.b.The Respondent’s objection decision dated 10thJuly 2023 be and is hereby upheld.c.Each party to bear its own costs.55.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 23RD DAY OF AUGUST, 2024.ERIC NYONGESA WAFULACHAIRMANGLORIA A.

      [2024] KECA 1045 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Court of Appeal at NyeriCriminal Appeal 74 of 2017W Karanja, J Mohammed & AO Muchelule, JJAApril 12, 2024BetweenPeter Kinyua MuriukiAppellantandRepublicRespondent(Being an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Kerugoya (L. W. Gitari, J.) dated 10th May, 2017 in HCCRA No. 24 of 2016)Judgment1.The appellant, Peterson Kinyua Muriuki, was charged before the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Baricho for the offence of defilement of a girl contrary to Section 8(1)(3) (sic) of theSexual Offences Act. The particulars of the offence were that on 14thJanuary, 2015 at [Particulars withheld] village, Kirinyaga West District within Kirinyaga County, he intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of ENM, a child aged 15 years.2.At the trial, the prosecution called five (5) witnesses in support of its case. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant was found guilty of the offence of defilement, convicted and sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment.3.Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, the appellant filed an appeal before the High Court at Kerugoya (L. W. Gitari, J.). The appeal was unsuccessful prompting the instant appeal against both conviction and sentence.4.The appellant complained that the 1stappellate court erred in law: by finding that the prosecution proved its case against him beyond any shadow of doubt; by failing to consider that identification of the appellant was not properly done to the required standard; by relying on a medical report that was done two weeks after the incident; and that the police did not visit the alleged crime scene.5.Further grounds were that the 1stappellate court relied on scanty and contradictory evidence; failed to consider that the trial court did not comply with Section 211 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC); that the age of the victim ought to have been indicated as 16 years and not 15 years; and that the 1stappellate court erred in law when it failed to consider his defence.6.The jurisdiction of this Court on a second appeal is well settled. In Karani v Republic [2010] 1 KLR 73, this Court expressed itself as follows: -“This is a second appeal. By dint of the provisions of section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code, we are enjoined to consider only matters of law. We cannot interfere with the decision of the Superior Court on facts unless it is demonstrated that the trial court and the first appellate court considered matters they ought not to have considered or that they failed to consider matters they should have considered or that looking at the evidence as a whole they were plainly wrong in their decision, in which case such omission or commission would be treated as matters of law.”7.It is against that jurisdictional remit that we shall briefly examine the evidence that was tendered before the trial court and re-examined by the High Court in reaching the impugned judgment.8.ENM (PW1), the complainant gave sworn evidence after a voire dire examination where the trial court found that she was intelligent and understood the solemnity of an oath and ordered that she give sworn evidence.9.It was PW1’s evidence that on the 14thJanuary, 2015 at about 4pm, she was sent by her grandmother with whom she lived, to the councillor of Kibirigwi area to take her bursary form. It was her testimony that on her way there she met with the appellant who was riding a motorcycle. That he enquired where she was going and he offered to take her to her destination. It was her evidence that she initially declined and subsequently accepted the ride and he dropped her at the councilor’s office and waited for her. It was her evidence that the appellant offered her a ride back home but she declined and proceeded to run other errands. It was her testimony that he again offered her a ride home and she accepted but instead of taking her home, he diverted to a different route.10.It was her further evidence that the appellant took her to a homestead where he alighted from the motorcycle and forcefully pulled her by her right hand and took her to a two-roomed house. It was her evidence that he locked the door and placed his motorcycle against it to block her escape. It was her further evidence that he made indecent advances to her which she resisted. That he switched on the radio and put it on high volume and proceeded to defile her.11.It was PW1’s further evidence that after the ordeal, he offered to take her home and she agreed and he dropped her a short distance from her home. That she found her grandmother at home but was unable to tell her what had happened to her out of fear. It was her further testimony that she felt unwell and sought treatment at a nearby dispensary. Further, that she was feeling mentally disturbed and was considering committing suicide and asked her aunt for rat poison. PW1 testified that her aunt did not have rat poison and she proceeded to a neighbour’s house, one Isaiah where she found a jerrican of petrol. It was her further testimony that she carried with her a cup full of petrol. That she subsequently informed her grandmother that she had been defiled and was taken to the police station and subsequently to the hospital for treatment. It was her further evidence that subsequently, she was informed that the appellant had been arrested. It was her further evidence that that she identified the appellant as the perpetrator.12.PW2 EMM, the complainant’s grandmother testified that on the material day at about 4pm, she sent the complainant to take her bursary form to the councilor and run a few errands. That the complainant returned home at about 7.30pm resulting in PW2 picking a stick to cane PW1 but decided against it when PW1 informed her that she had attended a crusade. PW2 further testified that the following day, PW1 informed her that she was feeling unwell whereupon PW2 gave her money to seek medical treatment. It was PW2’s further testimony that the following day she returned home unexpectedly and found PW1 with motor vehicle oil in a cup which she threatened to drink and started crying. PW2 testified that PW1 disclosed to her that on the day that she had said that she had attended a crusade, the appellant had defiled her at his house and that she was afraid that PW2 would cane her. PW2 testified that she informed PW1’s father (PW3) about the defilement and they reported the matter at the police station where PW1 identified the appellant as the perpetrator. Subsequently, she took PW1 to the hospital for examination and treatment. PW2 testified that the appellant was known to her as a motorcycle operator.13.JMM (PW3) who was PW1’s father testified that on 26thJanuary, 2015, PW2 called him and informed him that PW1 had been defiled. That on 27thJanuary, 2015 he met PW1 and PW2 and proceeded to the police station and subsequently to the hospital. PW3 further testified that PW1 informed him that she was defiled by the appellant who was known to PW3 as he had seen him in their neighbourhood.14.Dr. Makori Obed (PW4) of Karatina sub-county Hospital testified on behalf of Dr. Wahome who had examined PW1. The medical report indicated that a pregnancy test was negative and PW1’s hymen was broken. PW4 testified that Dr. Wahome had made a finding that PW1 had been defiled.15.PC Jane Losusu (PW5) of Baricho Police Station was the Investigations Officer. She testified that on 28thJanuary, 2015 she was assigned PW1’s case. That PW1 narrated to her that the appellant had defiled her leading to his arrest. It was her testimony that she obtained PW1’s birth certificate which indicated that PW1 was born on 11thFebruary, 199 and was therefore 15 years old when she was defiled.16.The appellant was put on his defence and gave sworn evidence and called no witness. He denied that he had defiled PW1 and stated that he had been framed as he was a witness in a case.Submissions by Counsel17.At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was unrepresented and relied on his written submissions. He submitted that this is his last appeal and that he did not commit the offence for which he was convicted and sentenced.18.In his written submissions, the appellant submitted that the complainant was not a truthful witness as she reported the matter more than 13 days after the incident. Further, that the complainant did not disclose to anybody that she had been defiled but told her grandmother that she had attended a crusade.19.The appellant further submitted that the trial court did not warn itself of the danger of convicting on the basis of a single identifying witness; and that he was not accorded a fair trial as the prosecution evidence was not watertight. The appellant further submitted that the prosecution failed to prove its case and that the trial court did not consider his defence that there was a grudge between him and one MW who was related to PW1’s family who sought to frame him to deter him from testifying against her.20.On sentence, the appellant stated that at the time the offence was committed, PW1 was 16 years old and the sentence imposed on him should therefore be reconsidered. He urged this Court to allow his appeal on conviction and sentence.21.Mr. Naulikha, learned counsel for the State submitted that the complainant and the appellant knew each other. It was his submission that the identity of the perpetrator was not in dispute as the appellant and the complainant were together for a period of about 2 to 3 hours largely in the appellant’s house. Counsel submitted that it was a case of identification by recognition as the complainant knew the appellant having seen him in the neighbourhood.22.Counsel further submitted that the prosecution proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt. That the prosecution called the complainant as PW1, the grandmother (PW2), who was PW1’s custodian and the doctor (PW4) who produced the medical report of the doctor who examined and treated PW1. Counsel asserted that the prosecution evidence was overwhelming, consistent, cogent and corroborated each other in all material ways. Counsel submitted that there were no contradictions or inconsistencies in the prosecution evidence.23.Counsel further submitted that the identification of the appellant by the complainant was done to the required standard. Counsel emphasized that the incident took place during the day and the complainant and the appellant spent more than one hour together. Counsel asserted that the complainant and the appellant knew each other well. Counsel further asserted that the complainant knew the appellant prior to the incident and the evidence was that of recognition as opposed to that of identification.24.On the ground that the age of the complainant was 16 years and not 15 years as contended by the appellant, counsel submitted that from the evidence on record, the age of the complainant at the time of the incident was 15 years.25.In conclusion, counsel urged that the appellant’s second appeal to this Court should be dismissed both on conviction and sentence.Determination26.We have considered the record of appeal, the submissions, the authorities cited and the law. The appellant was charged with the offence of defilement. It is settled law that to warrant conviction for an offence of defilement under Section 8(1) of theSexual Offences Actthree elements should be satisfied before conviction of an accused person can arise. These are proof of penetration, the age of the victim, and the identity of the perpetrator. See: John Mutua Munyoki vs. Republic [2017] eKLR.27.We discern the issues arising for determination in this appeal are whether the charge against the appellant was proved to the required standard; and whether there were material contradictions in the evidence that ought to have been resolved in favour of the appellant.28.It is evident that the appellant’s conviction was hinged on the evidence of PW1, a minor who upon the trial court conducting voire dire gave sworn evidence. PW1 testified that she was defiled by the appellant, a person who was well-known to her. She informed her grandmother (PW2) who informed her father (PW3), who both knew the appellant as he was a boda boda rider in their neighbourhood. PW2’s testimony was consistent with that of PW1. In the circumstances, the appellant’s contention that the prosecution evidence was contradictory cannot hold as the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW4 was sufficient to prove the charge against the appellant.29.Section 124 of theEvidence Actprovides as follows:-“Corroboration required in criminal cases.Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19 of theOaths and Statutory Declarations Act(Cap. 15), where the evidence of the alleged victim is admitted in accordance with that section on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings against any person for an offence, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted on such evidence unless it is corroborated by other material evidence in support thereof implicating him:Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.”30.This Court in Mohammed V Republic [2006] 2KLR, 138, this Court held that:“It is now well settled that the courts shall no longer be hum strung by requirements of corroboration where the victim of a sexual offence is a child of tender years if it is satisfied that the child is truthful.”31.The trial court accepted PW1’s evidence as truthful and in its judgment stated as follows:-“I had the opportunity of observing the demeanor of the witnesses herein, especially the complainant. She gave a narration of the circumstances surrounding the incidents (sic) which I consider vivid and true. Her evidence remained consistent even on cross-examination.”32.On the question of proof of penetration, it is clear from the record that the complainant’s testimony was corroborated by medical evidence. PW4 testified that the medical examination revealed that there was penetration and produced the P3 form.33.Regarding the identification of the appellant, PW1 identified the appellant as the person who had defiled her. From the record, it is a case of identification by recognition as the appellant and PW1, PW2 and PW3 lived in the same neighbourhood.34.On the question of PW1’s age, we find that the same was proved by the evidence of PW5 who testified that the complainant was born on 11thFebruary, 1999 as per the birth certificate that was produced in evidence. Further, the P3 form indicated the age of the complainant as 15 years.35.The totality of the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3, PW4 and PW5, therefore, provided overwhelming evidence against the appellant and was consistent, cogent and corroborative. We are satisfied that all the ingredients of the offence of defilement were established to the required standard and that the concurrent findings of the two courts below were based on credible evidence. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that in light of the overwhelming evidence adduced against the appellant, his defence denying committing the offence of defilement was properly rejected. His conviction was, therefore, sound.36.On sentence, it was confirmed by the production of PW1’s birth certificate that she was 15 years old at the time the offence was committed.37.Section 8(3) of theSexual Offences Actprovides as follows:“8(3)A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years.”38.Accordingly, we find that the sentence meted out on the appellant by the trial court and upheld by the 1stappellate court was lawful.39.Accordingly, we find no basis to interfere with the findings of the trial court as upheld by the High Court. The upshot is that the appeal is devoid of merit and is dismissed in its entirety.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 12THDAY OF APRIL, 2024.W.

      [2024] KEHC 10222 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at Nairobi (Milimani Law Courts)FamilyAdoption Cause E096 of 2024BM Nzakyo, JAugust 13, 2024IN THE MATTER OF CHILD RKIn the matter ofRGG1stApplicantDLMG2ndApplicantJudgment1.The 1stapplicant is a maternal uncle to the child while the 2ndapplicant is wife to the 1stapplicant. This is therefore a kinship adoption. I have made this statement because I have noted that the applicants are aged 32 and 33 years respectively whereas the child is aged 15. That means that the restriction of age difference between the applicants and the child herein does not, by virtue of provisions of Section 186(3) of theChildren Actapply.2.The child was born to DAG and EO on 16-07-2008. This court was told by the mother of the child that the father of the child has never been in the life of the child since she was born. The child’s mother said that she fully depends on the applicants for the upkeep and maintenance of the child. The child’s mother gave out the child for adoption through Change Trust. Upon inquiries, the said Change Trust declared the child free for adoption on 2-02-2024 and issued a certificate to that effect serial number xxxxx. The certificate was produced in court by Lizzie M. Agala.3.The applicants testified separately and told the court that they understood the effect of an adoption order. They said that they are aware that once the adoption order is issued, the same is irreversible and gives the child the rights like those of their biological children which includes the right to inherit them. Their motivation for this adoption was their desire to give the child a better life. It was their evidence that they have been supporting the child for long and have had a good rapport with her. It was the applicants’ intention to continue supporting the child in her education and all other needs in life. The 1stapplicant is a Kenyan citizen whereas the 2ndapplicant is an American. The applicants produced evidence to show that they were financially stable and were able to support the child.4.The mother of the child appeared in court and confirmed that she had given consent to the applicants to adopt the child. She affirmed that she has never met the biological father of the child for over ten years. She confirmed that the applicants have been supporting the child in the absence of the father. It was her evidence that she was not able to sustain the child. It was her position that the child can have a better future in the hands of the applicants and she willingly gave her away to enable the child have a brighter future than she could give her. This was because she had two other children who were taking a toll on her resources. Her written consent dated 18-04-2024 is part of the court record.5.When asked by this court about the whereabouts of the father of the child, D stated that she has never seen him for more than ten years although she was aware that he hailed from Kisumu County. She added that they were never married. She confirmed that she will be responsible for the child’s upkeep and responsibilities in case the adopting parents are incapable or not available for the child. In other words, she has consented and is willing to act as the Legal Guardian of the child.6.Harriet Kihara is a Principal Children Officer working in the Department of Children Services. She told the court that the department carried out inquiries on the suitability of the applicants in adopting the child. From the interview conducted by the department, they found the applicants fit to adopt the child and proceeded to recommend that the adoption orders be granted. She however admitted that they did not visit the home of the applicants but interviewed them online.7.The child also testified. She told the court that she knew the applicants as her uncle and aunt. She confirmed that they have been supporting her for long and she was aware that the current proceedings were about the applicants adopting her. She stated that she had no objection to the adoption and she had consented without any pressure. She was also aware that the adoption order once given is not reversible. She added that whenever the applicants are in the country, they visit and spend time with her.8.Lizzie Mbogo Agala from Change Trust confirmed that the applicants were their clients. She stated that they interviewed the applicants in respect of this particular matter and the outcome thereof reduced into a report dated 2-02-2024. She produced the report which was positive in that it recommended and approved that the applicants be allowed to adopt the child herein.9.SKW an advocate of the High Court of Kenya was on 2-05-2024 appointed as the Guardian Ad Litem in this matter. He stated that he knew the 1stapplicant since their secondary school days in [Particulars withheld] High School. He upon appointment conducted his duties and prepared a report on the suitability of the applicants and wellbeing of the child. He testified that he had interacted with the child and he found her to be happy and very interested in being adopted by the applicants. He produced his report dated 28-05-2024 in which he recommends the adoption.10.Having gone through the reports indicated above and having listened to the witnesses herein especially the applicants and the child, I have no doubt that this is a good case to grant. The child is known to the applicants for a long time. She is the 1stapplicant’s niece meaning that none of them is a stranger to the other. The child is fifteen years and able to know what is good for her. She attends school and she has shown interest in pursuing more studies. This being a kinship adoption, the child will still remain within the family. Better still, the appointed Legal Guardian is the child’s mother who has given her out for adoption to her brother. This can only mean that the adoption herein is not for the applicant’s or the mother’s benefit but the desire to give the child a better future. With that kind of arrangement, the family ties remain stronger if not stronger than before.11.On the other hand, the biological father cannot be traced. The only known details of him is that he hailed from Kisumu County. He has been an absentee father right after the child was born. He has not been in the child’s life. He has never made any contribution to her growth or development. Instead, he left his parental responsibilities to the mother and other maternal relatives. Obviously, he must have moved on with his life if he is still living.12.In my opinion, the requirement of consent of the biological parent under Section 186(8)(a) of theChildren Act, Chapter 141 of the Laws of Kenya is to ensure that the rights of the parents are not violated and ensure that they are given a chance or right of say in their children’s affairs. The requirement is not meant to be a barrier or an obstacle to enhancing and promoting the rights and welfare of the child. Parents’ rights accrue to those who are available and concerned about their children. An absentee parent has no right to stand on the way when the child’s welfare is being enhanced and promoted by others. In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in dispensing with the consent of the biological father of the child under Section 189(1)(a) of the Children’s Act Chapter 141 of the Laws of Kenya.13.In view of the above, I am convinced that it will be in the best interest of the child that this adoption be allowed. I consequently allow the originating summons dated 18thApril 2024 in the following terms;1.The consent of the child’s biological father is hereby dispensed with.2.RGG and Dominique LMG are hereby allowed to adopt R K.3.The child’s name shall remain RK.4.DAG is appointed as the Legal Guardian of the child.5.The Guardian Ad Litem is discharged.6.The Registrar General is directed to enter this adoption in the register of adoptions.DATED SIGNED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 13THDAY OF AUGUST 2024.B.M.

Muchemi, J.) dated 24th March 2022 in HCCC No. 14 of 2017)Judgment1.This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court (F. Muchemi, J.) dated 24thMarch 2022 at Nyeri in which the claim of Kshs. 25,334,118.34 plus interest and costs was awarded to the respondent Ndumberi General Merchants Limited, against the appellant Ewaso Ng’iro North Development Authority. The respondent claimed that it had, following agreement, constructed three (3) water pans for the appellant during the period between 2010 and 2012; that the works were worth Kshs.60,366,677.70; that the appellant had paid Kshs.35,032,559.36; and the outstanding balance was Kshs.25,334,118.34, which had been demanded but not paid.2.The appellant was not satisfied with the decision and appealed on the following grounds:-“1.That the learned Judge relied on a technicality to make a finding against the appellant.2.That the learned Judge erred in law by failing to consider and apply the principles of the Law of Contract laid down in the appellant’s submissions.3.That the learned Judge erred in law by failing to acknowledge the principle of quantum meruit and the fact that the respondent did not perform its tasks to completion as per the Local Service Order hence was not entitled to the balance of the amount payable.4.That the learned Judge erred in law by failing to acknowledge the extent of Agency-Principal relationship by upholding the fact that the payment was based on the certificate that was issued by the professional consultants, yet the consultants issued the same without the authority of their principal.5.That the learned Judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the law appropriately.6.That the learned Judge erred in law by violating the appellant’s right to fair trial.7.The judgment of the learned Judge was against the weight of evidence and facts adduced and was not just in rejecting the appellant’s defence.8.The learned Judge erred in law and fact by failing to consider the appellant’s defence when arriving at her judgment.”It was sought that the judgment and decision be revised, varied and/or set aside.3.This is a first appeal. Our duty is to analyse the evidence that was tendered before the trial court afresh, re-evaluate it and reach our own independent conclusion thereon, while bearing in mind that the court had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses who appeared before it. (See John Teleylo Ole Sawoyo -vs- David Omwenga Maobe [2013] eKLR. In Ephantus Mwangi & Another -vs- Duncan Mwangi Wambugu [1982-1988] I KAR 27 at page 292, this Court stated as follows:-“A Court of Appeal will not normally interfere with a finding of fact by the trial court unless it is based on no evidence or on a misapprehension of the evidence or the Judge is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching the findings he did.”4.Put differently, this Court cannot substitute the factual findings by the trial court with its own unless it is evident that there was no evidence on which the trial court based its findings or unless the court was plainly wrong. (See Kiruga -vs- Kiruga & Another [1988] KLR 348).5.There was no dispute that the appellant issued three Local Service Orders (LSOs) as follows:a.LSO dated 6thApril 2011 for Ackam Water Pan, requiring the respondent to excavate a 7,500cm3cofferdam and excavating 25,000cm3pan for the consideration of Kshs.14,751,256/=;b.LSO dated 6thApril 2011 for Kiharo Water Pan, requiring the respondent to excavate a 7,500 cm3copper dam and excavating 35,000cm3 pan for the consideration of Kshs.19,290,104/=; andc.LSO dated 6thApril 2011 for Karimeno Water Pan, requiring the respondent to excavate a 7500cm3copper dam and excavating 35,000cm3 pan for the consideration of Kshs.11,500,617.50.6.The second uncontested issue was that the respondent appointed M/s Professional Consultants Limited, who were consultant engineers, to oversee the projects on its behalf; that the engineers issued interim certificates as the works progressed and practical completion certificates upon completion of the works; and that the appellant paid Kshs.35,023,559.36 towards the projects, which left a balance of Kshs.25,334,118.34 which the respondent claimed in the plaint dated 14thJuly 2017.7.The appellant’s defence dated 11thAugust 2017 denied that the amount in question was owed. This is what was pleaded by the appellant:“5)Further to paragraph 4 herein before, the defendant denies that the plaintiff denies it owes the plaintiff any outstanding amounts, as the work and labour agreed to be supplied, was not either in accordance with the orders given and/or of the highest and best workmanship and standard agreed on by the defendant.6)The defendant further states that, by reason of this premises the work and/or labour were worth far less than the amounts sought to be recovered and less than what the plaintiff has already been paid.7)The defendant specifically states that it had paid all monies due to the plaintiff and therefore the amounts claimed as outstanding balances are excessive and unreasonable.”8.According to the record, Christopher Kawai Kamau (PW 1), the respondent’s Managing Director, testified for the respondent, while Josiah Willie Mulwa (DW 1) and Lukah Kingori (DW 2) testified for the appellant. The two were the appellant’s Chief Technical Services and Operations Manager and Field Officer, respectively. The evidence of PW 1 was that the projects were carried out according to the LSOs and that both interim and completion certificates were issued by the consultant engineers, on the basis of which Kshs.35,032,5559.36 had been paid leaving a balance of Kshs.25,334,118.34 which the respondent had sued to recover.9.The evidence of DW 2 was that he visited the water projects in 2012 and observed that the water pans had not been excavated. He was alone when he visited the sites. He did a report to that effect. He, however, did not produce the report in evidence. He testified that he did not know that the appellant had engaged consultant engineers to supervise the works. According to DW 1, the pans were excavated but not to the required standard; that the works were not done properly, according to the beneficiary communities and the audit that was consequently carried out. He further testified that the certificates had been issued unprocedurally. As far as he was concerned, the projects were being supervised by the consulting engineers. He was not himself attached to the projects during the works.10.This is the evidence that the learned Judge considered and decided in favour of the respondent by finding that the contracted works had been done in accordance with the LSOs and as certified by the consulting engineers, and therefore the respondent was owed the claimed money.11.We have to consider and determine whether the evidence on record supported the learned Judge’s findings.12.The learned Judge took note of sections 107 to 109 of theEvidence Actregarding the burden of proof placed on the respondent, and the standard of proof that was to be discharged. The decision in D.T. Dobie Company (K) Limited -vs- Wanyonyi Wafula Chebukati [2014] eKLR in this regard was cited. The respondent was required to establish a probable case to be able to get the prayers in the plaint.13.As between DW 1 and DW 2, one was saying that a shoddy job was done and the other was saying no job at all was done. One knew that the projects were being supervised by consultant engineers and the other had no idea that there were engineers supervising the projects. DW 1 was not the officer assigned to the projects. The officer who was assigned to the projects was not called, and there is no evidence that he was sanctioned if no works were carried out or that the works had not properly carried out. Similarly, if the completion certificates were issued irregularly, were the consulting engineers sanctioned?14.According to DW 1, the audit that discovered that the works had not been carried out properly was conducted in 2018. If DW 2 had in 2012 discovered that no water pans had been excavated, why didn’t this prompt immediate audit? Would the results of the audit have been different if it was carried out in 2012, 2013, or 2014?15.Against the evidence by DW 1 and DW 2, PW 1’s version was consistent that the respondent was issued with LSOs; the works were performed as per the LSOs; the works were supervised by the consulting engineers as agreed; the consulting engineers were satisfied with the works; the engineers certified the works; the appellant made part payment; and there was a balance of Kshs.25,334,118.34.16.In conclusion, we find that the complaint by the appellant as contained in the grounds of appeal lacked any basis. The evidence supported the findings by the learned Judge. Consequently, the appeal lacks merits and is dismissed with costs.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.P.

I cannot therefore make orders that are likely to impact on a matter that I am informed is still pending before a judge of concurrent jurisdiction.12.The learned Lady Justice Githua is seized of the matter and it is my considered view that the court would be best suited to deal with all the issues arising as a result of investigations in the matter and disposal of exhibits.13.Whereas I agree that the continued detention of the motor vehicle may constitute denial of the right to property, the right to that property is being limited for a legitimate purpose in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya.14.The right to a fair hearing is not derogable by dint of the provisions of Article 25 ofthe Constitution.15.This court is alive to its duty to safeguard the interests of justice protect and uphold the rights of all the accused persons.16.It is not possible for this court to tell what would be the impact of release of the exhibit at this stage and reiterate that since the matter is still pending before another judge, common decency would dictate that I decline proceeding to consider the notice of motion at this stage.17.In the end I find that this is not a matter of utmost urgency in the circumstances.

Cherono,J. delivered a judgment in KerugoyaELCno. 133 of 2017 Kenfrey Gitonga Munyua v Jam Auto Spares & 2 others in favour of the respondent herein and which effect was to grant the suit properties which has structures constructed on it to the 1strespondent.b.The applicant being aggrieved by the said judgment lodged its Notice of Appeal dated 26thMay 2023 before the Environment and Land Court (ELC) at Kerugoya and applied for proceedings.c.The grounds of appeal are that theELCjudge erred in law and in fact in:i.finding that the appellant’s case was not supported by evidence on record;ii.finding that the appellant failed to establish his case on balance of probabilities;iii.disregarding the evidence given by the appellant and solely relying on the respondent’s evidence;iv.dismissing the appellant’s suit; andv.awarding costs to the respondents.d.the applicants’ draft memorandum of appeal demonstrates that the applicant has an arguable appeal with a high probability of success against the finding and decision of theELC;e.the respondent has commenced demolition of structures on the suit property and if the demolition continues and is concluded before the intended appeal is heard and determined, the same will have been rendered nugatory;f.unless this Court urgently intervenes, the applicant is reasonably apprehensive that the respondents may at any time dispose of the suit properties which will cause the applicant to suffer irrevocable losses;g.in the absence of the injunction to protect the subject matter of the appeal, the suit properties, the appeal will be merely academic and will be rendered nugatory as damages cannot compensate the demolition of the structures on the suit property;h.the respondents will not suffer prejudice if an order of temporary injunction is granted pending hearing and determination of the intended appeal; andi.the interest of justice demands that the suit property be preserved by an order of injunction pending appeal.3.The motion is supported by the affidavit sworn by the applicant giving background information regarding the suit to the effect that: the applicant was the registered owner of the suit  properties until the respondents fraudulently transferred the same. That he secured a loan of Kshs. 20,000,000 from the 2ndrespondent and charged the suit properties as collateral hence surrendering the title documents to the 2ndrespondent. That he later entered an agreement with the 1strespondent for the sale of the suit properties but the 1strespondent failed to perform its part of the bargain which fact resulted to frustration of the contract as the 1strespondent failed to pay Kshs. 18,500,000 on the agreed date. That both the 1stand 2ndrespondents were informed that the contract between the parties had been frustrated. That the 1strespondent in collusion with the 2ndand 3rdrespondents fraudulently transferred the suit properties to itself and secured a loan of Kshs. 10,000,000 from the 2ndrespondent and charged the suit properties  as security. The applicant further  deponed that the 2ndrespondent did not inform the applicant of this  development and the applicant learnt of the change of ownership of the suit properties when he conducted a search at the Lands Registry.4.The applicant further deponed that he neither consented nor issued any documents to the 1strespondent to aid the transfer. That he visited the suit properties and found a group of men demolishing the developments thereon under the instruction of the 1strespondent. That his efforts to stop the demolition were futile as the group of men threatened to harm him and on reporting to the police, he did not get any assistance. The applicant further deponed that in the circumstances, he resorted to seeking the injunction orders as the only remedy to save the suit properties from the said destruction. The applicant further deponed that he is apprehensive that the 1strespondent may dispose of the suit properties thereby causing him irrecoverable loss.5.The motion was opposed vide a replying affidavit sworn by Ciliaka Karimi, a director of the 1strespondent who deponed, inter alia, that the application is incompetent, bad in law and an abuse of the court process; that the applicant has not approached the Court with clean hands as the applicant filed a similar application dated 5thSeptember, 2017 before theELCseeking an injunction pending the hearing and determination of the suit where an interim order of injunction was granted. That the 1strespondent filed an application seeking to review and set aside the interim order of injunction.That on 8thNovember, 2019 theELCdismissed the applicant’s application for injunction with costs while the 1strespondent’s application for  review was allowed with costs. The 1strespondent deponed that the applicant did not appeal against the said ruling.Submissions by Counsel6.When the application came up for hearing before us, Messrs Achach & Associates Advocates LLP appeared for the applicant while Messrs Magee Law LLP appeared for the 1strespondent. The 2ndand  3rdrespondents did not participate in the hearing of the application. Counsel for both the applicant and the 1strespondent filed submissions and sought to rely on them.7.Counsel for the applicants relied on the case ofGiella v Cassman Brown & Co Ltd[1973]EA358 that for an interlocutory injunction to be granted the applicant has to establish aprima faciecase and whether he stands to suffer irreparable damage if the injunction is denied. Counsel submitted that where in doubt the Court ought to decide the issue on a balance of convenience. Counsel submitted that the applicant and the 1strespondent entered into a sale agreement, which expressly indicated that time, was of the essence. Counsel asserted that the 1strespondent blatantly disregarded the said agreement and fraudulently transferred the suit properties to itself without the applicant’s consent. Counsel asserted that the respondents infringed the applicant’s proprietary rights when they colluded to fraudulently transfer the suit properties to the 1strespondent.8.Counsel further submitted that the applicant visited the suit properties and found a group of men demolishing property on the suit properties.Counsel asserted that unless an order of injunction is granted, the demolition on the suit properties will continue and may be concluded before the appeal is heard. Counsel emphasized that this will cause extensive loss to the applicant that cannot be remedied by an award of damages. Counsel concluded by submitting that the balance of convenience tilts in favour of granting the orders sought.9.Counsel for the 1strespondent submitted that the applicant’s application is res judicata as a similar application was filed before the trial court and was determined in favour of the 1strespondent. Counsel further submitted that the applicant has not met the threshold for the grant of an order of injunction under Rule 5(2)(b) of thisCourt’s Rules. On arguability, counsel contended that there is no appeal as the applicant failed to file a record of appeal within 60 days and did not serve counsel for the respondents with the notice of appeal as required under Rules 79 and 84 of thisCourt’s Rules. Counsel asserted that the applicant has no arguable appeal as the memorandum of appeal raises new issues pertaining to a breach of contract, which issues were not pleaded in the plaint and were not up for determination by theELC. Counsel further asserted that the applicant did not plead particulars of breach of contract and did not seek  remedies for breach of contract. Counsel emphasized that a party should not be allowed to travel beyond its pleadings. Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decision ofOlive Mugenda v Wilfred Itolondo & 11 others[2016]eKLRin support of this proposition.10.On the nugatory aspect, counsel, submitted that the applicant has not demonstrated that he is in possession of the suit properties. In counsel’s opinion, the orders of injunction are aimed at evicting the 1strespondent from the suit properties without affording the 1strespondent a fair hearing. Counsel asserted that the applicant’s alleged loss can be compensated by an award of damages. Counsel submitted that the 1strespondent is in possession of the suit properties and if an order of injunction is granted, it will cause great prejudice to the 1strespondent. In conclusion, counsel urged this Court to dismiss the application on the ground that it is incompetent, as the applicant has not met the requirements for the grant of an order of injunction.Determination11.We have considered the application; the grounds in support thereof, the authorities cited and the law. The jurisdiction under Rule 5(2)(b) of thisRulesis discretionary and guided by the interests of justice.12.The principles for granting a stay of execution, injunction or stay of proceedings under Rule 5(2)(b) of thisCourt’s Rulesare well settled. This Court in the case ofTrust Bank Limited and Another v. Investech Bank Limited & 3 Others[2000]eKLRdelineated the jurisdiction of this Court in such an application as follows:“The jurisdiction of the Court under Rule 5(2)(b) is original and discretionary and it is trite law that to succeed an applicant has to show firstly that his appeal or intended appeal is arguable, to put another way, it is not frivolous and secondly that unless he is granted a stay the appeal or intended appeal, if successful will be rendered nugatory. These are the guiding principles but these principles must be considered against facts and circumstances of each case…”13.On the first principle, as to whether or not the appeal is arguable, we have to consider whether there is at least a single bona fide arguable ground that has been raised by the applicants in order to warrant ventilation before this Court. See:Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui v Tony Ketter & 5 Others[2013]eKLRwhere this Court described an arguable appeal in the following terms:“vii)An arguable appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court; one which is not frivolous.viii)In considering an application brought under Rule 5 (2(b) the court must not make definitive or final findings of either fact or law at that stage as doing so may embarrass the ultimate hearing of the main appeal.”14.We have considered the grounds set out in the motion and the draft memorandum of appeal. In our view, it is arguable inter alia: whether theELCerred in law and in fact in failing to give meaning to or properly interpret the clause “time is of the essence” in the agreement for sale. An arguable appeal is not necessarily one that must succeed, but merely one that is deserving of consideration by the Court. Without saying more lest we embarrass the bench that will be seized of the main appeal, we are satisfied that the intended appeal is arguable.15.On the nugatory aspect, the position in law is that this depends on whether or not what is sought to be stayed if allowed to happen is irreversible; or if it is not reversible, whether damages will reasonably compensate the aggrieved party. See:Reliance Bank Ltd V Norlake Investments Ltd(2002) 1EA227.16.We have considered the above threshold in light of the applicant’s position on the prerequisites. From the circumstances of this case the applicant entered into a sale agreement to sell the suit properties to the 1strespondent for the sum of Kshs. 18,500,000. Part of this purchase consideration was intended to settle the debt that the applicant owed to the 2ndrespondent. It is not in dispute that the 1strespondent settled this debt on behalf of the applicant. The value of the suit properties is therefore known. The 1strespondent is in possession. The balance of convenience tilts  in  favour  of  the  1strespondent.  In  the  circumstances,  we  are persuaded that an award of damages would adequately compensate the applicant in the event that the intended appeal succeeds.17.This Court in the case ofEsso Kenya Limited v Mark Makwata Okiya[1992]eKLRstated as follows:“…as it is settled law that where the remedy sought can be compensated by an award of damages then the equitable relief of injunction is not available.”18.Accordingly, we find that the appeal, if successful, will not be rendered nugatory, if the orders sought are not granted. In the circumstances, the applicant has failed to satisfy the 2ndlimb of the requirements of Rule 5(2)(b) of thisCourt’s Rules.19.It is well settled that for an application under Rule 5(2)(b) of thisCourt’s Rulesto succeed, the applicant must satisfy both limbs of the twin principles. (See:Republic v Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission & 2 others(2009) KLR 31, and Reliance Bank Ltd v Norlake Investments Limited (supra).20.In the circumstances, we find that the applicant has failed to satisfy one limb of the requirements under Rule 5(2)(b) of thisCourt’s Rules. The upshot is that the notice of motion dated 5thJuly 2023 is dismissed with costs to the 1strespondent. It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.W.

      [2015] KEHAT 7 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the HIV and AIDS TribunalFamilyTribunal Case 066 of 2014JO Arwa, Chair, A Siparo, Vice Chair, M Deche, MN Kullow, S Bosire, J Muriuki & J Kyambi, MembersDecember 18, 2015BetweenJMClaimantandHMRespondentJudgmentConstitutional Law - fundamental rights and freedoms – discrimination -whether the respondent’s acts and behavior amounted to discrimination against the claimant based on her HIV status – whether there was breach of confidentiality from the unlawful disclosure of the claimant’s HIV status by the respondent –whether the claim was merited.Jurisdiction - jurisdiction of the HIV and AIDS Tribunal - whether the tribunal could infer jurisdiction to determine matters of discrimination within the home or family setting – whether theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Acthad comprehensively dealt with all forms of discrimination -HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act, 2006, section 3;HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control ActPart VIII.Words and phrases:1.Discrimination has commonly been defined as “a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group, not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits and advantages available to other members of the society.” (Andrews vs Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 SCR 143).Brief Facts:2.The claimant and the respondent had been married for the last 12 years. In 2010, the claimant tested HIV positive and on informing the respondent of her status, the respondent was at first supportive but later on changed and allegedly started discriminating against her based on HIV status by, inter alia, refusing to talk to the claimant, refusing to eat together with the claimant or share utensils with her and moving out of their matrimonial home without the claimant’s knowledge. Thus the claimant sought for a declaration that the actions of the respondent were unlawful, unfair and prejudicial to the claimant. The claimant also sought exemplary damages and costs of the suit. Conversely, the respondent denied discriminating against the claimant based on her HIV status.3.He contended that the claimant was cruel and disrespectful to him and listed particulars of cruelty, inter alia, that due to the respondent’s work engagement he would travel for weeks and after long safaris the claimant was not there to welcome him and that whenever the claimant took her leave from work, she would disappear and never inform the respondent of her whereabouts and whenever the respondent enquired he was told that she was an adult.4.The Tribunal ordered the parties to file their submissions and fixed the matter for mention for purposes of highlighting the submissions. On the mention date, there was no appearance by the respondent or his Counsel, neither were there submissions on record. The Tribunal fixed mention dates on three more occasions for the respondent to file his submission but he did not comply accordingly.5.The main issues for determination by the tribunal were:i.Whether the respondent’s acts and behavior amounted to discrimination against the claimant based on her HIV status;ii.Whether there was breach of confidentiality from the unlawful disclosure of the claimant’s HIV status by the respondent;iii.What damages, if any, were payable to the claimant in the circumstances and what was the appropriate order as to costs?6.Held:1.Part VIII of theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act, 2006 dealt with the issue of discrimination, specifically addressing discrimination at the workplace, schools, with regard to travel and habitation, in public service, in respect of access to credit and insurance services, in health institutions, and with regard to burial. It did not mention discrimination within the home or in the marriage setting, which was the gist of the instant claim. However, section 3 of theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Actinferred the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to deal with discrimination within the home by outlawing discrimination in all its forms and subtleties against persons with or persons perceived or suspected of having HIV and AIDS.2.The Tribunal took judicial notice of the fact that a lot of abuse, especially gender based abuse took place within the home. Some of the gender based violence was HIV related. With prevalence of discrimination within the home, people did not feel safe enough to get tested and know their HIV status and be at liberty to disclose the same, which impacted negatively on the fight against the spread of HIV. It was therefore useful for Parliament to specifically expand the areas in Part VIII of theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Actto include the home and family setting.3.Regarding the respondent’s conduct towards the claimant, the alleged mistreatment of the claimant did not start immediately upon learning of her HIV status. If the respondent’s reason for changing his behavior towards the claimant had anything to do with the claimant’s HIV status, then the reaction would have been immediate rather than delayed. The basis of the behavior and attitude between the claimant and the respondent was a series of long standing and deep seated matrimonial issues unrelated to her HIV status. Such matters would be best addressed in a matrimonial cause rather than in the instant forum. Thus, the respondent had not discriminated against the claimant on the basis of her HIV status.4.The above holding notwithstanding, that did not mean that the maltreatment of family members by spouses and extended family was not probable. Such existed and took the form of desertion, denial of conjugal rights, and economic sabotage especially where there was discordance. Where there was sufficient evidence of its occurrence, the Tribunal would not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction to remedy such a wrong.5.Under section 22(1)(a) of theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act, one of the objects of the Act was to extend to every person suspected or known to be infected with HIV and AIDS full protection of their human rights and civil liberties by guaranteeing the right to privacy of the individual. Unlawful disclosure of one’s HIV status violated the right to privacy as it opened doors to invasion of one’s autonomy of their personal space. The respondent’s discussion and subsequent disclosure of the claimant’s HIV status with his brother was uncalled for and unlawful. Just like discrimination, breach of confidentiality through unlawful disclosure created stigma which had a negative impact on the fight against HIV and AIDS.6.Although the claimant did not include an indication on the amount of damages claimed, the Tribunal considered past awards by the Tribunal (B. O v Meridian Equator Hospital, Claim No 005 of 2013) and awarded the claimant a sum of Kshs.150,000/= for unlawful disclosure.7.Claimant awarded Kshs. 150,000/= for unlawful disclosure and costs of the suit.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 18THDAY OF DECEMBER, 2015.……………………………J.

Nzili J.), on 12thJuly 2023 and has filed a notice of appeal dated 24thJuly 2023 against the impugned judgment and prays to be heard by this Court;ii.That the respondent has, after delivery of the judgment, embarked on execution by depositing construction materials on the suit land and is in the process of beginning construction on the suit land;iii.That the applicant has legal title and proprietary rights to the suit land. That unless this application for stay of execution of the judgment of the ELC is heard as a matter of urgency, the applicant is at risk of losing the suit land to the respondent. That this will render the appeal nugatory and at all times occasioning irreparable loss and damage to the applicant;iv.That the applicant will suffer substantial loss if the respondent proceeds to execute and register the suit land in his name;v.That the applicant has an arguable appeal with great chances of success on the grounds inter alia that the ELC misapplied the settled principles of law and more particularly the principle of adverse possession and the respondent will not suffer any loss if the orders sought are issued; andvi.That the applicant has filed the instant application without unreasonable delay and undertakes to expeditiously prosecute the intended appeal.1.The motion is supported by an affidavit sworn by the applicant rehashingthe grounds on the face of the application and stating further that  therespondent was granted the suit land by way of adverse possession. Thatthe applicant was ordered to sign the transfer documents in favour of therespondent failing which the Deputy Registrar of the Court to execute thesame. That the applicant has an arguable appeal as per the draft memorandum of appeal.4.The motion was opposed vide a replying affidavit sworn by the respondentwho deponed inter alia that the appeal cannot be rendered nugatory as theapplicant has never lived on the suit land. That the applicant is not inoccupation and will therefore not suffer any prejudice. Further, that thereis no reason advanced for the grant of the orders of stay of execution.Further, that the instant application before this Court is not merited and the same ought to be dismissed with costs.5.A brief background will help place the application in context. The respondent filed a suit by way of originating summons dated 11thDecember 2017 seeking an order that he is entitled to the suit landregistered in the name of the applicant by virtue of adverse possession. It was the respondent’s case that his mother, Anita Karambu M’Murunga (deceased) was the 2ndwife of the late Ayub M’Muga M’itaro who gifted her the suit land in the year 1950 which she continued to occupy with her 6 children and that the respondent has lived on the suit land since birth.6.On the other hand, the applicant opposed the claim on grounds inter alia that he become the registered owner of the suit land in 1994 through MeruH.C Succession Cause No. 177 of 1992 upon inheriting the suit landfrom his father and grandfather and that the respondent and his  mother(Anita Karambu M’Murunga) who is now deceased lived on a separate pieceof land L.R No. Abothuguchi/Ruiga/33. That the respondent’s motherforcefully entered the suit land after the applicant’s registration and erected a timber house and lived therein.7.The ELC found as follows:“In my view, therefore, entry into the land was not out of any permission or license by the initial owner and the successor to the title. Similarly, the plaintiff drove out and discontinued possession of the suit land’s initial and subsequent owners. The evidence tendered by the plaintiff manifests the right to possess and occupy to the exclusion of the true owner’s right to use the land for the purpose he intended in law. I find the ingredients of adverse possession proved to the required standards and declare the plaintiff entitled to the suit land by virtue of adverse possession. The defendant shall sign transfer forms in favor of the plaintiff within two months from the date hereof in default, of which the Deputy Registrar of this court shall execute them. Costs to the plaintiff.”It is this finding that provoked the filing of a notice of appeal and the instant applicationSubmissions by Counsel8.When the application came up for hearing Messrs Mutuma Gichuru & Associates Advocates appeared for the applicant while Messrs Mogeni & Co Advocates represented the respondent. Both counsel filed written submissions, which they relied on.9.Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant stands to suffer substantial loss if the order of stay of the impugned judgment is notgranted as the respondent has deposited construction materials on thesuit land and has embarked on the process of construction of permanent structures on the suit land. That this act will prove prejudicial to the applicant if an order of stay is not granted. Counsel further submitted that the respondent may dispose of the suit land to 3rdparties. Counsel relied on the decisions of this Court case in Malcom Bell vs Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi & Another [2006] eKLR and RWW vs EKW [2019] eKLR in support of the proposition that “the purpose of stay pending appeal is to preserve the subject matter in dispute …”.10.On the question whether the appeal is arguable, counsel submitted that the claim for adverse possession was not proved as the respondent admitted the existence of several court cases filed between the parties hence breaking the continuous occupation of the 12-year period. Counsel further submitted that the respondent’s possession and occupation of the suit land was by force and was constantly interrupted by the applicant through the court cases hence the appeal has high chances of success. The applicant relied on this Court’s decision of Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui v Tony Ketter & 5 Others [2013] eKLR that:“a single arguable issue is sufficient to determine that the applicant has an arguable appeal.”11.Counsel for the respondent submitted that the issue before the trial Court was one of adverse possession and not ownership and the respondent has been in occupation of the suit land. Counsel contended that as such, there is nothing to stay. Counsel asserted that the balance of convenience  tilts in  favour  of  declining  to  grant  the  orders  sought.  Counsel  further submitted that the record of appeal has been filed and the applicant ought to urge the Court to list the appeal for hearing. Counsel conceded that the appeal is arguable but has no chances of success as all the ingredients for adverse possession were proved. Counsel emphasized that the construction materials were on the suit land even before the delivery of the impugned judgment. Further, that the respondent resides on the suit land with his family and therefore he cannot dispose of the suit land as feared by the applicant. Counsel asserted that in the circumstances, there is no danger of disposing of the suit land to warrant grant of injunctive orders.In conclusion, counsel submitted that the conditions for grant of an order of stay and injunction have not been proved. Counsel urged this Court to dismiss the application with costs.Determination12.We have considered the application, the grounds in support thereof, the authorities cited and the law. The jurisdiction under Rule 5(2)(b) of this Court’s Rules is discretionary and guided by the interests of justice.13.The principles for granting a stay of execution, injunction or stay of proceedings under Rule 5(2)(b) of this Court’s Rules are well settled. This Court in the case of Trust Bank Limited and Another v. Investech Bank Limited & 3 Others [2000] eKLR delineated the jurisdiction of this Court in such an application as follows:“The jurisdiction of the Court under Rule 5(2)(b) is original and discretionary and it is trite law that to succeed an applicant has to show firstly that his appeal or intended appeal is arguable, to put another way, it is not frivolous and secondly that unless he is granted a stay the appeal or intended appeal, if successful will be rendered nugatory. These are the guiding principles but these principles must be considered against facts and circumstances of each case…”14.On the first principle, as to whether or not the appeal is arguable, we have to consider whether there is at least a single bona fide arguable ground that has been raised by the applicants in order to warrant ventilation before this Court. See: Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui v Tony Ketter & 5 Others (supra) where this Court described an arguable appeal in the following terms:vii)An arguable appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court; one which is not frivolous.viii)In considering an application brought under Rule 5 (2) (b) the court must not make definitive or final findings of either fact or law at that stage as doing so may embarrass the ultimate hearing of the main appeal.”15.We have carefully considered the grounds set out in the motion and the draft memorandum of appeal. In its written submissions, the respondent has conceded that the appeal is arguable. Our consideration of  the grounds of appeal set out in the draft memorandum of appeal leads us to likewise conclude that, the appeal is arguable. An arguable appeal is  not necessarily one that must succeed, but merely one that is deserving of consideration by the Court.16.On the nugatory aspect, which is whether the appeal, should it succeed,would be rendered nugatory if we decline to grant the orders sought and the intended appeal succeeds, in Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui v Tony Ketter & 5 Others (supra) this Court stated that:“ix).The term “nugatory” has to be given its full meaning. It does not only mean worthless, futile or invalid. It also means trifling.x).Whether or not an appeal will be rendered nugatory depends on whether or not what is sought to be stayed if allowed to happen is reversible; or if it is not reversible whether damages will reasonably compensate the party aggrieved”.17.In determining whether or not an appeal will be rendered nugatory, the Court has to consider the conflicting claims of both parties and each case has to be determined on its merits. In the instant application,  the applicant’s main contention is that the respondent has deposited construction material on the suit land and permanent structures may be constructed thereon. Further, that the suit land may be disposed of to third parties. On the other hand, the respondent maintained that he has been using the suit land as his residential home where he lives with his family and has no intention of selling it. The respondent further maintained that the applicant has never lived on the suit property and will therefore  suffer  no  prejudice  if  the  orders  sought  are  not  granted. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the suit land is in imminent danger of disposal as claimed by the applicant. Further, the applicant has not shown that he is living on the suit land and risks eviction if the orders sought are not granted. In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that the appeal will be rendered nugatory if we decline to grant the orders sought are not granted.18.It is well settled that for an application under Rule 5(2)(b) of this Court’s Rules to succeed, the applicant must satisfy both limbs of the twin principles. (See: Republic v Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission & 2 others (2009) KLR 31, and Reliance Bank Ltd v Norlake Investments Limited (2012) 1 EA 227).19.In the circumstances, we find that the applicant has failed to satisfy both limbs of the requirements under Rule 5(2)(b) of this Court’s Rules. The upshot is that the notice of motion dated 1stAugust, 2023 is dismissed with costs to the respondent. It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.JAMILA MOHAMMED……………………..….….JUDGE OF APPEALL. KIMARU……….…………....…….JUDGE OF APPEALA. O.

The Applicant/Tenant has also sought the costs of the Application.The Tenant’s depositions2.The Tenant’s affidavit in support of her Application may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Tribunal’s ruling delivered on 11.4.2024 gave the Tenant seven (7) days to pay the filing fees but unbeknown to the court, the amount had been paid, albeit by the Landlord/Respondent on 10.11.2021 erroneously.b.That on 2.4.2024, the Tenant sent Kshsl 98,000/= to the Counsel for the Landlord to reimburse what the Landlord had paid as the Tenant could not pay the filing fees on the Judiciary platform.c.That the money sent to Counsel for the Landlord was not rent but filing fees.d.That the Reference was properly filed as at the time the Ruling was delivered on 11.4.2024 and the Tenant is therefore greatly prejudiced by the Ruling of the court.e.That in the circumstances, the Tenant’s Reference ought to be reinstated for hearing.3.In opposing the Application, the Landlord has filed amended grounds of opposition as follows;-a.That the Application is fatally defective and an abuse of the court process.b.That the Application is res judicarta, the court having heard and determined the preliminary objection dated 1.5.2024.c.The Applicant has not met the conditions necessary for the grant of orders for review envisioned by order 45 of Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.Analysis and determination4.The only issue that arises for determination in this Application is whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders of review she has sought in her Application.5.The Ruling that the Tenant seeks to have set aside is the one dated 11.4.2024. The Tenant’s argument is that she had paid the requisite filing fees by way of a refund to Counsel for the Landlord on 2.4.2024 before the court delivered its ruling. In order to understand how the court arrived at the ruling, it is important to go back on the court record as I now do.a.On 21.3.2023, Counsel for the Landlord informed the court that there was no competent reference before the court. Counsel stated that the Landlord erroneously paid the assessed fees of Kshs. 93,583/= and on 11.5.2022, Counsel for the Landlord wrote to Counsel for the Tenant requesting for a refund of the fees erroneously paid. Counsel pressed on that the Tenant needed to demonstrate that he had actually paid the filing fees, failing which the said Counsel urged the court to find that there was no compliance with Section 6 of the Act.b.On the same day and during the same proceedings, Counsel for the Tenant admitted that his client had not paid the filing fees but undertook to pay the same.c.The court on the same day, made the following orders;-“The Counsel for the Tenant confirms that the Tenant did not pay for the reference but requests for some time to make the necessary payments. I will make a ruling in this matter on whether or not there is a competent reference before the court on 3.4.2024.”d.On 3.4.2024, Counsel for the Tenant did not attend court but Counsel for the Landlord attended court. The directions/ruling in the matter was pushed to 10.4.2024. No mention of any payments was made by Counsel for the Landlorde.Eventually on 11.4.2024, the court made the following directions;-i.That the Tenant will pay the assessed court fees for her reference within the next seven days failing which the reference will stand struck out and the Landlord’s notice dated 5.8.2021 will stand approved in its entirety.ii.That the Tribunal will refund the fees paid by the Landlord on account of the assessment for the Tenant’s reference dated 18.10.2021.iii.That the matter be mentioned on 19.4.2024 for further directions.6.From the above ruling, the Tenant was granted seven days to pay the filing fees to the Tribunal. If indeed she tried to pay the fees and she encountered difficulties, I have seen no evidence of such difficulty as it does not seem to have been brought to the attention of the Tribunal.7.If on the other hand the Tenant had indeed paid the filing fees to the Landlord’s Counsel as deponed in her affidavit, then the best time to have brought this to the attention of the Tribunal was within the seven days granted by the Tribunal and before which the notice by the Landlord would become effective.The failure by the Tenant to take any action within the seven days window offered by the court effectively meant that the court orders of 11.4.2024 became self-executing.8.The Tenant only filed her Application on 23.4.2024 being after the timelines set out in the Ruling of 11.4.2024 had lapsed. The information that the Tenant had paid any money to Counsel for the Landlord ought to have been brought to the attention of the court anytime within the seven days granted by the court. In my view therefore, the Tenant came to court when the horse had already bolted.9.It may also help to note that the Tribunal was determining the competency of the reference filed by the Tenant as at 21.3.2024 and not as at 2.4.2024 when the Tenant says she refunded the filing fees to the Landlord’s Counsel.10.I am not therefore convinced that there has been a discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the Tenant, or could not be produced by her at the time the order was made. I am further not convinced and nor has the Applicant alleged that there was an error or mistake on the face of the record. (see order 45 Rule 1(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules).11.Consequently, I do not find any merits in the Tenant’s Application dated 23.4.2024 and the same is dismissed with costs to the Landlord.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 14THDAY OF AUGUST,2024.HON.

The Applicant has also sought for police assistance in the enforcement of the orders sought through the OCS, Kasarani police station and costs.The Tenant’s depositions2.The Affidavit of the Tenant in support of this Application sworn on 5.7.2024 may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Applicant is a tenant in the suit premises paying a monthly rent of Kshs. 7,000/=.b.That on 1.7.2024, the Respondent made a verbal demand to the Tenant requiring the Tenant to vacate the premises.c.That while the Tenant has no problem continuing with the payment of rent, the Respondent has started interfering with the quiet use and occupation of the premises by unjustifiably harassing the Tenant.d.That the actions of the Respondent are meant to ensure that the Tenant does not file a reference to the Tribunal under Section 6(1) of Cap 301.The Landlord’s response3.The Landlord’s affidavit has been sworn by Kevma Real Estate may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Applicant is a Tenant of the rental space A-2 at Camp Entumoto in Kasarani by virtue of the tenancy agreement dated 29.7.2022 and the Tenant has been paying rent irregularly and only upon demand.b.That the Applicant has rent arrears amounting to Kshs. 16,000/= as at 5.7.2024.c.That on 4.7.2024, the Respondent informed the Tenant of the rent arrears and advised the Tenant to vacate the premises on account of the arrears.d.That the Respondent further confiscated the Tenant’s meat grill on 4.7.2024 pending the payment of the arrears.e.That on 10.7.2024, the Respondent was served with this court’s order requiring him to return the grill and to desist from disturbing the Tenant and even after complying with the said order, the Tenant continued to be in arrears of rent.f.That the Tenant’s Application ought to be dismissed and the Tenant ordered to vacate the premises.Analysis and determination4.The only issue that arises for determination is whether the Tenant in entitled to the orders sought in his Application.5.The Tenant’s Complaint is that the Landlord/Respondent is interfering with the Tenant’s quiet enjoyment and peaceful possession of the suit premises. The Tenant has deponed in his affidavit that the Respondent issued a verbal notice requiring the Tenant to vacate the premises. The Respondent in its replying affidavit has admitted that it issued a verbal notice requiring the Tenant to vacate the suit premises on account of non-payment of rent and went on to confiscate the Tenant’s meat grill which it only returned to the Tenant after the Tenant obtained court orders.6.The Respondent’s verbal notice to terminate the tenancy between the parties clearly offends the provisions of Section 4(1) and 4(2) of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya and is obviously illegal and of no consequence.7.Whereas the Respondent is entitled to levy distress for rent for any rent arrears, the Respondent’s confiscation of the Tenant’s meat grill did not appear to follow any recognized procedure laid down for the levy of distress for rent. It was illegal.8.The Tenant has not denied that he is in rent arrears but I also do note that the Respondent has not proved the indebtedness of the Tenant and more specifically because the Respondent is required under Section 3(3) of Cap 301 to keep a rent book in the prescribed form. It would have been expected in the circumstances that the Respondent would have exhibited a copy of the rent records which unfortunately it has not.9.In the circumstances, I do find merits in the Tenant’s Application and proceed to allow the same as prayed and more particularly issue orders in terms of prayers 3, 4 and 5 thereof.10.The Tenant’s Complaint dated 5.7.2024 raises the same issues as the Tenant’s Application of even date and the issues having been inclusively determined in this Ruling, I proceed to allow the Complaint in the terms set out under paragraph9above.11.The Tenant will have the costs of the Application and the Complaint.

      [2024] KECA 1129 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Court of Appeal at NyeriCriminal Appeal 196 of 2017W Karanja, J Mohammed & AO Muchelule, JJASeptember 6, 2024BetweenHarrison Muthie KariukiAppellantandRepublicRespondent((Being an Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the High Court of Kenya at Meru (R.K. Limo, J.) dated 13th October 2015 in HCCR No. 9 of 2012))Judgment1.The appellant, Harrison Muthie Kariuki, is before us challenging his conviction and sentence for the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The particulars were that on 6thJuly 2012 at Komboini Village in Kirinyaga District within Kirinyaga County, he murdered Moses Karaba Kibutha (the deceased). He was convicted on 13thOctober 2015 by the learned R.K. Limo, J. of the High Court at Kerugoya, and sentenced to death.2.The conviction and sentence have been challenged on the following grounds:-“1)That the trial Judge erred in law while convicting me on inconsistent and contradicted evidence by the key prosecution witnesses.2.That the trial Judges erred in law while convicting me on the basis of identification by the identifying witnesses which the same wasn’t made under free atmospheric conditions.3.That the trial Judges erred in law while convicting me on charges that weren’t proved to point to my link to the execution of the same.4.That the trial Judges erred in law while complying with the provisions of section 169(1) of the C.P.C. Cap 75 L.O.K.”3.The appellant filed the following supplementary grounds of appeal:-“1)That the learned trial Judge erred in law in finding that the charge of murder contrary to section 203 as read with section 204 of the Penal Code had been proved to the required standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.2.That the learned trial Judge of the superior court erred in law in finding that the conditions obtained during the commission of the offence were conducive/favourable for positive identification/recognition of the appellant.3.That the trial court erred in law in convicting the appellant on evidence which was discredited and unreliable for having contradictions, discrepancies, and inconsistencies.4.That the trial court erred in law by failing to fully comply with the mandatory provision of section 201(2) of the CPC Cap 75 Laws of Kenya.5.That the learned trial Judge erred in law in considering extraneous evidence on the defence of drunkenness which was raised only as or in submissions. The same occasioned prejudice/injustice for submissions do not amount to evidence.6.That the superior court erred both in law in shifting the burden of proof apropos of the defence of alibi raised by the appellant.7.That the learned trial Judge erred in law in meting out mandatory death sentence.”4.The record shows that the prosecution called ten (10) witnesses. Millicent Wairimu Karaba (PW 1) was the deceased’s widow. When she testified, she was 64 years old. The appellant was her grandson; son to her son. On 6thJuly 2012 she was in the kitchen preparing supper (ugali) for the deceased who was under a mango tree in the compound warming himself. She sent her granddaughter Christine Wairimu Wamweru (PW 2), aged 15, to take warm water to the deceased to wash his hands in readiness for the food. It was about 8.30 pm. Behind PW 2 was Arnold Macharia Peris (PW 3), a class eight child, who was carrying food. He was also the appellant’s cousin. The appellant appeared from the path leading to the toilet and confronted the deceased asking him “How many courts have you gone to?” The deceased responded, “Why?” The appellant called him “uncircumcised” and stated “I have come to kill you.” This voice attracted PW 1 to the scene. The appellant kicked the deceased on the chest. The deceased fell down. The appellant took a wooden chair and used it to hit the deceased until it broke into pieces. PW 1 was screaming. When PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 tried to get close to where the deceased was being beaten the appellant threated to kill them. With the chair in pieces and the deceased on the ground, PW 1 ran to call the Assistant Chief. The appellant had run away. In the meantime, the appellant’s father, David Kariuki Karaba (PW 4), who had left home to go and buy cigarettes, returned when he heard screams. He found his father (the deceased) on the ground while badly injured. Many people had come to the scene. He was told that the deceased had been injured by the appellant who had run away. PW 4 organised for a vehicle to take the deceased to Kerugoya District Hospital. The deceased died on the way to hospital. The incident was reported at Kerugoya Police Station and at Sagana Police Station. The appellant was arrested the same night at his house.5.When Dr. Karomo Ndirangu (PW 9) conducted post mortem on the body of the deceased on 13thMay 2012 at Kerugoya District Hospital, he found that the body was bruised on the forehead and on the lower ribs on the right side. He had broken ribs on the lower right side; ribs 8 to 12. The ribs were fractured with hemorrhage. There was rapture of liver posteriority. The cause of death was intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to blunt trauma.6.The appellant gave a sworn defence in which he denied that he had murdered the deceased who was his grandfather. He stated that the deceased was his great friend and that this did not go down well with the family members. Secondly, his father (PW 4) would complain that he (the appellant) was not his biological son. He denied that he was in the incident that PW 1, PW 2, PW 3 and PW 4 had talked about, in which the deceased was murdered. He stated that after doing his work of harvesting and selling tomatoes on this day, he went to drink in a bar until 6.30pm. He changed to another bar where he bought and drunk Napoleon brandy before he walked home with what was left in the bottle. He put the bottle under the bed and slept. He was found asleep in his house by police and arrested. The police took the bottle which they testified about. He did not call witnesses.7.This is the evidence that the trial court considered and found that the guilt of the appellant had been established beyond reasonable doubt. Our duty as the first appellate Court is to subject the whole of the evidence before the trial court to fresh and exhaustive examination and draw our own independent conclusions thereon, while being conscious of the fact that we did not have the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses as they testified. (See Okeno -vs- Republic [1972]EA 32).8.The substance of the appellant’s complaint on appeal was that the deceased was attacked and murdered at night in circumstances that were not favourable for positive identification and/or recognition, and that the prosecution evidence regarding such identification and/or recognition had been contradictory and inconsistent. Therefore, that his conviction was not based on conclusive evidence. The other material complaint was that the trial was by C.W. Githua, J. and subsequently taken over by R.K. Limo, J. who did not explain to him that he was entitled to recall the witnesses who had given evidence before C.W. Githua, J.9.We can deal with this second complaint immediately. During the trial before either Judge, the appellant was represented by learned counsel M. Nduku. R.K. Limo, J. took over the case upon the transfer of C.W. Githua, J. Before R.K. Limo, J. on 27thOctober 2014, the learned counsel addressed the court as follows:-“The matter is part heard. We have no problem with directions given that the matter do proceed from where the other court reached. We only ask for proceedings.”The learned Judge then directed as follows:-“The matter shall proceed from where it had reached. The accused shall be supplied with the copy of the proceedings through his counsel…”It is evident that there was no request that the witnesses who had testified be recalled, a right the appellant had but did not exercise. We do not find any merit in the complaint that the appellant’s right under sections 201(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was compromised. The appellant had the benefit of counsel who understood that the right to recall the witnesses was available but elected not to exercise it.10.On the question of identification, we consider that the appellant was known to the witnesses. The trial court was therefore dealing with recognition. During the hearing of the appeal before us, learned counsel Mr. Makura represented the appellant while learned counsel Mr. Naulikha represented the State. Each had filed written submissions which he was allowed to highlight. It was the submission by Mr. Makura that the incident having been at night, and even as PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 having talked of there having been moonlight, the intensity of the moonlight was not clearly explained. It was pointed out that, according to PW 1 –“It was around 8.00pm. There was moonlight but it was not bright.”When PW 1 was cross-examined, she stated:-“It was around 8.30pm. It was dark.”PW 2 stated that –“That night there was moonlight. I saw the accused very clearly through moonlight assault my grandfather….. our grandfather had sat under a mango tree warming himself using firewood. The mango tree was not far from the kitchen ”According to PW 3, learned counsel submitted:-“There was bright moonlight. I identified the accused as the one who was beating up my father physically through the moonlight. I cannot remember the clothes he was wearing my grandfather had been seated by the fire not far from the kitchen.”11.It was the submission by learned counsel for the appellant that the evidence was not consistent on whether the night was dark or there was moonlight. The situation was made worse by the fact that the attacker caused fear to the witnesses when he threatened to kill them.12.As far as Mr. Naulikha was concerned, the witnesses were closely related to the appellant who they recognized both physically and by voice.13.We are enjoined to carefully reexamine the evidence of PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 to be able to satisfy ourselves that the learned Judge properly engaged with their testimonies before he made the finding that he was satisfied beyond doubt that they positively recognized the appellant as the deceased’s attacker that night. We recall that in Wamunga -vs- Republic [1989] KLR 425, this Court stated as follows:-“It is trite law that where the only evidence against a defendant is evidence of identification or recognition, a trial court is enjoined to examine such evidence carefully and to be satisfied that the circumstances of identification were favourable and free from possibility of error before it can safely make it the basis of a conviction.”14.We are also conscious of the fact that where the prosecution has called several witnesses in support of its case, there are bound to be contradictions and discrepancies or inconsistencies in their evidence. where the contradictions, discrepancies and inconsistencies are material and substantial, they have to be resolved in favour of the accused (See Richard Munene -vs- Republic [2018]eKLR). But where contradictions, discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence do not relate to material facts, or where they are minor, trivial or trifling and not fundamental to the questions in issue or do not create a doubt in the mind of the court, they can be ignored. (See Twegangane Alfred -vs- Uganda [2003] UGCA6).15.In re-evaluating the prosecution evidence, we are alive to the fact that the appellant, in stating that he was not at the scene at the time when PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 stated that he was there and he was the one who attacked and murdered the deceased, he raised the defence of alibi. In dismissing the defence, the trial court stated as follows:-“I also find that the defence of alibi cannot hold as no evidence was adduced to establish it. As a matter of fact, the accused in his written submissions perhaps on reflection abandoned it altogether and put more emphasis on drunkedness……”16.The appellant’s counsel submitted that the trial court misdirected itself when it shifted the burden on the appellant by asking him to adduce evidence to prove the alibi. Then, that the trial had gone on a frolic by attributing the defence of drunkedness on the appellant when he had not raised such a defence. We agree that it was a serious misdirection for the court to demand that the appellant establishes that his alibi was true. This is because it is trite law that an accused who raises an alibi defence does not assume the burden of proving it. (See Kiarie -vs- Republic [1984] KLR 739). In a criminal case, the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond doubt. The burden does not shift. It is the prosecution to call evidence to prove beyond doubt that the accused was at the scene when the offence was committed, and that he was the one who committed it.17.The misdirection notwithstanding, on our re-consideration of the evidence of PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3, we are certain that it was the appellant who attacked and murdered the deceased. The incident was at night, but in the home of the deceased. The deceased was warming himself beside a fire under a mango tree near the kitchen where PW 1 was preparing food. PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 were all closely related to both the appellant and the deceased. There was no reason for all of the witnesses to blame the appellant if she/he did not see him attacking the deceased. According to them, the appellant did not stealthily, as it were, attack the deceased. He did this while talking and threatening to kill the deceased. He warned PW 2 and PW 3 that if they moved near him, he was going to kill them. PW 1 PW 2 and PW 3 certainly could recognize the appellant’s voice, even assuming that this was a dark night. But all testified that there was moonlight. Even if it was not very bright, we find, they could recognize that it was the appellant speaking. These are the reasons why we confirm the finding by the learned Judge that the witnesses were able to positively recognize the appellant as the person who attacked and fatally wounded the deceased on the material night. The evidence was overwhelming.18.The attack on the deceased was not provoked. The appellant came quarrelling. He kicked the deceased in the chest. The deceased fell from the chair he was seated in. He picked the chair and, using it, hit the deceased all over the body until it broke into pieces. As he did this, he was telling the deceased that he was going to kill him. Indeed, the deceased died from the injuries he sustained. He did not reach the hospital. The threats to kill coupled with the vicious attack using a chair until it broke into pieces went to show that the appellant had malice aforethought. He intended to cause the death of the deceased, and went on to actualize it. We confirm the conviction.19.The appellant was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death. This was the mandatory sentence under section 204 of the Penal Code. Learned counsel tried to persuade us that we have discretion to vary the sentence. We agree that following the Supreme Court decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another -vs- R. [2017]eKLR the death sentence, though still lawful is no longer the only sentence available to an accused person following sentence. The Court indeed has discretion to mete out any other sentence depending on the circumstances of each case. Unfortunately, given the nature and the circumstances of the offence herein, it is our view that the appellant deserved the sentence he was given. We decline the invitation to us to interfere with the sentence imposed on the appellant. We uphold the sentence.20.The consequence is that the appeal is dismissed in its entirety.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W.

The Tenant has also sought the assistance of the OCS Menengai police station in the enforcement of the orders sought.Tenant’s depositions2.The Affidavit in support of the Application sworn by the Applicant on 18.4.2024 may be summarized as follows;-a.That on 7.12.2021, the Tenant entered into a lease agreement with one Emma Mary Wanjiru to continue leasing the suit premises on which the Tenant had established a workshop.b.That the Tenant has paid the rent for the entire duration of the lease agreement in the sum of Kshs. 120,000/= upto January, 2024c.That sometimes in March 2024, the Respondent herein served the Tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy.d.That the Tenant has not in any way breached the lease agreement between him and Emma Mary Wanjiku Njuguna.e.That there does exist ….tenancy between the Tenant and the Respondent herein and the Tenant’s Landlord Emma Mary Wanjiku Njuguna has not served the Tenant with any notice to terminate tenancy.The Landlord’s depositions3.The Replying affidavit sworn by the Respondent on 10.7.2024 may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Respondent is registered as a co-owner of the suit premises together with her deceased son, Joseph Muchomba.b.That the Tenant initially entered into a nine (9) year lease for the suit premises (1.1.2011 to 31.12.2020) with the deceased husband of the Respondent at a monthly rent of Kshs. 2,500/= per month.c.That upon the expiry of the lease, the Tenant stopped paying rent and instead filed Tribunal case No. BPRT 14/2021 (Nairobi) which was decided in favour of the Tenant.d.That in the said Ruling, the Tribunal held that he tenancy between the Tenant and the Respondent herein was a controlled tenancy.e.That from the Tenant’s affidavit, the Respondent has since learned that the Tenant has entered into a lease agreement with one Emma Mary Wanjiku while knowing only too well that the said Wanjiku has no property nor legal capacity to enter into any such lease.f.That the said Emma Mary Wanjiku having no legal capacity to enter into any lease over the suit property, the agreement between the Tenant and the said Emma Mary Wanjiku is a nullity in law and has no legal effect whatsoever.g.That the Respondent’s Advocates have served the Tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy which was effective 1.6.2024- and the Tenant has not filed any Reference in opposition to the said notice and the notice has therefore taken effect, and the Tenant is now a trespasser upon the suit premises.Analysis and determination4.The issues that arise for determination in this Application are the following;-a.Whether there exists a Landlord/Tenant relationship between the parties herein and if such tenancy exists, whether it is a controlled tenancy and consequently whether the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this dispute.b.Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application.ssue A: Whether there exists a Landlord/Tenant relationship between the parties herein and if such tenancy exists, whether it is a controlled tenancy and consequently whether the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this dispute.5.The Tenant who has brought this case to court has denied that there exists any Landlord/Tenant relationship between him and the Respondent. The Tenant only recognizes one Ms. Emma Mary Wanjiku Njuguna (hereinafter only referred to as Emma) as his Landlord.If this were to be the end of the matter, I would easily have struck out the Tenant’s cause as the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction where the Tenant sues a party whom he expressly states is not his Landlord. In that event, the Tenant’s suit would have been an abuse of the court process.6.The Tenant has annexed a lease agreement between himself and Ms. Emma. The said lease agreement recognizes the fact that the suit premises is registered in the joint names of one Joseph Muchomba ……. The Respondent herein. The said Ms. Emma is said to be the beneficiary of the Estate of the late Joseph Muchomba. Other than the statements in the lease document, the Tenant has not annexed any letters of administration issued in favour of the said Ms. Emma and neither has the said Emma sworn any affidavit in support of the allegation by the Tenants.7.The Tenant has argued that the Respondent herein had no business issuing him with a notice to terminate tenancy for the reasons that there does not exist any Landlord/Tenant relationship between them. But is this the case?8.The Respondent has deponed in her replying affidavit that the suit land originally belonged to her husband Paul Muchomba (deceased) and is currently registered in the names of her son and herself. I have not seen any evidence of the proprietorship of Ms. Emma over the suit land.9.I have seen the Ruling in Nakuru BPRT Case No. 14A of 2021 which was a suit brought by the Tenant against the Respondent herein. The said Ruling has summarized the Tenant’s case therein as follows;-a.That he (Tenant) entered into a verbal lease agreement with the Landlord/Respondent in 2011 in respect of Plot No. Njoro/Ngata Block 1/4854 New Kiambu.b.That he (Tenant) paid Kshs. 270,000/ running from January 2011 to December 2020 as rent…c.That following the demise of the Landlord Paul Muriu Muchomba, during the term of the tenancy, the Tenant approached the Respondent herein who had been appointed as the legal representative of the Estate of the deceased and he (sic) assured the Tenant that he would stay on as a Tenant in the premises.d.That contrary to the assurance, the Respondent through his (sic) Advocates, served a letter demanding that he vacates the suit premises.e.–f.That the nature of the nature of the lease is a controlled tenancy.10.In the same Ruling, the Respondent admits that indeed a tenancy existed between her late husband and the Tenant.11.The court in its determination of the Application made the following conclusion;-“The tenancy is between the Applicant and the Respondent is a controlled tenancy under the meaning of Section 2 of the Act and the tenancy can only be tampered with under the provisions of Cap 301.”12.The Ruling in the above case clearly declared the tenancy between the parties to be a controlled tenancy. The Tenant in his Affidavit in the said case admits to have been a Tenant of the deceased husband of the Respondent and further admits to have continued staying in the suit premises on account of an undertaking between him and the Respondent.In those circumstances, I do not think it is open to the Tenant to deny that there exists a Landlord/Tenant relationship between him and the Respondent. The notice to terminate tenancy issued by the Respondent therefore seems to fallow from the conclusion by the court ha that the nature of the tenancy between the parties was “controlled tenancy.”I think the notice to terminate tenancy was also issued to deal with the Tenant’s Complaint in case No. BPRT 14A of 2021 that the letter dated 27.11.2020 issued to the Tenant by the Landlord did not constitute a proper notice under Section 4 of Cap 301.13.The Respondent has argued that Ms. Emma wo is said to have entered into a lease agreement with the Tenant had no capacity to enter into the said lease agreement and the said agreement is therefore of no legal consequence. I have noted elsewhere in this Ruling that the said Ms. Emma has not demonstrated her proprietorship of the suit property. Although the Tenant has annexed a lease agreement which describes Ms. Emma as a beneficiary of the Estate of the deceased Joseph Muchomba, there is no evidence that the suit property or a portion thereof has been specifically distributed to the said Ms. Emma. Further, no grant of letters of administration in favour of the said Ms. Emma has been annexed to the Tenant’s affidavit relevant to the Estate of the deceased Joseph Muchomba. In circumstances such as obtain in this case, one would have at the very least expected the said Ms. Emma to file an affidavit in support of the Tenant’s claim and this is not the case in this Application.14.In view of the competing positions as to who between the Respondent and Ms. Emma is the Landlord of the suit premises, it is my finding based on the facts and the Ruling set out in BPRT Case No. 14A of 2021 Nakuru and the undisputed fact that the Respondent herein is registered as one of the proprietors of the suit land, that the Respondent herein is the Landlord of the suit premises.15.It is my further finding that the lease between Ms. Emma and the Tenant cannot bind the Respondent in these circumstances and further I do find that Ms. Emma had no capacity to enter into a lease agreement over the suit premises.Issue B: Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application16.The Tenant’s Complaint is that the Respondent is threatening to evict him illegally while there exists a new lease agreement between the Tenant and Ms. Emma. The Tenant has also complained that the Respondent is attempting to terminate the tenancy by issuing illegal notices. It is on the basis of this Complaint that the Tenant has brought his Application for injunctive relief against the Respondent.17.I have already found that the said Ms. Emma had no capacity to enter into a lease agreement over the suit premises and consequently, the lease agreement exhibited by the Tenant cannot affect the rights of the Respondent over the suit land. In that aspect of the Complaint having been taken care of, the only issue that remains is whether the termination notice issued by the Respondent is an illegal notice as alleged by the Tenant.18.The notice to terminate is the one dated 11.3.2024, effective 1.6.2024. I have perused the same and the same is valid and issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of Cap 301. I do not find any merits in the argument by the Tenant that the said notice is illegal.19.The Tenant has admitted that sometimes in March 2024, he was served with a notice to terminate tenancy and has indeed annexed the notice dated 11.3.2024 to his affidavit in support of the Application. The Tenant was required under the provisions of Section 6(1) of Cap 301, to file a Reference to the Tribunal if he was minded of opposing the notice. This the Tenant did not do as a consequence of which the notice to terminate tenancy became effective from the date indicated therein under the provisions of Section 10 of Cap 301.20.I therefore agree with the submissions by Counsel for the Respondent that the Application dated 18.4.2024 is not a Reference within the meaning of Section 6(1) of Cap 301 and in absence of such reference, the notice to terminate tenancy took effect from 1.6.2024 beyond which the Tenant became a trespasser upon the suit premises.Disposition21.In view of the above findings, I proceed to dispose of this matter by making the following orders;-a.That the Tenant’s Application and Reference dated 18.4.2024 have no merit and are hereby dismissed with costs to the Landlord.b.That the Landlord’s notice to terminate tenancy dated 11.3.2024 is hereby approved subject to the amendment in order (C) hereinabove.c.That the effective date for the notice shall be 31.10.2024.d.That the Tenant shall render vacant possession of the premises on or before 31.10.2024 failing which the Respondent will be at liberty to evict the Tenant using a licensed auctioneer.e.This file is marked as closed.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 26THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.HON.

purposes of the 1stRespondent commercial advertisement on daily newspaper, advertising feature without the consent and authority of the Petitioner.4.He lamented that this prompted him to conduct

of the violation and infringement of the fundamental right to privacy and human dignity of his child, on 17thMarch, 2022, the 1stRespondent posted and or caused to be posted his child’s

petitioner’s consent or authority.6.It was opined that the main motive of using the Petitioner’s child image was to commercially advertise the Respondents which would yield profits in terms of getting more students enrolling for admissions.7.The Petitioner averred that at the time of instituting the petition, and despite having been issued with a demand letter, the respondents are yet to permanently withdraw, pull down, and delete the said Facebook post of his child’s image/photograph on their social media platforms.8.It was his position that the Respondent’s action amount to tantamount violation and infringement of his child’s rights under Article 30, right to privacy and human dignity and additionally his child’s intellectual rights, personality rights were also

damage or loss on part of the Petitioner or the student and that the elements of unlawful use of image has not been established.Petitioner’s Further Affidavit13.The Petitioner by a further affidavit dated 23rdJanuary 2024 deposed that he did not sign the purported admission form particularly consenting to use of his son’s image for the purposes of commercial advertisement and that the purported

commercial purposes using the minor’s image.15.It was further deposed that while the minor was a student at the 2ndrespondent, his image was used to advertise the 1strespondent which is a different branch and even the school uniform was different from what was in the photo indicating that he was made to wear for the advertisement.16.The matter was canvassed by written submissions however the Respondent did not file and serve his written submissions at the time of writing this judgment.SubmissionsThe Petitioner’s Submissions17.Petitioner in his submissions dated 23rdJanuary, 2024 and filed in Court on 31stJanuary, 2024 Counsel for the Respondent raised the following issues for determination:a.Whether the use and publication/advertisement of the petitioner’s child’s image by the respondents for commercial gain without express consent was a violation of the petitioner’s child’s fundamental right to privacy and human dignity.b.Whether the use and publication of the Petitioner’s

as evidencef.Who should bear the cost of the petition.18.On Whether the use and publication/advertisement of the Petitioner’s child’s image by the respondents for commercial gain without express consent was a violation of the petitioner’s child’s fundamental right to privacy and human dignity, the Petitioner relied on article 31 ofthe Constitutionon the right to privacy and the case ofKuria v University of Kabianga (petition E002 of 2022) in addressing the right to privacy.19.Reliance was also placed in the case of Wanjiru v Machakos University Petition E021of 2021 still on the right to privacy being a fundamental human right and the case of Joel Mutuma Kirimi & another vs National Hospital Insurance Fund.20.It was submitted that the petitioner did not give consent to the use of his son’s image for purposes of the 1stRespondent’s commercial advertisement and prayed that the Court finds this as a violation of the petitioner’s child fundamental right to privacy and right to human dignity.21.As to whether the use and publication of the Petitioner’s child’s image by the respondents for commercial gain was a violation of image rights, personality rights and intellectual property rights of the petitioner’s child, reliance was made to the case ofWanjiru vs Machakos University( Petition E021 of 2021) and the case of NWR & another v Green Sports Africa Ltd & 4 others [2017] eKLR on the definition of personality rights,22.On Whether the petitioner is entitled to injunctive orders against the respondents as sought in the petition, it was submitted that having established that the respondents violated the petitioner’s child right to privacy, human dignity, personality rights and thus the petitioner is entitled to permanent injunctive orders against the Respondents.23.Reliance was placed in the case ofWanjiru v Machakos University petition E021 of 2021andKuria vs University of Kabianga Petition E002 of 2022on whether the petitioner has established the conditions.24.Whether the Petitioner is entitled to damages sought, it was submitted that the petitioner had demonstrated that his child’s right to privacy, human dignity, personality rights and intellectual property rights had been violated and thus the respondents should be ordered to compensate the petitioner’s child for damages arising from publication of the Petitioner’s child photograph without express consent or authority.25.Reliance was made to the case of Joel Mutuma & another v National Hospital Insurance Fund[2020] in the guidance of awarding of damages for violation of constitutional rights to dignity and privacy, the case ofWanjiru vs Machakos University Petition E021 of 2021where a nominal damages of Kshs 700,000 was awarded to the Petitioner, the case of Kuria vs KabiangaUniversity Petition E002 of 2022where a sum of Kshs 500,000/- was awarded as general damages and the case of N W R & another v Green sports Africa Ltd & 4 others (2017) where an award of Kshs 750,000/- was awarded for general damages.26.It was submitted that a sum of Kshs 2,500,000/- would be adequate as general damages based on the violations.27.As to whether the Replying Affidavit by the Respondents is admissible as evidence, it was submitted that the deponent of the Replying Affidavit had not demonstrated that he was duly authorized to swear the Affidavit on behalf of the Respondents and as such the Replying Affidavit was fatally defective, incompetent and should be disregarded and expunged from the court record.28.Reliance was made to Order 9, rule 2 (c ) of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010 and the case of Madin Clearing and forwarding Limited V Bamburi Supermarket Limited [2022] in addressing the issue of locus standi where the deponent did not have authority from the defendant company to swear an affidavit.29.It was submitted that the Respondents did not comply with the express provisions of order 9 Rule 2 (c ) of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010 and as such the replying affidavit by Mr. Mwangangi was inadmissible.30.On who should bear the cost, reliance was made to the case of Cecilia Karuru Ngayu v Barclays Bank of Kenya & another [2016] eKLR to buttress the limb that cost follows the event.31.It was their final submission that the petition be allowed with costs having demonstrated that there were violations by the respondents on the petitioner’s child right to privacy, human dignity, personality& intellectual property rights.Determination/Analysis32.I have carefully considered the pleadings and submissions for and against the petition.33.The issue that arises for determination is whether the petitioner’s child’s rights to privacy, personality rights and intellectual rights were infringed and if so whether the petitioner is entitled to the reliefs sought.34.The Petitioner averred that sometime in march 2023, it came to his attention that while his child was taking his education at the 2ndrespondent and particularly on Friday 22ndNovember 2019, the 1strespondent published or caused be published the petitioner’s child’s image/photograph for the purposes of the 1stRespondent commercial advertisement on daily newspaper, advertising feature without the consent and authority of the petitioner.35.Article 31(c) and (d) ofthe Constitutionprovides as follows: -31.Privacy:Every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have—(a)their person, home or property searched;(b)their possessions seized;(c)information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed; or(d)the privacy of their communications infringed.36.In Jessicar Clarise Wanjiru vs Davinci Aesthetics & Reconstruction Centre & 2 Others [2017]eKLR, Mativo J, held that;“The right to privacy consists essentially in the right to live one’s life with a minimum interference. It concerns private family and home life, physical and moral integrity, honour and reputation, avoidance of being placed in a false light, non-revelation of irrelevant and embarrassing facts, unauthorized publication of private photographs, protection from disclosure of information give or received by the individual confidentially.”37.The Judge traced the history of the said right when he expressed himself as hereunder:“A person’s image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality, as it reveals the person’s unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from his or her peers. The right to the protection of one’s image is thus one of the essential components of personal development. It mainly presupposes the individual’s right to control the use of that image, including the right to refuse publication thereof. Personality rights encompass the exclusive right of an individual to market, control and profit from the commercial use of his/her name, image, likeness and persona. The distinctive characteristics of one’s image, likeness or persona include but are not limited to name, face, signature phrase, paraphernalia or action, costume or personals signature. The tort of misappropriation of personality was first introduced in Canada in the case of Krouse vs Chrysler Canada. The tort can be expressed by stating that every individual has an exclusive right to market, for financial gain, their personality, image and name, and that the law entitles an individual to protect that right, if it is invaded. The tort of misappropriation of personality can be invoked when all of the following four elements are met:a)There is an element of commercial exploitation of a person’s personality. There must be a sufficient link between the individual and the exploiting medium to establish that the plaintiff’s personality was “used” for the defendant’s commercial gain.b)The person is clearly identifiable in the medium used and to their respective community or communities.c)The person does not consent to the use of their personality.d)Damages, either emotional or financial losses, are proven although recent judicial rulings would indicate the right of privacy is recognized even in the absence of damages.”38.In South African case of Angella Wells vs. Atoll Media (PTY) Ltd & Anor, Western Cape High Court Case No. 11961/2006 that:“...the appropriation of a person’s image or likeness for the commercial benefit or advantage of another may well call for legal intervention in order to protect the individual concerned. That may not apply to the kinds of photographs or television images of crowd scenes which contain images of individuals therein. However, when the photograph is employed, as in case, for the benefit of a magazine sole to make profit, it constitutes an unjustifiable invasion of the person rights of the individual, including the person’s dignity and privacy. In this dispute, no care was exercised in respecting these core rights.”39.The right to privacy was dealt with extensively in Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) & 2 others v Republic of Kenya &10 Others [2015] eKLR where it was held that:“285.The right to privacy is guaranteed under Article 31 ofthe Constitution.286.The right to privacy has also been expressly acknowledged in international and regional covenants on fundamental rights and freedoms. It is provided for under Article 12 of the UDHR, Article 17 of the ICCPR, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and Article 14 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.287.B. Rossler in his book, The Value of Privacy (Polity, 2005) p. 72, explains the right to privacy as follows:“The concept of right to privacy demarcates for the individual realms or dimensions that he needs in order to be able to enjoy individual freedom exacted and legally safeguarded in modern societies. Such realms or dimensions of privacy substantialize the liberties that are secured because the mere securing of freedom does not in itself necessarily entail that the conditions are secured for us to be able to enjoy these liberties as we really want to”.288.As to whether there is need to protect privacy, he goes on to write that: “Protecting privacy is necessary if an individual is to lead an autonomous, independent life, enjoy mental happiness, develop a variety of diverse interpersonal relationships, formulate unique ideas, opinions, beliefs and ways of living and participate in a democratic, pluralistic society. The importance of privacy to the individual and society certainly justifies the conclusion that it is a fundamental social value, and should be vigorously protected in law. Each intrusion upon private life is demeaning not only to the dignity and spirit of the individual, but also to the integrity of the society of which the individual is part”.40.There is no doubt therefore that unjustified invasion of one’s privacy is a violation of one’s fundamental right and must be protected and where it is violated one is entitled to a relief. In this case, it is not in doubt that the Petitioner’s child’s images were taken and published and used by the respondents to advertise the school on ongoing admissions in bid to get more students to enroll in the school. Prima facie, that amounted to a violation of the Petitioner’s right unless the said action can be justified by the Respondent. In Karugaba vs. Attorney General [2003] 2 EA 489 it was held that:“The burden was on the Appellants to prove that the State or somebody else under the authority of any law has violated their rights and freedoms to publish guaranteed underthe constitution. Once that has been established, the burden shifts to the State or the person whose acts are being complained of to justify the restrictions being imposed or the continued existence of the impugned legislation.”41.The contended that in continuance of the violation and infringement of the fundamental right to privacy and human dignity of his child, on 17thmarch 2022, the 1strespondent posted and or caused to be posted his child’s image/photograph for the purposes of commercial advertisement on the respondent’s social media platform via their Facebook handle name Kitengelainternationalschools once again without the Petitioner’s consent or authority.42.It was opined that the main motive of using the petitioner’s child image was to commercially advertise the respondents which would yield profits in terms of getting more students enrolling for admissions.43.The Respondents on their Replying Affidavit dated 21stSeptember,2023 and filed in court on 22ndSeptember ,2023 sworn by Paul Mwangangi on behalf of the 1stand 2ndRespondents, wherein he deposed that they deny that the used the image of the petitioner’s child without his authorization and consent44.That the Petitioner in his application form for admission of the minor into the school expressly authorized the taking of moving or still images of the students during participation in programmed events and for use of the same by the respondent by appending his signature on the consents form on the said application.45.That the use of the student’s image was an express term of the admission contract between the petitioner and the respondents without which the respondent would not have admitted the student.46.A look at the alleged application form that the petitioner is Alleged to have consented to clearly states that the images of the students are to be used during participation in programmed events. The images provided by the petitioner clearly show images of the petitioner child being used to advertise the school as dubbed “admissions ongoing”. We can all agree that admissions ongoing is the business of the school administration and is not part of what can be defined as a school programmed event.47.To be fair, admissions is the administration affair to attract more students and thus make more profits by having more students enroll in the school. At the very least, this cannot be termed as a school programmed event being the defense of the respondent.48.Since it is admitted that the Petitioner’s image was published, that was prima facie evidence of violation of his privacy. Accordingly, the burden shifted to the Respondent to justify that the limitations to the said right. Apart from bare averments, there was no evidence that the Petitioner or his child consented to the violation of his rights. In the premises, I have no hesitation in finding that the Petitioner’s right to privacy was violated.49.As regards the right to dignity, in Ahmed Issack Hassan vs. Auditor General [2015] the Court held that:“…the right to human dignity is the foundation of all other right and together with the right to life, forms the basis for the enjoyment of all other rights…put differently thereof, if a person enjoys the other rights in the Bill of rights, the right to human dignity will automatically be promoted and protected and it will be violated if the other rights are violated”.50.It is therefore clear that by publishing the Petitioners image being advanced for ongoing admissions, the Respondent violated the Petitioner’s child right to dignity.51.As regards the damages, it is well settled that award of compensation is an appropriate and effective remedy for redress of an established infringement of a fundamental right underthe constitution. The quantum of compensation will, however, depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In the instant case it was not established that the Respondent by virtue of advertisement obtained financial gain so that the Petitioner was not compensated for use of the image in advertising. Secondly, there was no evidence of proof of injury, loss or damage to the Petitioner. Therefore, nominal damages shall suffice.52.Based on the principles stated in M W K & Another vs. Attorney General & 3 Others [2017] eKLR, I hereby enter judgment for the Petitioner against the Respondent grant the following orders:a.A Declaration that the Respondent violated the Petitioner’s child’s fundamental rights to privacy and human dignity under Articles 28 and 31 by publishing the petitioner’s image for purpose of commercial advertisements without his consent.b.An order of permanent injunction restraining the Respondent from publishing and/or using the Petitioner’s child’s image and likeness in any way in its advertisements or promotions in any way without the Petitioner’s consent and compelling the Respondent to stop any further advertisement or promotions featuring the Petitioner’s image and likeness on their pamphlets.c.Kshs 700,000/- being damages for the violation of the Petitioner’s child’s right to dignity and privacy.d.Interests and costs.JUDGMENT DELIVERED DATED & SIGNED IN OPEN COURT ON 29/7/2024 AT MACHAKOS HIGH COURT (VIRTUAL/PHYSICAL CONFERENCE).M.W.MUIGAIJUDGEIn the presence of:Ms Oguwai for the petitioner – presentGeoffrey/Patrick – Court Assistant(s)",FSO (Suing as the next of friend and father to CDCS) v Kitengela International School AthiRiver & another (Petition E008 of 2023) [2024] KEHC 9999 (KLR) (29 July 2024) (Judgment),Petition E008 of 2023,"MW Muigai, J","July 29, 2024",

That he called his sister and they went to the police station. That he reported being threatened and that Kiragu and his friend were arrested.15.This appeal herein was canvassed by way of written submissions.Appellant’s Submissions16.The appellant submitted that the learned trial magistrate omitted to undertake a crucial examination of the complainant to establish whether she was knowledgeable of the nature of oath. That however, what the trial court did was to establish that the minor victim knew her age which test is independent of the knowledge of the nature of oath. The appellant cited Section 19 of theOaths and Statutory Declarations Actas well as the cases of Johnson Muiruri v Republic (1983) KLR 445 and Peter Kariga Kiume v Republic.17.The appellant argues that the complainant in her evidence stated twice that she did not see the face of her attacker and that if her testimony is anything to go by, then there was absolutely no evidence from her that she identified the person who allegedly attacked her on the said day of the incident and at that particular time of the night. The appellant stated that the trial court misdirected itself by arriving at a conviction on the basis of the testimonies of the two minor witnesses who told court that there was no light in the bedroom that they were sleeping in that night. Also, that it would appear the trial court partially based its findings on the evidence of the complainant’s father PW1, who allegedly met him prior to the alleged incident and who then suspected that he was the one who committed the offence because he had seen him with a screw driver.18.The appellant cited the case of Cleophas Otieno Wamunga v Rep. Cr. App No. 20 of 1989 where the Court of Appeal held: -Evidence of visual identification in criminal cases can bring about miscarriages of justice and it is of vital importance that such evidence is examined carefully to minimize this danger. Whenever the case against a defendant depends wholly or to a great extent on the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused which he alleges to be mistaken, the Court must warn itself of the special need for caution before convicting the defendant in reliance on the correctness of the identification.19.The appellant submitted that the trial court based its findings on the hypothetical evidence of the complainant’s father contrary to the basic principles of criminal justice which demand that the prosecution must adduce evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant cited the case of Teper v Rep (1952) where the Court of Appeal held that: -Circumstantial evidence must always be narrowly examined, if only because evidence of this kind may be fabricated to cast suspicion on another. It was also necessary before drawing the inference of the accused’s guilt from circumstantial evidence to be sure that there are no other co-existing circumstances which would weaken or destroy the inference.20.The appellant pointed out that courts have grappled with the issue of mandatory minimum penal provisions, for instance, in the case of Philip Mueke Maingi & 5 Others v Rep. Const. Pet. No. E017 of 2021 where the superior court in the case held that all accused persons deserve to have their mitigation taken into account, and equally any court is bestowed with the legitimate discretion to impose sentences that befit the offences committed. The appellant argued that the sentence of 10 years imprisonment imposed upon him deprived the court of its legitimate discretion in sentencing him. The appellant therefore prayed that the conviction is quashed and sentence set aside.Analysis and Determination21.This being the first appellate court, it is guided by the principles in David Njuguna Wairimu v Republic [2010] eKLR where the court of appeal held: -“The duty of the first appellate court is to analyze and re-evaluate the evidence which was before the trial court and itself come to its own conclusions on that evidence without overlooking the conclusions of the trial court. There are instances where the first appellate court may, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, come to the same conclusions as those of the lower court. It may rehash those conclusions. We do not think there is anything objectionable in doing so, provided it is clear that the court has considered the evidence on the basis of the law and the evidence to satisfy itself on the correctness of the decisions.”22.After considering the grounds of appeal, records of the trial court and submissions, the issues for determination are as follows: -i.Whether voire dire examination conducted on the complainant was unequivocalii.Whether the appellant was properly identified as the perpetrator considering the circumstancesiii.Whether the sentence was harsh and excessiveWhether voire dire examination conducted on the complainant was unequivocal23.Voire dire examination was done and it was up to the trial magistrate to draw the conclusion whether the witness of tender years had the capacity to testifying on oath. That was done before PW2 and PW3 testified and the trial magistrate concluded that they were possessed of sufficient knowledge warranting them to testify on oath. During voire dire examination of PW2 and PW3, the appellant did not question the competence of the said examination. He went ahead to cross examine PW2 and PW3 exhaustively and that cross examination went further to prove that the 2 witnesses though of tender age understood the importance of telling the truth.Whether the appellant was properly identified as the perpetrator considering the circumstances24.PW2 said she did not see the face of the person who removed her clothes and started touching her but she knew it was Kiragu, the friend of her father. She said that she thought it was her father and when she called him he said “mmmh” and went behind the curtain. PW3 said he heard the sister talking to the intruder and asking if he was their father but by then their parents had gone to prepare mahamri. PW3 said he saw that it was Kiragu because he had a board for advertising houses for sale. He also said that there was light from the sitting room and from security light. PW3 said that he saw the intruder had a jacket with a hoodie and he also had small dreadlocks. PW3 said he did not see the accused touch his sister.25.In the case of Francis Kariuki Njiru & 7 others v Republic (2001) eKLR, it was held as follow: -“The law on identification is well settled, and this Court has from time to time said that the evidence relating to identification must be scrutinized carefully, and should only be accepted and acted upon if the Court is satisfied that the identification is positive and free from the possibility of error. The surrounding circumstances must be considered (See R. vs. Turnbull (1976) 63 Civil Appeal R.132). Among the factors the Court is required to consider is whether the eye witness gave a description of his or her attacker or attackers to the police at the earliest opportunity or at all. This Court, in Mohamed Elibite Hibuy & Another vs. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 1996 (unreported) held that: -“If (sic) is for the prosecution to elicit during evidence as to whether the witness had observed the features of the culprit and if so, the conspicuous details regarding his features given to anyone particularly to the police at the first opportunity. Both the investigation officer and the prosecutor have to ensure that such information is recorded during investigation and elicited in court during evidence. Omissions of evidence of this nature at investigation stage or at the time of prosecution in court has, depending on the particular circumstances of a case, proved fatal – this being a proven reliable way of testing the power of observation, and accuracy of memory of a witness and the degree of consistency in his evidence.”26.The offence was allegedly committed at night and PW3 who was with the complainant in the same bedroom did not see the appellant touching the complainant because he was asleep and he was woken up when PW2 asked the intruder if he was their father. PW2 said she did not see the face of the person properly but she said she knew him. She said when she called thinking that it was her father, the person went behind the curtain. She also said the person was tall. That evidence goes to show that PW2 was not sure who the person who had accessed the house after their parents left was.27.PW3 on the other hand said that he saw the intruder who entered the house at 2.00 am was was Kiragu and that there was light in the sitting. PW3 did not say how the light went through the curtains on the door to the bedroom to enable him properly identify the intruder. He did not properly identify the intruder who was wearing a jacket with a hoodie. PW3 did not say how he was able to see small dreadlocks on the appellant’s head if he was wearing a hoodie.28.None of the items that were stolen from the house namely, money, gas cylinder and phone were recovered from the appellant to corroborate the allegation that he committed the offence herein. This court finds that the circumstances surrounding the identification were not conducive for proper identification.29.In consideration that the perpetrator was not properly identified and in consideration that the investigating officer did not testify, this court finds that it was unsafe for the trial magistrate to convict the appellant on the insufficient evidence of the prosecution. The appeal herein is merited, the conviction is quashed and sentence set aside.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED IN OPEN COURT/ONLINE THROUGH MS TEAMS, THIS 22THDAY OF FEBRUARY 2024HON. LADY JUSTICE A.

      [2024] KEHC 1717 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at BungomaCriminal Appeal E089 of 2023DK Kemei, JFebruary 22, 2024BetweenJJWAppellantandRepublicRespondent(Being an appeal against the conviction and sentence of Hon G. Adhiambo (PM) in Kimilili Principal Magistrates’ Court Sexual Offence Case No. E029 of 2022 dated 31.10.2022)Judgment1.The Appellant, Jacob Juma Wangamati, was charged before the Principal Magistrate’s Court at Kimilili in Sexual Offences Case No. E029 of 2022 with the offence of incest contrary to section 20(1) of theSexual Offences ActNo. 3 of 2006. The particulars were that the Appellant, on 4thApril 2022 while at [particulars withheld] in Bungoma North Sub-County within Bungoma County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of S.N.G, a girl child aged Six (6) years whom he knew to be his daughter.2.The Appellant also faced a second count of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of theSexual Offences Act, No. 3 of 2006. The particulars were that the Appellant, on 4thApril 2022 while at [particulars withheld] in Bungoma North Sub-County within Bungoma County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of S.N.G, a girl child aged Six (6) years.3.The Appellant also faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of theSexual Offences ActNo. 3 of 2006. The particulars are that on 4thday of April,2022 at [particulars withheld] in Bungoma North sub-County within Bungoma County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to come into contact with the vagina of S.N.G a girl child aged Six (6) years.4.After a full trial, the learned trial Magistrate found the Appellant guilty on the main count in count one and sentenced him to serve fifty (50) years’ imprisonment.5.Being dissatisfied with both conviction and sentence, the Appellant lodged this appeal filed on 3rdSeptember 2022. In his petition of appeal, the Appellant raised six grounds of appeal as follows:a.That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact in convicting him without proper inquiry and investigations.b.That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact in conducting proceedings that violated the rights of the appellant.c.That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact when she considered extraneous factors in her decision making.d.That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by basing his conviction on speculation and contradictions from the prosecution’s side.e.That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting the appellant on the weakness of his defence thus rejecting his alibi defence.6.The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. It is only the Appellant who complied.7.The duty of a first appellate Court was authoritatively stated by the Supreme Court of India in the recent decision in the case of K. Anbazhagan v. State of Karnataka and Others, (Criminal Appeal No. 637 of 2015) where a three-Judge Bench addressing the manner of exercise of jurisdiction by the appellate court while deciding an appeal ruled that:-“The appellate court has a duty to make a complete and comprehensive appreciation of all vital features of the case. The evidence brought on record in entirety has to be scrutinized with care and caution. It is the duty of the Judge to see that justice is appropriately administered, for that is the paramount consideration of a Judge. The said responsibility cannot be abdicated or abandoned or ostracized, even remotely, ..........The appellate court is required to weigh the materials, ascribe concrete reasons and the filament of reasoning must logically flow from the requisite analysis of the material on record. The approach cannot be cryptic. It cannot be perverse. The duty of the Judge is to consider the evidence objectively and dispassionately. The reasoning in appeal are to be well deliberated. They are to be resolutely expressed. An objective judgment of the evidence reflects the greatness of mind – sans passion and sans prejudice. The reflective attitude of the Judge must be demonstrable from the judgment itself. A judge must avoid all kind of weakness and vacillation. That is the sole test. That is the litmus test.”8.The prosecution called five witnesses in support of its case. PW1 was Violet Nakhumicha who told the Court that she is the Complainant’s mother. According to her, on 4thApril 2022 she left the house with instructions that PW2 was to sit with the baby and ensure that she is not exposed to the cold. On getting back home, she found her other daughter with the baby and that PW2 was nowhere in sight. On enquiring, she was told that PW2 was at her brother-in-law’s house and she instructed that she be called. On PW2’s arrival she instructed her to serve her with tea only to notice that she had dried up tears on her face. She enquired on what exactly was the problem and it appeared like that she wanted to cry again. PW2 later informed her that she was afraid to tell her as she did not want her to beat her. She beseeched her to confide in her and PW2 briefed her on what the Appellant did to her. According to her, PW2 sated that the Appellant did bad manners to her and on asking again she reiterated the same. This prompted her to undress PW2’s lower body where she noticed blood and mucosal fluid on her inner pant. She reported the matter to the Police Post and later took PW2 to Makutano Health Centre. She was later referred to Kiminini Police station where they recorded their statements and was later referred to Naitiri Sub-County Hospital. She told the Court that PW2 is the biological child of the Appellant.On cross-examination, she told the Court that the Appellant defiled his own daughter and that he even assaulted her when she confronted him about it.9.PW2, the Complainant herein, a six (6) year old girl at date of trial was put through a voire dire examination and that the trial Magistrate made a finding that she did not appreciate the nature of an oath and therefore gave unsworn evidence.It was her evidence that the Appellant herein is her father and that on 4thApril 2022, while at home with the small baby, her father removed her panty and dress and inserted his thing in the hole where the faeces come from. She told the Court that the Appellant removed his trouser, biker and vest leaving him naked, and did that to her while the baby was lying next to her. She told the Court that the Appellant held her throat making it impossible for her to scream as he laid on her and inserted his thing inside her. On finishing, he dressed her and left. She told the Court that when she was outside, she noticed blood and mucus coming from the there (pointing between her buttocks). She told her mother about everything and they reported the incident to the police and she was taken to the hospital. She identified the Appellant as the man who defiled her.On cross-examination, she told the Court that the Appellant laid on her and inserted his thing inside her. According to her, on that day the Appellant stated that he was not going to work and that she never ate any guavas.10.After a brief voire dire examination, the Court formed the view that PW3-A.M.S did not appreciate the nature of an oath and therefore gave unsworn evidence.It was her evidence that the Appellant herein is her father and that PW2 is her sister. She recalled on 4thApril 2022, while at home her mother left instructions that PW2 should watch over the baby. She proceeded to fetch milk leaving the Appellant seated on the bench (She points to the Appellant in Court). She told the Court that she left PW2 lying on the bed with the baby and as she left she saw her father entering their house. When she got back home she found PW2 crying and she refused to carry the baby. On enquiring on what exactly the problem was, she refused to tell her. She proceeded to prepare tea and do her morning chores. Later, one mama Anne told her to get PW2’s clothes as she was washing PW2, which she found strange. She later heard PW2 screaming as she was being washed and on-going to find the problem she saw PW2’s pant had mucus and blood coming from the pant. On the screams becoming more intensive, one mama Anna stopped washing her leaving her to continue and apply oil on PW2. She testified that she later dressed her up, prepared tea and that PW2 did not inform her about what had happened. When PW1 got back home, PW2 informed her that the Appellant did bad manners to her.On cross-examination, she told the Court that she did not see the Appellant doing the bad manners to PW2 but that PW2 claimed that he did it and that it is not PW1 who told her to say so.11.PW4 was Erick Murenga who testified that he is a clinical officer working at Makutano Health Centre in Tongaren Sub-County. According to him, on 8thApril 2022 at 5pm, PW2 in the company of PW1 walked into the facility with a history of fecal incontinence and that PW2 had been defiled by the father at their home when PW1 was not around. On examination of PW2, he established that her vaginal and anal area were communicating, meaning her vaginal area had been damaged, and that her vaginal canal and hymen had raptured leading to faeces passing through her vaginal area. Further, the incident occurred on 4thApril 2022 and they sought treatment on 8thApril 2022. He noted that PW2 also had a viscous vaginal fistula prompting him to refer her to Kitale County Referral Hospital for surgical repair. He formed the opinion that PW2 had been defiled. He produced in Court PW2’s P3form filled by him dated 8thApril 2022 as PEXH2, treatment notes from Makutano Health Centre as PEXH1 and post rape care form as PEXH3.On cross-examination, he told the Court that based on his examination of PW2’s genital area, he opined that it was severely damaged and that the anal area was gaping. He further testified that when one eats guavas they can get constipation and cannot pass stool and if the rectal area is damaged stool passes uncontrollably and that constipation as a result of eating guava cannot cause such injuries.12.PW5 was No. 227858 PC Cleophas Makokha Musungu, who testified that he is based at Soysambu Patrol Base and that on 7thApril 2022 at 8.30 pm PW1, PW2 and PW3 came to make a report that PW2 had been defiled by her father who is the Appellant herein. As it was late in the night, he advised her to take PW2 to the hospital the next morning. He then proceeded to investigate the report and after the medical officer established PW2 had been defiled, he proceeded to arrest the Appellant. He took PW2 to Kitale County Referral Hospital for an age assessment. He produced in Court PW2’s age assessment report as PEXH4. He testified that the inner pant of PW2 worn on the date of the incident had blood stains and that the same is white in colour. He produced the blood-stained white pant in Court as PEXH5.On cross-examination, he testified that the Appellant did not run away after the incident as he found him at his home and that the medical officer did confirm that PW2 was defiled.13.Upon closure of the prosecution’s case, it is evident that section 211 of Criminal Procedure Code was complied with. The Appellant stated that he would tender sworn evidence and that he would call one witness.14.It was his defence that he did not commit the crime and that PW2 only ate guavas. He told the Court that PW1 informed him the previous day that PW2 got inured only for her to change the story and allege that he had defiled PW2. He added that PW1 later disappeared from their home from 4thand she came back on 8ththen he was arrested.15.DW2 was Yvonne Mukasi, who testified that the Appellant herein is her neighbour. According to her, she saw PW2 as she had come to her home and was unable to go for a long call and on enquiring what was the problem, PW2 informed her that she had consumed a lot of guavas. She took her to her grandmother who took two sticks and removed faeces from the anus of the child. She told the Court that PW2 did not go for a long call for three days. After, PW2 left happy and climbed the tree and continued to eat more guavas.On cross-examination, she told the Court that she took PW2 to her grandmother on 8thto handle the issue of PW2’s inability to pass stool but could not recall the month and that they never touched PW2’s vagina but only assisted her to go for a long call.16.It is upon the above evidence that the trial magistrate based the conviction. She captured the evidence well including that the Complainant who was then aged Six (6) years, is the daughter of the Appellant herein and that the father denied that anything happened on the day of 4thApril 2022 when the offence of incest is alleged to have been committed upon the victim by the Appellant.17.I have reviewed the evidence on record and the relevant law. Section 20 (1) of theSexual Offences ActNo. 3 of 2006 provides that: -20 (1) Any male person who commits an indecent act or an act which causes penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years.Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.18.To establish a case under the above section, the prosecution must prove the elements of the offence. There must be an indecent act or an act which causes penetration. Further, the victim must be a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother.19.The Appellant is the biological father of the complainant herein. I find no difficulty in believing that the complainant is a female person within the above definition and that the Appellant is her father and that the Appellant knew her to be his daughter. These basic truths which are essential ingredients of the offence of incest were not contested at all.20.It is also necessary to bear in mind the definition of penetration which is defined in the Act as ‘the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person.’21.It is important at this stage to mention that the evidence adduced established the act of penetration. The trial Court made findings that there was overwhelming evidence vide PW4 as stated in the treatment notes, PRC and P3 form that penetration was committed on the complainant in that the complainant's hymen and vaginal canal was severely raptured, leading to fecal incontinence through the vaginal area. PW4 further testified that even if the complainant consumed guavas, the constipation as a result of the same could not cause the injuries he observed during his examination of the complainant herein. The lapse of time from the date the offence was allegedly committed and the time it was reported did not weaken the evidence since the complainant, PW1 and PW2 explained in a consistent manner how PW2’s grandmother took physical custody of PW2 and PW3 locking them up in her house from 4thApril 2022 to 7thApril 2022. PW3 also confirmed that their grandmother locked them up in her bedroom and PW2 kept complaining of feeling pain in her vagina. This explains why the incident was reported at the Police Station on 7thApril 2022 and medical attention sought on 8thApril 2022.22.The learned magistrate who had the benefit of seeing the witnesses testify believed the above evidence. Upon evaluating and analyzing the evidence, i also find it to be consistent, trustworthy and clear. The proviso to Section 124 of theEvidence Act, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya provides:-“Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth”23.The reasons recorded by the Court while believing the above testimony is that PW2 was left in-charge of the baby while PW3 was directed to go purchase some milk. According to PW3, she left PW2 lying next to the baby in bed and that the Appellant was just at home. PW2 testified that on the morning of 4thApril 2022, after PW3 left home to purchase milk, the Appellant came to where she was lying on the bed with the baby fast asleep on the bedside, he directed her to lie on her back or else he will strangle her. The Appellant removed her inner pant, undressed himself and inserted his penis into her anus from behind causing her injuries and pain. She told the Court that the Appellant left her with dirt on the pant and between her buttocks. She told the Court that as her father defiled her, he squeezed her throat to prevent her from screaming. When the Appellant was done, he told her to dress up and leave. The Appellant also dressed up as he was naked, and went to sit in the house and drink his busaa. The trial magistrate also noted that PW2’s evidence is corroborated by the medical evidence which clearly indicated that she was defiled and that the incident occasioned her serious injuries that required corrective surgery. The trial magistrate observed that the treatment notes, P3 form and Post Care Rape form produced by PW4 as PEXH 1, PEXH 2 and PEXH 3 respectively bore contents that were consistent with his testimony and that of PW2.24.In my view, despite her tender age, the complainant was clear in her testimony. On the contrary, the defence offered by the Appellant did not cast doubts on the prosecution’s case. Having subjected the entire record to a fresh scrutiny, i find no contradictions which if resolved in the Appellant’s favour would create a doubt in the Prosecution’s case. I am satisfied that the prosecution proved the offence of incest and that the necessary ingredients of the offence as enumerated above where proved beyond doubt. I find that the evidence adduced proved the offence of incest, hence the conviction was supported by the evidence on record and i uphold the conviction.25.On the sentence, it is important to recall that the complainant was aged 6 years at the time of the offence. Age was not contested, but was also proved as required in this case. Commenting on the age of a victim in cases of this nature, the Court of Appeal in Kaingu Elias Kasomo vs Republic (Criminal Appeal no. 504 of 2010 cited in Martin Nyongesa Wanyonyi vs Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 661 of 2010) had this to say:-“Age of the victim of sexual assault under theSexual Offences Actis a critical component. It forms part of the charge which must be proved the same way as penetration in the cases of rape and defilement. It is therefore essential that the same be proved by credible evidence for the sentence to be imposed will be dependent on the age of the victim”.26.Sentencing is the discretion of the trial Court but such discretion must be exercised judiciously and not capriciously. The trial Court must be guided by the evidence and sound legal principles. It must take into account all relevant factors and elude all extraneous or irrelevant factors. Certainly, the appellate Court would be entitled to interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial Court if it is demonstrated that the sentence imposed is not legal or is so harsh and excessive as to amount to miscarriage of justice, and or that the Court acted upon wrong principle or if the Court exercised its discretion capriciously. See Makhandia J (as he then was) in Simon Ndungu Murage vs Republic, Criminal appeal No. 275 of 2007, Nyeri.27.The Supreme Court of India in State of M.P. vs Bablu Natt {2009}2S.C.C 272 Para 13 stated that ‘the principle governing imposition of punishment would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. An offence which affects the morale of the society should be severely dealt with.’28.In Shadrack Kipchoge Kogo vs Republic,Criminal Appeal No. 253 of 2003(Eldoret), Omolo, Okubasu & Onyango JJA) the Court of Appeal stated:-“Sentence is essentially an exercise of the trial court and for this court to interfere, it must be shown that in passing the sentence, the court took into account an irrelevant factor or that a wrong principle was applied or short of those the sentence was so harsh and excessive that an error in principle must be inferred”29.The proviso to Section 20 (1) of theSexual Offences Actprovides that:-Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.30.I have carefully considered the facts of this case, the severity of the offence, the principles of proportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation and as part of the proportionality analysis, the mitigating and aggravating factors, considering the the age of the victim at the time of the offence, the scar the incidence left in her life, the health and social implications, the relationship of the Appellant and the victim being a father and a person the child looked upon for up bringing, protection, guidance and the position of trust the Appellant had as a parent of the child.31.I have also considered the purpose of sentencing and the principles of sentencing under the common law (Regina vs MA {2004}145A) which are:-i.To ensure that the offender is adequately punished;ii.To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;iii.To protect the community from the offender;iv.To promote the rehabilitation of the offender;v.To make the offender accountable for his or her actions;vi.To denounce the conduct of the offender.vii.To recognize the harm done to the victims of the crime and the community.32.Guided by the above principles and considering the aggravating factors in this case and bearing in mind the sentence prescribed under the law for an offence of this nature, and considering that sentencing is the discretion of the Court and can only be interfered with if is shown that in passing the sentence, the Court took into account an irrelevant factor or that a wrong principle was applied or short of those the sentence was so harsh and excessive that an error in principle must be inferred. The sentence imposed is for protection of society against predators like the Appellant. It is my finding and holding that the sentence imposed was lawful, appropriate and justified in the circumstances. Indeed, the complainant was then aged 6 years at the time of the offence and that as per the proviso to section 20(1) of theSexual Offences ActNo.3 of 2006 the sentence could be enhanced to life imprisonment. The sentence imposed is lawful and commensurate with the Appellant’s blameworthiness. I find no reason to interfere with the same. I dismiss the appeal herein and uphold the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate.33.The up-shot is that this appeal against conviction and sentence lacks merit. The same is dismissed. The conviction and sentence is upheld.It is ordered.Dated and delivered at Bungoma this 22NDday Of February 2024.D.

The Applicant has also sought the assistance of the OCS, Runyenjes police station in the enforcement of the order sought.The Landlord’s depositions2.The Landlord’s affidavits in support of his Application may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Tenant has closed and deserted the suit premises since March 2022 and has not paid any rent since the said month and year and has therefore accumulated rent arrears amounting to Kshs. 630,000/=.The Tenant’s Replying affidavit3.The Tenant’s replying affidavit sworn on 31.5.2024 may be summarized as follows;-a.That the Tenant runs a milling plant in the suit premises where he has installed heavy machinery and he has been in the premises for five years.b.That in the month of November 2023, the Tenant was unable to carry out the day to day running of the business and he therefore entered into an agreement with the landlord that he would close down the premises until such a time that he was able to uninstall his machinery which activity required a lot of resources.c.That the Tenant admits to being in arrears of Kshs. 240,000/= and not Kshs. 630,000/= as alleged by the Landlord.d.That it was agreed between the parties that the Landlord would be paid the rent arrears in eight monthly installments by postdated cheques of Kshs. 30,000/= per month.e.That the Tenant is willing to move out of the suit premises by June 2024.The Landlord’s Further depositions4.The Landlord has denied in his further affidavit that there was an agreement to close down the premises but retain the machinery therein and has further denied that there was even an agreement to pay the rent arrears in installments.5.While stating that the total rent owed is Kshs. 630,000/=, the Landlord has also denied that there was an agreement that the Tenant would leave the suit premises in June 2024.6.The Landlord has further deponed that the Tenant intends to vacate the suit premises without paying rent.Analysis and determination7.The only issue that arises for determination in this Application is whether the Landlord is entitled to the orders sought in the Application.8.It is not contested that the Tenant is in rent arrears. The Tenant admits to owing rent in the sum of Kshs. 240,000/= while the Landlord maintains that the rent owed is Kshs. 630,000/=. The Landlord has not provided a statement of account for the Tenant and neither has he produced a rent book as required under Section 3(3) of Cap 301. Between the two depositions, it is therefore not possible to state the exact rent owed in arrears but for the purposes of the Landlord’s Application, it suffices that the Tenant admits to being in rent arrears for a period of eight (8) months.9.The Landlord’s right to levy distress for rent is reserved under Section 3(1) of theDistress for Rent Act, Cap 29 of the Laws of Kenya which provides as follows;-“Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other written law, any person having any rent or rent service in arrears and due upon a grant, lease, demise or contract, shall have the same remedy by distress for the recovery of that rent or rent service as is given by the common law of England in a similar case.”It is therefore clear that the Tenant in the instant case has fallen into rent arrears admittedly for a period of eight (8) months, the right of the Landlord to levy distress for rent has therefore crystalized.10.The Tenant has deponed that it was agreed between the parties that the admitted rent arrears would be paid in monthly installments of Kshs. 30,000/= and the Tenant has exhibited postdated cheques to that effect. The Landlord has denied that there was any agreement for payment of the rent in installments. Again, it is the word of the Tenant against that of the Landlord as there was no written agreement between the parties for the payment of rent in installments.11.In the schedule to Section 3 of Cap 301, paragraph VIII thereof provides that “the lessee shall pay rent for the premises in advance.”In the absence of an express agreement between the parties that the rent would be paid in arrears, it is my finding that the Tenant was in default of that implied term of his tenancy.12.In the circumstances, I do find merit in the Landlord’s Application and allow the same in the following terms;-a.That the Landlord is granted leave to break into the suit premises and to therein levy distress for rent.b.That the OCS, Runyenjes police station does provide security during the enforcement of the orders issued herein.c.That the Tenant shall bear the costs of the Application.d.That the prayer for vacant possession in the Complaint dated 15.4.2024 is declined for failure by the Landlord to comply with the provisions of Section 4 of Cap 301 as far as the issuance of a termination notice is concerned.e.That this file is ordered closed and the Reference determined in the above terms.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 9THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024HON.

TA Madowo, Senior Resident Magistrate, SRM, of 25th June 2024)Ruling1.The revision cause herein was initiated by way of a letter, dated 26thJune 2024. It seeks revision of an order made on 25thJune 2024.2.The trial court had allowed the police to detain the applicant for 10 days, to enable completion of investigations. The complaint by the applicant was that, although he had applied for bond, his plea was neither granted nor denied, for the court did not mention anything about that, except that it extended the time within which he could be held in custody, before being arraigned.3.The matter was placed before me, on 26thJune 2024, and I directed that it be argued before me on 27thJune 2024, given that it turned on the fundamental right to freedom. It was argued orally on the said date, by Mr. Ouma for the applicant, and Ms Mutela and Mr. Mumo for the Republic. Mr. Ouma argued that the order of 25thJune 2024 was ambiguous, to the extent that it neither granted bail, nor denied it, and, in any event, no reasons were given for denying bail. The Republic argued that the order bore no ambiguity.4.The parties placed before me Michael Rotich vs. Republic [2016] eKLR (Kimaru. J), Betty Jemutai Kimeiywa vs. Republic [2018] eKLR (Muriithi, J) and Chris Philip Obure vs. Republic [2020] eKLR (Wakiaga, J), to guide me on the matter.5.I reserved 2ndJuly 2024, as the date for delivery of the ruling on the matter, but the passing on of my mother, on 30thJune 2024, meant that I had to take compassionate leave to deal with that bereavement, and I was unable to prepare and deliver the ruling on the date scheduled, and I regret the prejudice that that caused the parties. It could be that the matter has since been overtaken by events.6.The application, that the Republic had made, was for extension of time to detain the applicant pending completion of investigations. It is provided for, under section 36A of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75, Laws of Kenya. The court allowed 10 days. The matter was not an arraignment for plea, where the issue of bond would arise. It was for extension of time to detain, for the purposes of investigations. It cannot be that extension of time to detain is sought, and then admission to bond is sought at the same time. It is a question of the court either allowing the extension or not, for it cannot allow the same, yet admit the suspect to bond, for that would defeat the purpose of the extension.7.Did the trial court act illegally, or unlawfully, or irregularly, or improperly, in grant of the extension? The applicant has not demonstrated any illegality, or irregularity, or impropriety in the manner the order was made.8.I find no basis for the revision sought, and I hereby disallow the request for it. It is so ordered.DELIVERED, DATED AND SIGNED IN CHAMBERS, AT BUSIA,THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W MUSYOKAJUDGEMr. Arthur Etyang, Court Assistant.AdvocatesMr. Otieno, instructed by Messrs.

Chitembwe, J.) dated 24th October 2019 in  Civil Appeal No. 57 of 2018)Judgment1.By plaint filed on 27thOctober 2017, the respondent, Purity Kanini (suing as the next friend to Edward Koome), sought general and special damages from the appellant, Kenya Wildlife Service, following snake bite injuries suffered by the minor, Edward Koome, on 4thNovember 2015. What had happened was that the minor was herding goats in his parents’ farm when he was bitten by a snake on his right elbow. The farm was near Murerwa National Park. The minor was admitted at Maua General Hospital for 4 days while on oxygen support. He was subsequently subjected to physiotherapy. The incident was reported to the community warden at Murerwa National Park. In suing the appellant, it was claimed that there was negligence    in failing to keep the snake under control and thereby allowing it to attack the respondent; that the wildlife had negligently left its designated area to go and injure the respondent.2.The claim was resisted by the appellant. It was denied that the appellant had been negligent, as it was common knowledge that in the area in question snakes naturally co-existed with human beings; that the appellant had no duty to control and manage wildlife found in private properties. The appellant denied that it was entitled to compensate the respondent for the injuries to the minor. Lastly, the appellant pleaded that under section 25(3) of theWildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013 the respondent ought to have launched the claim to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee for its verification and review before recommending to the Cabinet Secretary responsible for Wildlife Conservation and Management for payment; that the appellant was not responsible to pay such a claim, and neither did the Chief Magistrate’s Court have the jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute.3.The Chief Magistrate’s Court at Maua heard the dispute and, while dismissing the plea it lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute, found the appellant liable in negligence, and awarded Kshs.3,000,000 in compensation.4.The appellant was aggrieved by the verdict and appealed to the High Court at Meru. The learned S. Chitembwe, J. heard the appeal and found no reasons to interfere with the decision of the trial court. The learned Judge acknowledged that there were two conflicting decisions by this Court on the question whether in such situation the trial court was duty bound to refer the dispute before it to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee under section 25(3) of the Act or could assume jurisdiction and hear and determine the dispute. The Judge found that the High Court had both the original and appellate jurisdiction to handle the dispute.5.The appellant was not satisfied with the decision, hence this appeal whose grounds were as follows:-“1)That the learned Judge erred in law in dismissing the appellant’s appeal and in holding that the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Maua had the requisite Jurisdiction to hear and determine the respondent’s suit in Maua CMCC No. 192 of 2017.2.That the learned Judge erred in law in failing to find that the Chief Magistrate’s Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the respondent’s suit in Maua CMCC No. 192 of 2017 in light of the provisions of section 25 of theWildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013, as read together with Section 117 of the same Act.3.That the learned Judge erred in law by upholding the award of Kshs.3,000,000/= made to the respondent as general damages and which amount is excessively      high that there must be an erroneous estimate of the damages payable to the respondent, if any.4.That the decision and judgment of the learned Judge is against the law against the weight of evidence on record.”6.In the submission by learned counsel Mr. Kariuki for the appellant, it was the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee that had the jurisdiction to verify, adjudicate and ascertain the compensation, if at all, that was payable following the snake bite injury to the minor; that the trial court lacked original jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute. It was submitted that the learned Judge had erred when he did not find that the respondent had been guilty of failing to exhaust the procedure availed by section 25(1) and 117 of the Act. While referring to the decision in the Speaker of the National Assembly -vs- Karume [2008] IKLR 426 EP), learned counsel’s case was that section 25(1) of the Act created a compulsory requirement for the respondent to exhaust the procedure provided before moving to the court.7.On the learned Judge’s finding that the use of “may” instead of “shall” by the section meant that the respondent had an option to either go to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee or to court, learned counsel referred us to the decision of this Court in Peter Muturi Njuguna -vs- Kenya Wildlife Service [2017]eKLR in which the Court was dealing with section 62(1) of the Wildlife (Conservation and    Management) Act, Cap 376 (now repealed) which was similar to the present section 25(1) as regards the use of “may” instead of “shall”. This Court had gone on to find that, that notwithstanding, the specific procedure provided under the Act had to be strictly followed to address the human versus wildlife conflict in the country; that the procedure under the Act was quick and less bureaucratic.8.Learned counsel Mr. Mwanzia for the respondent supported the findings by the learned Judge on the question of jurisdiction, and asked us to dismiss the appeal with costs. Counsel pointed out that the learned Judge was confronted with two Court of Appeal decisions on the question of jurisdiction following injury of wildlife, and the two decisions were Peter Muturi Njuguna (Supra) andKenya Wildlife Service -vs- Joseph Musyoki Kilonzo, Civil Appeal No. 306 of 2015. In the later case, this Court had, in interpreting section 25(1) of the Act, found that the section did not oust the jurisdiction of the court as the aggrieved party had an option to go to the Committee as a first option or go to court. The learned Judge had opted to follow this interpretation and could not be faulted, it was argued.9.We have anxiously considered this appeal. We remember that our mandate on second appeal is to determine matters of law, and not to interfere with the findings of fact by the two courts below, unless it is shown that the two courts considered matters, they should not have considered or failed to consider    matters they should have considered. (See Stanley N. Muriithi & another -vs- Bernard Munene Ithiga [2016]eKLR.10.The question for our determination is whether the learned Judge erred when he found that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute between the respondent and the appellant, given the admitted facts regarding the injury suffered by the respondent following the snake attack on a private property next to the national park.11.It is trite that a court can only proceed to hear and determine the dispute if it has jurisdiction. If it does not, it has to down its tools (See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lilian S” -vs- Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989]eKLR). In S.K. Macharia -vs- Kenya Commercial Bank, Civil Application No. 2 of 2012, the Supreme Court stated that the jurisdiction can only be conferred on a court bythe Constitutionor Statute, and a court cannot therefore otherwise act than within the jurisdiction properly conferred on it.12.Section 18 of the Act establishes the County Conservation and Compensation Committee. Under section 19, its mandate includes the review and recommendation of claims resulting from loss or damage caused by wildlife for payment of compensation. Section 25 provides as follows:-“(1)Where any person suffers any bodily injury    or is killed by any wildlife listed under the  Third Schedule, the person injured, or in the case of a deceased person, the personal representative or successor or assign, may launch a claim to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee within the jurisdiction established under this Act.2.The County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee established under section 18 shall verify a claim made under subsection (1) and upon verification, submit the claim to the Cabinet Secretary together with its recommendations thereon.3.The Cabinet Secretary shall consider the recommendations made under subsection4.and where appropriate, pay compensation to the claimant as follows    —a.in the case of death, five million shillings;b.in the case of injury occasioning permanent disability, three million shillings;c.in the case of any other injury, a maximum of two million shillings, depending on the extent of injury.”Put briefly, a person injured by a wildlife may launch a claim to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee to verify the claim and recommend to the Cabinet Secretary for payment.13.This Court in Kenya Wildlife Service -vs- Joseph Musyoki Kilonzo (Supra) considered section 25 of the Act in a case where the respondent’s deceased daughter, aged 13 years old,    had been attacked by a crocodile while fetching water from Tana River in Tseikuru District. The crocodile dragged the deceased daughter into the river. The remains of the battered body were recovered three days later. The respondent therein filed a claim for compensation with Kenya Wildlife Service. He completed some claim forms as provided for under the Act and submitted them for processing and payment of compensation as provided for under section 25(3). He continued following up the claim but the appellant failed to pay. Left with no other option, the respondent moved to the High Court in Garissa and lodged his claim. The question for determination was whether the High Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matters arising from claims premised on the said Act. The appellant therein argued that section 25(3) of the Act ousted the jurisdiction of the Court; that section 24 created a non-fault compensation scheme outlined therein that must be followed for such compensation to be paid.14.The Court of Appeal observed that the respondent therein had indeed lodged a complaint pursuant to the Act, which complaint was ignored by the appellant. In the circumstances, the respondent did not err in filing a suit before the High Court in order to get a remedy. It was further observed that the use of “may” under section 25(1) and the absence of any provision expressly limiting or ousting the jurisdiction of the High Court meant that the aggrieved party had the option to pursue its    claim either through the process under the Act, or through the court.15.In Peter Muturi Njuguna -vs- Kenya Wildlife Service (Supra), the facts were that the appellant was working on his farm in Kabazi area in Nakuru when he was suddenly attacked by a wild pig. It bit off his right index finger causing severe pain and other minor injuries. The appellant reported to the offices of the respondent and was advised to lodge his compensation claim, which he did. But the respondent did nothing for over four (4) years. The appellant went before the magistrate’s court in Nakuru under the then Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act whose section 62(1) used the word “may” as it is in section 25(1) of the Act under consideration in instant appeal. Section 62(1) provided as follows:-“Where any person suffers any bodily injury or is killed by any animal, the person injured or in the case of a deceased person, any other person who was dependant upon him at the date of his death may make application to a district committee established by this section, for the award of compensation for the injury or death.”The respondent denied the claim and contended that the court had no jurisdiction as there was a procedure under section 62(1) which needed to be exhausted. The appellant contended, that the court was properly seized of the matter. The magistrate’s court found that it had no jurisdiction and dismissed the appellant’s suit. The appellant filed an appeal in    the High Court which found that there was a process laid down for compensation under the Act, the process was quick and less bureaucratic, and that the appellant was in abuse of process by pursuing the claim under the Act and also going to the court. On appeal to this Court, the learned Judges agreed with the High Court. The Judges’ decisions in The Speaker of the National Assembly -vs- Karume (supra) and Kimani Wanyoike -vs- Electoral Commission, Civil Appeal No. 213 of 1995 (UR), that held that where there is a specific procedure as to redress of grievance, the same ought to be strictly followed.16.On the use of the word “may” in the section 62(1), this Court stated as follows:-“15.The true construction therefore lies in the context. Ordinarily the word ""may"" is permissive and not mandatory but the contextual meaning would vary with the intention of the drafters. In this case, the argument is not so much the meaning of the word but the effect of it; whether it ousts the jurisdiction of the court. The High Court found, correctly in our view, that the decision of the district committee was amenable to challenge by way of Judicial Review and therefore in that sense the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted. Nevertheless, and again we agree, there was compulsion to exhaust the procedure provided under the section before going to court. To that extent therefore, whereas the appellant was under no compulsion to make any claim, once he chose to do so, as he might, he was compelled to lodge it at the appointed forum, being the District Committee.17.The Supreme Court in the case of NGO’s Coordination Board    -vs- E.G. & 4 Others; Katiba Institute (Amicus Curiae) (Petition No. 16 of 2019) [2023] KESC 17 (KLR) observed that the exhaustion of administrative remedies aids in protecting administrative autonomy, preserving the separation of powers, gaining judicial economy, avoiding administrative inefficiency, and permitting courts to benefit from own administrative body’s determination of facts and exercise of discretion. In Albert Chaurembo Mumba & 7 Others (sued on their own behalf and on behalf of predecessors and or successors in title in their capacities as the Registered Trustees of Kenya Ports Authority Pensions Scheme) -vs- Maurice Munyao & 148 Others (suing on their own behalf and on behalf of the Plaintiffs and other Members/Beneficiaries of the Kenya Ports Authority Pensions Scheme) S.C. Petition No. 3 of 2016; [2019]eKLR, the Supreme Court stated as follows at paragraph 118:-“…..Even where superior courts had jurisdiction to determine profound questions of law, the first opportunity had to be given to relevant persons, bodies, tribunals of any other quasi-judicial authorities and organs to deal with the dispute as provided for in the relevant parent statute.”18.Both NGO’s Coordination Board case and in Nicholas -vs- Attorney General & 7 Others; National Environmental Complaints Committee & 5 Others (Interested Parties) (Petition No. E007 of 2013[2023] KESC 113 (KLR)), the    Supreme Court emphasized that in exceptional circumstances courts may intervene where the exhaustion requirement would not serve the values enshrined inthe Constitutionand where a party applies to be exempted by the court from proceeding with the internal dispute resolution mechanism. There were no exceptional circumstances in this appeal.19.From the record, the respondent made a complaint to the County Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee. There was no evidence given as to what became of the complaint, whether the respondent pursued it or abandoned it. If there was delay on the part of the Committee in dealing with the claim, there was no effort to force it to act by way of Judicial Review. In our considered view, the intention of the framers of section 25 of the Act was to cause claimants who had been injured, or those persons whose relatives had died, by actions of wildlife, to benefit from the dispute resolution mechanism under the Act; a mechanism that was less cumbersome and which would benefit from the specialized knowledge on matters human wildlife interaction. The respondent, instead, opted for the court which, quite unfortunately, did not have the original jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute.20.It is for these reasons that we find that the learned Judge fell into error when he dismissed the appellant’s appeal by holding that the Chief Magistrate’s Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim following the snake attack on the minor.We do not agree that the respondent had the option either to lodge the claim in court or go to the County Wildlife Conservation and Management Committee. The claim belonged to the County Wildlife Conservation and Management Committee.21.Consequently, we allow the appeal with costs. There will be an order dismissing the suit with costs.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W. KARANJA…………………………………JUDGE OF APPEALL. KIMARU…………………………………JUDGE OF APPEALA.O.

      [2024] KECA 1126 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Court of Appeal at NyeriCriminal Appeal 4 of 2019J Mohammed, LK Kimaru & AO Muchelule, JJASeptember 6, 2024BetweenJames Mwandiki MurithiAppellantandRepublicRespondent(Being an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Chuka (R.K. Limo, J.) dated 17th October, 2017 In High Court Criminal Case No. 16 of 2015)JudgmentBackground1.The appellant, James Mwandiki Murithi, was charged with two counts    of the offence of causing grievous harm contrary to Section 234 of the    Penal Code. The particulars of the offence were that on 25thDecember    2011 at Wiru village, Kianjagi sub-location within Tharaka Nithi    County, the appellant did grievous harm to Florence Kanjira (Count 1)    and Ezekiel John (Count 11). The appellant pleaded not guilty and the    matter was set down for trial whereupon the trial court found him guilty of both counts and sentenced him to life imprisonment in respect to count 1 and suspended sentence in respect to count 11.2.A brief background of the appeal is that both the complainants in this case were the appellant’s grandparents. The prosecution called five (5) witnesses in support of its case. Florence Kajira (PW1) testified that she was the appellant’s grandmother and that he used to stay with her. It    was her testimony that the appellant attacked her on 24thDecember, 2011 by beating her and threatening her husband (PW2) who was the appellant’s grandfather, with a panga when he tried to rescue her from the beating. PW1 further testified that on 25thDecember, 2011, the appellant attacked her again, this time more seriously in that he strangled and beat her until she became unconscious. It was her further  testimony that the appellant claimed that she had stolen his  mobile    phone. It was her further testimony that as a result of the assault by    the appellant, she lost consciousness, which  she regained at Chogoria    Hospital.3.Ezekiel John Njiru (PW2) testified that he was the appellant’s    grandfather. It was his testimony that the appellant attacked both he    and PW1 on 24thDecember, 2011 and that they reported the assault to    the police. It was his further evidence that again on  25thDecember,    2011, the appellant attacked PW1 at night until she became    unconscious. That the appellant then turned on PW2 by  pouring    “changaa” on his eyes thereby blinding him and then proceeded to carry    him (PW2) outside into a maize field, “so as to kill him”. It was PW2’s further testimony that the appellant cut him with a panga three times on the head and pierced his ears and the bridge of his nose and left him unconscious in a maize field. It was his testimony that he regained his consciousness at Chogoria Mission Hospital where he was admitted.4.Gerald Arithi (PW3) testified that on 25thDecember, 2011 as the sub- area of Weru village, two people went and reported to him that two    complainants had been injured. It was his evidence that he proceeded to the home of the two injured people where he found that PW1 had been badly injured on the head and was lying down. It was his further testimony that PW2 was also badly injured and had cuts on his face, head and ear. PW3 further testified that PW1 and PW2 were unable to talk and that he and others took them to the hospital where they  were     both admitted. Further, that they also reported the incident to the police    station at Chogoria whereupon the appellant was arrested on the same    day.5.Hillary Kangichu (PW4) was a Clinical Officer from Chuka District    Hospital. It was his evidence that by the time PW1 arrived at the hospital    she was unconscious. That she presented a history of having been    assaulted by someone known to her on 25thDecember, 2011. It was his    testimony that she had blunt head trauma and was unconscious for 10    days by the time he filled the P3 form and that she had right side body    weakness. Further, her thorax and abdomen had multiple soft injuries    and her upper limbs also had multiple blunt soft tissue injuries. There    was also weakness of the right lower limb. In his opinion, the probable weapon used was blunt. PW4 testified that he classified the injuries as grievous harm and filled and produced the P3 form.6.It was PW4’s further evidence that a person known to PW2 assaulted him, and by the time he arrived at the hospital he was unconscious. It was PW4’s testimony that PW2 had multiple scalp wounds on his head and neck. That he had a cut on the right small finger and a proximal    phalanx fracture. PW4 testified that the probable weapon used was a sharp object. He classified the injures as grievous harm and proceeded to sign and produce the P3 form.7.Emmanuel Serem (PW5) was the Investigations Officer. It was his evidence that he commenced investigations on 24thDecember, 2011 when PW1 reported the offence at the police station, which he booked.It was his evidence that on 25thDecember, 2011 the appellant attacked    PW1 and PW2 and that they sustained serious injuries. He issued PW1    and PW2 with P3 forms and recorded witness statements. It was his    further evidence that he established that PW1 was admitted in hospital    for 1 month while PW2 was admitted for two weeks. It was his evidence    that he charged the appellant with the offences.8.When placed on his defence, the appellant gave unsworn evidence and    did not call any witness. The appellant raised an alibi defence stating    that he had been in police custody from 21stDecember, 2011. He denied    being at the scene of the crime on 25thDecember, 2011 as he was still    being held in police custody. In cross-examination he admitted that PW1    and PW2 were his grandmother and grandfather respectively but denied attacking and injuring them.9.Upon analysis of all the evidence, the trial court convicted the appellant of both counts of causing grievous harm.10.The prosecution stated as follows before the appellant was sentenced:“…the accused’s aim was to kill the two. One of the complainants is in court and is walking on crashes (sic) as a result of the attack. The grandfather also has turned blind and sustained spinal injuries and cannot      walk. I produce some medical evidence though we don’t have previous record.”11.Prior to sentencing the appellant, the trial court stated as follows:“I note the seriousness of the offence. I also note the way the accused person attacked the two complainants, who are his grandparents mercilessly and brutally. If the accused was to be given a non-custodial sentence, I am not even guaranteed that the two complainants will live. I therefore find that a different action is most necessary under this circumstance. I also take into account that the permanent injuries and agony the two complainants will have to undergo for the rest of their lives. It is for this reason that I do direct the accused person to serve life sentence in count I. Sentence for count II would be life sentence which is hereby suspended due to the confence (sic) in count I.”12.Dissatisfied by the conviction and sentence, the appellant filed an    appeal to the High Court at Chuka. The High Court (R.K. Limo, J.) found    that  there  was  overwhelming  evidence  against  the  appellant  and    dismissed the appeal on both conviction and sentence. The learned    Judge found as follows:“This court finds that the learned trial magistrate in meting out the life sentence took into account all the relevant factors he ought to have been considered. I am not persuaded that the trial court was influenced by external factors or extraneous matters. I have considered what the appellant said in mitigation and in my view, he did not show any remorsefulness for the agony he caused to his grandparents who had been taking care of him. I did at the hearing of this appeal put questions to the appellant albeit off the record to see if he had changed his stand but he appeared defiant showing no remorse at all. He infact denounced them that they were not his grandparents despite evidence to the contrary tendered at the trial. So in situations where an accused person has been convicted and show (sic) no remorsefulness about the offence he is charged with, a court cannot be faulted for handing a maximum      sentence provided by law. That situation obtains in this case and on the basis of that I do not find any reason to interfere with the trial court's discretion to hand life sentence to the appellant. The complainants who are grandparents to the appellant are certainly safer without him and that played in the mind of the learned trial magistrate when sentencing the appellant.In the premises, I find no merit in this appeal. I find no option but to uphold both the conviction and the sentence meted out against the appellant. The appeal is therefore dismissed.”13.Undeterred, the appellant filed an appeal to this Court raising the    following grounds of appeal to wit that the learned Judge erred in  law:    by failing to note that the prosecution case was not proved beyond    reasonable doubt as required by law; by failing to note that the evidence    was inconsistent, contradictory and not corroborated; and by convicting    the appellant to life imprisonment hence failed to note that there was    no independent witness called to clear doubt. The appellant urged that    the appeal succeeds, conviction quashed, sentence set aside and he be    set at liberty.Submissions14.At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was acting in person. Ms.  Nandwa, the learned Prosecution Counsel was on record for the State.15.The appellant submitted that his appeal is only against sentence. He abandoned his appeal against conviction. He urged this Court to consider the time that he has spent in remand custody.16.Ms. Nandwa submitted that the sentence imposed by the trial court and upheld by the 1stappellate court was lawful. Counsel submitted that the sentence of life imprisonment was proper and well within the law    considering the manner in which PW1 and PW2 were brutally attacked and left for dead by the appellant. Counsel emphasized that PW1 was in a coma for a period of 10 days and was admitted in hospital for one month due to the injuries that she sustained from the assault by the appellant. Counsel further emphasized that PW1 began using crutches as a result of the attack. Counsel submitted that on the other hand,     PW2 became blind after the appellant poured changaa into his eyes.Counsel stressed that the injuries caused by the appellant upon PW1    and PW2 are permanent in nature and the same have caused agony in    their lives.17.Counsel further stressed that the appellant was extremely brutal when    he attacked PW1 and PW2. In counsel’s opinion, the appellant was    merciless in his attack and was never at any one point provoked by PW1    and PW2. Counsel emphasized that there was no reason at all for the    appellant to attack PW1 and PW2 who had taken care of him most of    his life. Counsel highlighted that in mitigation, the appellant was not    remorseful of the pain and suffering that he had caused his    grandparents. Counsel stressed that if the appellant were to be given a non-custodial sentence or probation he may have gone back to further harm his grandparents, which in her view is the reason that he was sentenced to life imprisonment. In counsel’s opinion, the life sentence imposed on the appellant also served the purpose of re-assuring PW1 and PW2 that they would be safer without him.18.Counsel urged this Court to find that in the circumstances, the sentence of life imprisonment was not at all harsh and excessive but was proper, taking into consideration a number of factors such as: the gravity of the offence; that the degree of harm was grievous; that the victims were two and were both elderly; that the appellant used a sharp weapon when he attacked the victims; and that the offence is prevalent in the community.19.In conclusion, counsel submitted that the prosecution proved its case    beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant for the offence of causing    grievous harm which he was found guilty of and convicted accordingly.Counsel reiterated that the prosecution evidence was clear, concise and    consistent and urged this Court to uphold the sentence of life    imprisonment.Determination20.We have considered the record of appeal, the submissions, the    authorities cited and the law.  This is a second appeal and as such we    are limited to consideration of matters of law only. Accordingly, we are    generally bound by concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below    departing therefrom only in the rarest of cases where they are not based on any evidence or proceed from a misapprehension of the evidence or are plainly untenable. See Karingo v Republic [1982] KLR 219 and  Section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code.21.We have been urged to interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial court, which was upheld by the 1stappellate court. The appellant was    charged with two counts for the offence of grievous harm contrary to    Section 234 of the Penal Code which provides as follows:“Any person who unlawfully does grievous harm to another      is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life.”22.Grievous harm is defined under Section 4 of the Penal Code to mean:‘any harm which amounts to a maim or dangerous harm or seriously or permanently injures health, or which is likely to injure health or which extends to permanent disfigurement, or to any permanent or serious injury to any external or internal organ, membrane or sense.”23.In Pius Mutua Mbuvi v Republic [2021] eKLR the High Court stated    that from the definition of grievous harm under Section 4 of the Penal    Code the ingredients of the offence of grievous harm are:“1)Victim sustained grievous arm2.Harm was caused unlawfully3.Accused caused/participated in causing the grievous harm.”Further, the same court went on to state the specificities of grievous harm    as follows:“In the case of grievous harm, the injury to health must be permanent or likely to be permanent, whereas, to amount to bodily harm, the injury to health need not be permanent(2)a mental injury may amount to grievous harm but not to bodily harm (3) the injury must be ‘of such a nature as to cause or be likely to cause’ permanent injury to health.”24.The maximum sentence for an accused person found guilty of the offence of causing grievous harm is, therefore, life imprisonment. The trial court stated as follows:“It is clear from the testimony on record that the accused brutally attacked the two complainants who are his grandparents, he attacked them mercilessly, infact from the nature of the attack and injuries suffered by the two, the intention of the accused was probably to kill them, and it is by God’s grace that the two survived.”In so finding, the trial court imposed the sentence of life imprisonment. The 1stappellate court upheld the sentence.25.Can we, as the 2ndappellate court in the circumstances interfere with    the sentence upheld by the 1stappellate court? This Court in in Bernard    Kimani Gacheru V Republic [2002] eKLR stated as follows:-“It is now settled law, following several authorities by this Court and by the High Court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that the trial court overlooked some material factor, or took into account some wrong material, or acted on a wrong principle. Even if, the Appellate Court feels that the sentence is heavy and that the Appellate Court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone      of the matters already states is shown to exist.”26.In the circumstances, for us to interfere with the sentence upheld by the 1stappellate court, we must be satisfied that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case; the 1stappellate court overlooked some material factors, took into account some wrong material or acted on wrong material, or acted on a wrong principle of law.27.In considering whether to interfere with the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the trial court, the 1stappellate court stated as follows:“The denial by the accused that he attacked the two, and his allegation that on 25thDecember, 2011 he was in police custody is a total lie. It is clear from the testimony on record that the accused brutally attacked the two complainants who are his grandparents, he attacked them mercilessly, infact, from the nature of the attack and injuries suffered by the two, the intention of the accused was probably to kill them, and it is by God’s grace that the two survived.Medical evidence on record shows that the two were taken to hospital unconscious as a result of the attack, the first complainant was in a comma for ten days.The clinical officer classified the injuries suffered by the two as grievous harm, he produced the two P3 forms. For these reasons stated here above, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did grievous harm to the two and I find him guilty in both counts as charged.Criminal Procedure Code.”His defence is a sham, full of lies and I dismiss the same, and for the reasons I have stated herein-above, do convict him in the two counts as charged under Section 21528.In the circumstances, we find that the 1stappellate court took into  account proper considerations when upholding the sentence of life imprisonment. We find that the 1stappellate court made no misdirection in upholding the sentence imposed by the trial court29.The appellant brutally assaulted his elderly grandparents who both sustained serious and life-changing injuries which include causing physical impairment to PW1 who has to use crutches to aid in her mobility and blindness to PW2. We find that the sentence imposed by    the trial court and upheld by the 1stappellate court was lawful and was neither harsh nor manifestly excessive. The appellant does not deserve clemency from us. Accordingly, we have no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed on the appellant and upheld by the 1stappellate court.30.The upshot is that this appeal against sentence has no merit and it is hereby dismissed.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 6THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.JAMILA MOHAMMED……………………………..JUDGE OF APPEALL.

W. Kagendo Chief Magistrate given on 3/8/2018 in Nyeri CMCC 874 of 2006.2.The matter was filed on 6/12/2006. The mater never took off on 18/6/2009 the Plaintiff sought to transfer the matter to the High Court. He was given but the matter did not proceed for one reason or another on 19/5/2011 the Court was informed that the Plaintiff died on 29/1/2011. The plaintiff was given a last adjournment on 18/8/2011 for a full year the issue of substitution was dwelled on.3.In 2017 there was an indication that there was no longer a moratorium against Invesco. A date was taken for 24/5/2015. On the next hearing date there was another indication that the mater involved United Insurance. Other dates were taken. Later after adjournments Defendant indicated that they had sought instruction in vain. The matter was placed aside. The court dismissed the suit with costs to the Respondent herein.4.On 25/6/2018 barely a week later an application was filed. The court delivered its Ruling on 3/8/18. This is the ruling subject to of this Appeal.5.The Appellant filed a 3 paragraph memorandum of Appeal: -a.That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in distending the appellant’s evidence completely and therefore arriving at the wrong conclusion. A gross misjustice was therefore occasioned.b.That the ruling of the learned magistrate was in complete disregard of the weight of the evidence adduced by the appellant.c.That the learned magistrate clearly misdirected herself in law thus causing gross injustice to the appellant.6.This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and make its own conclusions. It must, however, keep at the back of its mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand.7.This was aptly stated in the case of Peters vs Sunday Post Limited [1958] EA 424 where, the court of Appeal therein rendered itself as follows:-“It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the findings on a question of fact, of the judge who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses…But the jurisdiction to review the evidence should be exercised with caution: it is not enough that the appellate court might have come to a different conclusion…”8.In Selle & Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123, this principle was enunciated thus:“...this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court ... is by way of re-trial and the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow the trial Court’s finding of fact if it appears either that he failed to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities or if the impression of demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence generally.”9.This being a first Appeal, I need to add that this is an appeal from exercise of discretion of the lower court. It does not matter that had I been sitting in that court, I could have reached a different conclusion. The question to lacks is whether the court fettered its discretion by;a.Taking into consideration irrelevant factors.b.Ignored relevant factors.c.Was pliantly wrong.10.The Application dated 22/6/2018 was made under order 12 Rule 7 which provides as follows:-‘Where under this Order judgment has been entered or the suit has been dismissed, the court, on application, may set aside or vary the judgment or order upon such terms as may be just.’11.The main ground was that the appellant attended court on 6/3/2018 and was informed that that the court was not sitting. That the date was to be fixed but he was not informed. However, the suit was subsequently dismissed. It was their case that the suit ought not to have been dismissed.12.The nature of the application is of the Review. The decision to dismiss was made on 25/6/2018. No new facts were paced before the court to show that status had changed. Review in a sense of the word is the same for this Application and under order 45 and section 80 of theCivil Procedure Act.13.Section 80 of theCivil Procedure Actstates that:“Any person who considers himself aggrieved—(a)by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or(b)by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit”.Section 63 (e) of theCivil Procedure Actstates that:“In order to prevent the ends of justice from being defeated, the court may, if it is so prescribed make such other interlocutory orders as may appear to the court to be just and convenient12.Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides for Review and it states as follows:“(1)Any person considering himself aggrieved—(a)by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or(b)by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.(2)A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when, being respondent, he can present to the appellate court the case on which he applies for the review”12.I associate myself with the reasoning of Kuloba J (as he then was) in Lakesteel Supplies vs. Dr. Badia and Anor Kisumu HCCC No. 191 of 1994 where he opined that:“The exercise of review entails a judicial re-examination, that is to say, a reconsideration, and a second view or examination, and a consideration for purposes of correction of a decree or order on a former occasion. And one procures such examination and correction, alteration or reversal of a former position for any of the reasons set out above. The court of review has only a limited jurisdiction circumscribed by the definitive limits fixed by the language used in Order 44 rule 1, of the Civil Procedure Rules. A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only for patent error. It can only lie if one of the grounds is shown, one cannot elaborately go into evidence again and then reverse the decree or order as that would be acting without jurisdiction, and to be sitting in appeal. The object is not to enable a judge to rewrite a second judgement or ruling because the first one is wrong…On an application for review, the court is to see whether any evident error or omission needs correction or is otherwise a requisite for ends of justice. The power, which inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction, is exercised to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors. It is a discretionary power. In the present application it has not been said or even suggested that after the passing of the order sought to be reviewed, there is a discovery of new and important matter of evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the applicant’s knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the ruling was made.”14.The two grounds given are hyperbolic and self-destructing. It is either the suit was stayed or the Appellant did not attend court. It behooves parties to follow up their maters.15.I do not find any error in the decision of the court. The amount and nature of excuses given for an entire decade is mind boggling. The court was correct in saving the matter from the ignominy of its lack of prosecution. In the case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd vs West End Distributors Ltd [1969) EA 696 the court stated as follows: -“In cases falling outside the specific provisions quoted above. Farrel, J., adopted this view. Dalton, J., in Saldanha’s case purported to follow the decision of Windham m C.J. in Mulji v Jadavji, [ 1963] EA. 217, but all that case decided was that the courts inherent jurisdiction could not be invoked where an l alternative remedy had been available. In the instant case, it is clear that none of the specific provisions for dismissing suits applied to the suit the subject of this appeal. That being so, I do not see how the courts inherent jurisdiction can be said to be fettered, as no alternative remedy existed.”16.Consequently, the Appeal is not merited. The same is dismissed with costs. Section 27 of theCivil Procedure Actprovides as follows in regard to costs.“(1)Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, and to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, the costs of and incidental to all suits shall be in the discretion of the court or judge, and the court or judge shall have full power to determine by whom and out of what property and to what extent such costs are to be paid, and to give all necessary directions for the purposes aforesaid; and the fact that the court or judge has no jurisdiction to try the suit shall be no bar to the exercise of those powers: Provided that the costs of any action, cause or other matter or issue shall follow the event unless the court or judge shall for good reason otherwise order.(2)The court or judge may give interest on costs at any rate not exceeding fourteen per cent per annum, and such interest shall be added to the costs and shall be recoverable as such.”17.The Supreme Court set forth guiding principles applicable in the exercise of that discretion in the case of Jasbir SinghRai & 3 others v. Tarlochan Singh Rai & 4 others, SC Petition No. 4 of 2012; [2014] eKLR, as follows: -“(18)It emerges that the award of costs would normally be guided by the principle that “costs follow the event”: the effect being that the party who calls forth the event by instituting suit, will bear the costs if the suit fails; but if this party shows legitimate occasion, by successful suit, then the defendant or respondent will bear the costs. However, the vital factor in setting the preference is the judiciously-exercised discretion of the Court, accommodating the special circumstances of the case, while being guided by ends of justice. The claims of the public interest will be a relevant factor, in the exercise of such discretion, as will also be the motivations and conduct of the parties, before, during, and subsequent to the actual process of litigation…. Although there is eminent good sense in the basic rule of costs– that costs follow the event – it is not an invariable rule and, indeed, the ultimate factor on award or non-award of costs is the judicial discretion. It follows, therefore, that costs do not, in law, constitute an unchanging consequence of legal proceedings – a position well illustrated by the considered opinions of this Court in other cases.18.Costs follow the event. The event in this case is the dismissal of the Appeal. Accordingly, I dismiss the Appeal with cost of 65,000/=. The file is closed.Determination19.The upshot of the foregoing is that I make the following orders: -a.The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed with costs of 65,000/= payable within 30 days, in default execution do issue.b.The file is closed.DELIVERED, DATED AND SIGNED AT MOMBASA ON THIS 14THDAY OF MAY, 2024.

The Respondent complied by filing its affidavit sworn on 12.6.2024.2.I have perused the lease agreement between the parties and I do note that the same provides for a lease period of six (6) years which is well outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.3.A controlled tenancy under Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya means a tenancy of a shop, hotel or catering establishment;a.Which has not been reduced into writing orb.Which has been reduced into writing and whichi.Is for a period not exceeding five (5) years orii.Contains provisions for termination otherwise than for breach of contract within five (5) years from the commencement thereof oriii.Relates to premises of a class specified under subsection (2) of this Act.4.From the above definition, it is therefore clear that the tenancy between the 2ndApplicant and the Respondent does not amount to a controlled tenancy and the Tribunal therefore lacks the jurisdiction to hear and determine this dispute.5.I do note from the record that on 2.5.2024 the 1stTenant/Applicant withdrew her complaint against the Respondent.

DW Mburu, Principal Magistrate, PM, delivered on 30th July 2021, in Nairobi CMCCC No. 5042 of 2019)Judgment1.The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the respondent, against the appellants, for compensation, arising from a motor vehicle accident, which allegedly happened on 15thJune 2018, within Umoja II Estate, Nairobi, involving the minor respondent and motor vehicle registration mark and number KBP 280U, which was allegedly owned or controlled by the appellants at the material time. The minor respondent was allegedly outside his house, when the vehicle was allegedly negligently driven, and knocked him down, wherein he sustained injury. The appellants filed a defence, in which they denied everything pleaded in the plaint. In the alternative, they attributed negligence on the minor respondent and his guardian.2.Liability was settled, vide a consent that was recorded between the parties, on 10thMarch 2021, at 80:20, in favour of the respondent, and against the appellants. The parties agreed, on 28thMay 2021, to have the court aasess quantum based on agreed documents and written submissions. Judgment was delivered on 30thJuly 2021, where general damages were awarded at Kshs. 800,000.00, subject to contribution, while special damages were assessed at Kshs. 102,058.00, with costs.3.The appellants were aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 27thAugust 2021, largely turn on the quantum of the damages awarded being excessive.4.Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were given on 31stJuly 2023, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. Both sides have filed written submissions.5.The appellants have submitted that the quantum of general damages, assessed by the trial court, was inordinately excessive, and the decisions, in TAM (a minor suing through her father and next friend JOM) vs. Richard Kirimi Kinoti & another [2015] eKLR (Njuguna, J), Akamba Public Road Services vs. Abdikadir Adan Galgalo [2016] eKLR (J. Kamau, J) and Jackson Mbaluka Mwangangi vs. Onesmus Nzioka & another [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J). The respondent wholly supports the award by the trial court, and relies on Reuben Mongare Keba vs. LPN [2016] eKLR (Okwany, J) and EWO (suing as a friend and minor COW) vs. Chair Board of Governors Agoro Yombe Secondary School  [2018] eKLR (Aburili, J).6.The appeal turns only on assessment of general damages.7.The injuries sustained by the minor respondent were not particularised in the plaint, as it was merely pleaded that he had sustained multiple injuries, including a fractured bone on the right leg. The respondent, however, filed a number of medical records, where the injuries were noted. The P3 form, dated 3rdAugust 2018, recorded a fracture of the midshaft of the right femur. The injury was similarly recorded in the case summary from Kenyatta National Hospital, dated 31stJuly 2018. There is no other record, of a medical nature, in the original trial record file, and although the parties agreed to canvass the quantum by way of written submissions, based on agreed documents, the relevant record of the trial court did not record the documents that were put in evidence for that purpose. In the judgment, the trial court relied on a medico-legal report, by a Dr TS Mogire, dated 21stAugust 2020, but it is not documented how the trial court came to have access to that report, as there is no such report, filed in the trial record, and no such report was produced, as there was no formal trial, by way of an oral hearing. Although the appellant mentions, in his written submissions, another medico-legal report, by a Dr Wambugu, I have been unable to find a copy of it in the trial record, and I have noted that the trial court did not refer to any such report in the judgment, neither is it mentioned in the trial notes.8.There are glaring gaps in the trial record, relating to the material that the trial court relied on in its judgment to assess the damages, but since the appellants do not raise issue with it, I shall go by what the court relied on, the medico-legal report by Dr. TS Mogire. As I have indicated hereabove, and in my ruling of 25thJune 2024, that report is not in the original trial court record, and it was not referred to in the proceedings, and it first appears in the judgment. It has been placed before me, through a supplementary record of appeal, filed herein on 3rdJuly 2024. It is dated 21stAugust 2020, and documents the injury sustained by the minor, as a right thigh injury, with a fractured femur, and head bruises. It notes a shortening of the affected leg by 2.5 centimetres, and permanent disability is assessed at 4%.9.It would appear that this was a case of a fracture of the right femur, without complications, except for the shortening of the leg by 2.5 centimetres. There were also minor or superficial soft tissue injuries.10.In its assessment of damages, the trial court did not indicate the decided cases from which it was guided, except for citing the decisions that the respondent relied on, that is to say Jackline Kamunyu vs. Simion Kiiru Njoki [2018] eKLR, which I have been unable to access from the Kenya Law search engine, and Edward Kamau & James Karanja vs, Hannah Mukui Gichuki & Gestether [2018] eKLR (Sergon, J), which involved fractures of the femur.11.I have looked at the authorities cited by the appellants. In TAM (a minor suing through her father and next friend JOM) vs. Richard Kirimi Kinoti & another [2015] eKLR (Njuguna, J), the claimant had sustained a fracture of the left femur, and the court awarded Kshs. 250,000.00. In Akamba Public Road Services vs. Abdikadir Adan Galgalo [2016] eKLR (J. Kamau, J), the injuries were a fracture of the right tibia leg malleolus and right fibular bone, with a blunt injury to the ankles, and Kshs. 500,000.00 was awarded. In Jackson Mbaluka Mwangangi vs. Onesmus Nzioka & another [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J), the claimant suffered a fracture of the left femur, with blunt injury to the right shoulder, and Kshs. 600,000.00 was awarded.12.Only 2 of these authorities is relevant, that is to say TAM (a minor suing through her father and next friend JOM) vs. Richard Kirimi Kinoti & another [2015] eKLR (Njuguna, J) and Jackson Mbaluka Mwangangi vs. Onesmus Nzioka & another [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J), to the extent that they involved fractures of the femur. Akamba Public Road Services vs. Abdikadir Adan Galgalo [2016] eKLR (J. Kamau, J) was about the bones of the tibia and fibula, and not the femur. TAM (a minor suing through her father and next friend JOM) vs. Richard Kirimi Kinoti & another [2015] eKLR (Njuguna, J) is rather dated, but Jackson Mbaluka Mwangangi vs. Onesmus Nzioka & another [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J) is more recent.13.The respondent has cited Reuben Mongare Keba vs. LPN [2016] eKLR (Okwany, J) and EWO (suing as a friend and minor COW) vs. Chair Board of Governors Agoro Yombe Secondary School  [2018] eKLR (Aburili, J). In Reuben Mongare Keba vs. LPN [2016] eKLR (Okwany, J), the injuries were a fracture of the tibia-fibula bones of the right leg, fracture of the right femur, dislocation of the right hip joint, degloving injury of the right leg, and bruises on the chin, and the award was Kshs. 800,000.00. In EWO (suing as a friend and minor COW) vs. Chair Board of Governors Agoro Yombe Secondary School  [2018] eKLR (Aburili, J), the minor suffered a fracture on the right mid-shaft femur with tibiofibular fracture, and the court awarded Kshs. 800,000.00.14.I doubt that the 2 authorities, cited by the respondent, would be of much assistance, for, although the claimants sustained fractures of the femur, the same were in addition to fractures of the tibia and fibula bones, and, therefore, the injuries were a lot more serious, than what the respondent in the instant case suffered. They are also fairly dated.15.I have done a survey of recent decisions, where the claimant had sustained a midshaft fracture of the femur, and preferably of the right leg, for comparative purposes, to guide in assessing whether the trial court properly assessed the damages awardable. I have surveyed first cases of a simple fracture of the midshaft of the femur, followed by cases where the facture was accompanied by other relatively serious injuries.16.In Kiran Kumar Somchand Shah vs. Isaac Kimathi Kaai [2021] eKLR (Cherere, J), the claimant had sustained a midshaft fracture, but it was not indicated if it was of the femur, but Kshs. 550,000.00 was awarded. In FKM (suing as the next friend and mother of DK – Minor) vs. Security Group Cash in Transit Limited & 2 others [2023] KEHC 11764 (KLR)(Limo, J), the injury was a fracture of the midshaft femur, and Kshs. 300,000.00 was awarded.17.In Kimani vs. Mwangi & 2 others [2024] KEHC 6744 (KLR)(Nzioka, J), the midshaft fracture of the femur of the right leg was accompanied by a cut wound on the left leg, and the court awarded Kshs. 550,000.00. In Kihara & another vs. Mutuku [2022] eKLR (Mwongo, J), the fracture of the right femur, was in addition to blunt injuries to the chest and left thigh and bruises on the forearms, and an award of Kshs. 700,000.00 was made. Kshs. 800,000.00 was awarded, in Kiautha vs. Ntaragwi [2022] KEHC 10595 (KLR) (Muriithi, J), for a midshaft femur fracture, with bruises on the upper arm and the right shoulder, tender upper back, bruised left foot and a tender and swollen right thigh. In Transbionics Limited vs. Micheni [2023] KEHC 18332 (KLR)(Njuguna, J), the accompanying injuries to the fracture of the right femur midshaft were a lot more serious, being extensive degloving injury of the right thigh, contusion of the left elbow joint and knee joint, chest contusion and multiple laceration on the forehead, and an award of Kshs. 1,200,000.00 was made.18.The above review does not leave me any wiser, for it displays a fairly wide variation in assessment of damages for this class of injury. I am alive to the fact that assessment of damages is at the discretion of the court. Some of the more recent decisions, such as Jackson Mbaluka Mwangangi vs. Onesmus Nzioka & another [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J), Kihara & another vs. Mutuku [2022] eKLR (Mwongo, J) and Kiautha vs. Ntaragwi [2022] KEHC 10595 (KLR) (Muriithi, J), are closer to the injuries sustained by the minor respondent herein. I am disinclined to interfere with the assessment made by the trial court, and I am inclined to find that the award made was within range, and the trial court did not apply a wrong principle.19.Perhaps the final word should be with respect to the crucial importance of the trial record. I mention this because of the gaps that I have seen in this matter, in the manner in which the trial proceedings were recorded, and documents received. Trial courts are courts of record, in the sense that it is their record which is permanent, for, should their decisions be challenged, by way of appeal, the appellate courts would not conduct fresh hearings, but would rely exclusively on the record generated by the trial court. If the trial court does not do a good job, of properly and scrupulously recording what transpires before it, inclusive of the documents that it receives in evidence, the appellate court would be handicapped, with the result that it may not do justice to the matter as a consequence.20.I am persuaded that there is no merit in the instant appeal, for reasons that should be clear, from the body of the judgment. I hereby, therefore, dismiss the same. There shall be no order on costs.DELIVERED BY EMAIL, DATED AND SIGNED IN CHAMBERS, AT BUSIA,THIS 4thDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W MUSYOKAJUDGEMs. Veronica, Court Assistant, Milimani, Nairobi.Mr. Arthur Etyang, Court Assistant.ADVOCATESMr. Ombati, instructed by Ombati Ong’au & Company, Advocates for the appellants.Ms. Muriuki, instructed by Mutai Maina Kimeu & Company, Advocates for the respondent.",Onderi & another v ESO (Aminor through next friend and father John Tabu Owade) (Civil Appeal E538 of 2021) [2024] KEHC 10551 (KLR) (4 September 2024) (Judgment),Civil Appeal E538 of 2021,"WM Musyoka, J","September 4, 2024",

Rading Senior Resident Magistrate (SRM) delivered on 15th September 2022 in Nairobi CMCC No. E313 of 2021))Judgment1.This is an Appeal from the decision of the court in Chief Magistrate’s court civil case No. E313 of 2021 in which the Respondent sued the Appellant seeking damages for injuries suffered by the minor in a road traffic accident which occurred on 21stNovember 2020 along Kiambu-Banana Road involving motor vehicle registration No. KCF 200M.2.The learned trial court by its judgment dated 15thSeptember 2022, issued the following awards in favour of the Respondent which has now triggered this appeal; -a.General damages at Kshs. 2,000,000/- minus the 20% agreed liability (net being Kshs. 1,600,000)b.Special damages of Kshs. 23,650/-c.Costsd.Interest on (a) from the date of delivery of the Judgment and on (b) from the date filing the suit.The Appeal3.Vide memorandum of appeal dated 14thOctober 2022, the Appellant appealed against the decision of the trial court on the following grounds; -i.That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding general damages that was excessive in the circumstances.ii.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding general damagesiii.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff could not have warranted an award of Kshs. 2,000,000/-iv.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the authorities cited by the defendant/appellant.4.The grounds of appeal as enumerated above largely speaks to two things. First, that the award of general damages was excessive and was not in tandem with the injuries suffered by the Respondent. That the magistrate proceeded on wrong principles in awarding Kshs. 2,000,000 in general damages.Submissions5.The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The Appellant’s submissions are dated 27thOctober 2023 while the Respondent’s submissions are dated 21stAugust 2023.6.The Appellant challenged the award of Kshs. 2,000,000/- in general damages as excessive on the basis that the same was not in tandem with the injuries suffered by the Respondent. Relying on the two medical reports, one by Dr. G.K. Mwaura and the other by Dr. Ashwin Madhiwalla dated 3rdApril 2021 and 2ndDecember 2021 respectively, enumerated the salient injuries suffered by the Respondent as a result of the accident. According to the Appellant, those injuries were minor and did not in any way warrant the award of Kshs. 2,000,000/- in general damages as issued by the trial magistrate.7.The Appellant argued and proposed that in the circumstances of the case and taking into account the injuries suffred by the Respondent an award not exceeding a sum of Kshs. 1,000,000/- would be reasonable.8.On the other hand, the Respondent in their submissions maintained that the award by the trial court was reasonable and justifiable in the circumstances of the case. Relying on the two authorities cited in their submissions, the Respondent urged this court to uphold the award.Analysis and determination9.This appeal is limited to the measure of quantum of damages awarded by the trial court. A consent on liability had been recorded at the trial stage in the ratio of 80:20 in favour of the Respondent in this Appeal.10.Since this is an appeal on quantum of damages, this court will be guided by the principal that the assessment of damages is within the discretion of the trial court and that an appellate court should only interfere in instances where trial court, in assessing damages, erred in principle and either took into account an irrelevant factor or left out a relevant factor or that the award was too high or too low as to amount to an erroneous estimate or that the assessment is based on no evidence (see Mbogo vs Shah (1968) EA 93 and Kemfro Africa Ltd t/a Meru Express & Another v A. M. Lubia and Another [1982-88] 1 KAR 727),11.At the same time, I will also bear in mind the fact that this being a first appeal, this appeal will be way of retrial and this court is to reconsider evidence tendered at the trial court, reevaluate the same and draw its own conclusions, noting that I did not have the advantage of seeing and hearing the witness testify as was held in the case of Selle & Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd & Others [1968] EA where the court stated that:“...this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court ... is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect...""12.Having the two principles in mind, I shall now proceed and re-valuate the nature of the injuries suffered by the Respondent as pleaded and proved in evidence and draw my own conclusion, as an appellate court, as to whether the learned trial magistrate exercised his discretion judiciously in assessing the general damages in the circumstances of the case.13.From the parties’ respective submissions, it is apparent that the parties are in agreement on the nature of the injuries suffered by the Respondent as a result of the accident. Their only point of departure is the quantum of damages that would be reasonable to compensate the injuries.14.Both the Appellant and the Respondent agree that the Respondent suffered the following injuries; -a.Fracture of the left tibia- fibulab.Compound Fracture of left malleolusc.Mild head injuryd.Fracture of the occipital bonee.cerebral oedemaf.Right ear otorrhea15.As stated above, the duty of this court is primarily to re-evaluate the evidence of the injuries suffered and assess whether or not the quantum on general damages as awarded by the trial court was in tandem with the injuries suffered by the minor and therefore reasonable in the circumstances.16.The Appellant argued that a sum not exceeding Kshs. 1,000,000/- would be reasonable. He placed reliance on Regina Mpinda V Reuben Muthiora Johny [2022] eKLR where general damages were reduced from Kshs. 3,000,000- to Kshs. 1,000,000/- for oblique fracture on mid third ulna, nerve injury, wounds on both knees and 100% loss of function of the right upper limb.17.The Appellant also cited the case of Kimathi Muturi Donald V Kevin Ochieng Aseso [2021] eKLR where general damages were reduced from Kshs. 1,500,000/- to Kshs. 1,200,00 for a fracture of the upper right tibia, a fracture of the floor of the socket of the left hip joint (acetabulum) and 20% disability for both legs.18.The Respondent in urging the court not to disturb the award of Kshs. 2,000,000/- for the injuries suffered cited the case of Zachary Kariithi vs Joshon Otieno Ochola [2016] eKLR where an award of Kshs. 1,500,000/- was made for compound fracture of the right tibia/fibula, compound fracture of the left femur bone mid shaft, fracture of the right femur bone and fracture of the 3rd, 4th5thribs of the right side.19.The respondent argued that taking into account the inflation, the appropriate sum in damages for injuries are these ought to be Kshs. 2,000,000/- as was awarded by the learned trial magistrate.20.In awarding general damages, courts ought to give an award that reflects the nature and gravity of the injuries. The principle applicable in the assessment of damages is that comparable injuries should as far as possible, be compensated by comparable awards, always bearing in mind that not two cases are precisely alike. See the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Simon Taveta v Mercy Mutitu Njeru [2014] eKLR.21.I have reviewed the injuries sustained by the Respondent, the parties’ respective submissions together with the authorities cited. In note that the Respondent suffered multiple fractures as a result of the accident which resulted in hospitalization for a period of about one month. I also note that there is also the residual effect, including that of possible loss of hearing on the right ear.22.Taking into account the above injuries and taking into account the decisions cited by the parties, I find that the injuries in the case of Zachary Kariithi vs Joshon Otieno Ochola [2016] eKLR are more comparable to those suffered by the Respondent in the present case.23.Taking into account the time difference and inflation, I will allow 10% adjustment and award a sum of Kshs. 1,650,000/- as opposed to Kshs. 2,000,000/- awarded by the trial court.24.For the reasons I have set out above, I allow the appeal and set aside the award of general damages by the trial court and substitute the same with a sum of Kshs. 1,650,000/-. Allowing the 20% contribution agreed at the trial court (Less 20% agreed liability), the net amount will be Kshs. 1,320,000.25.The sum shall accrue interest from the date of judgment in the lower court.26.The Appellant shall have the costs of this Appeal which is assessed at Kshs. 50,000/-, all inclusive.27.It so ordered.SIGNED DATED and DELIVERED IN VIRTUAL COURT THIS 19THDAY OF JULY 2024ADO MOSESJUDGEMoses – Court AssistantMwangi for the Appellant.N/A for the Respondent.",Muchoki v NN (Suing as the Next Friend of JN - Minor) (Civil Appeal E243civil of 2022) [2024] KEHC 8992 (KLR) (19 July 2024) (Judgment),Civil Appeal E243civil of 2022,"MA Otieno, J","July 19, 2024",

In this regard, I have perused and considered the submissions filed by Kimondo Gachoka & Company Advocates for the applicant, as well as the submissions filed by Njoroge Mwangi & Company Advocates for the respondent.8.I note that the respondent’s counsel submitted that if the application is allowed, then the decretal amount be deposited in a joint interest earning account within 30 days.9.This being an application for stay of execution pending determination of appeal, it is governed by the provisions of Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules.10.In my view, this application was filed without unreasonable delay though it was filed on 29thApril 2024 after appeal was filed on 8thDecember 2023. However, I have to point out that this is a borderline case on delay, and the application was only saved by the fact that appeal was filed in good time.11.As to whether the applicant is likely to suffer substantial loss if the stay orders sought are not granted, in my view, if the entire decretal amount is paid out to the respondent, the applicant might suffer substantial loss because the respondent might not be in a position to repay the amount.12.As for provision of security, the applicant has offered to provide a bank guarantee. However, the respondent has proposed that the entire decretal amount be paid into a joint interest earning bank account in the names of the Advocates. In my view, it is more appropriate herein for the applicants to pay the decretal sum into a joint interest earning saving account.13.Consequently, I allow the application and order as follows:-i.This court grants stay of execution of judgment/decree in Voi CMCC No. E169 of 2022 delivered on 11thSeptember 2023 pending hearing and full determination of Voi HCCA No. E069 of 2023ii.The above stay of execution orders are subject to the condition that the applicant deposits the entire decretal amount Kshs. 242,550/= in a joint interest earning bank account in the names of the counsel for the parties within fourty (40) days from today.iii.The costs of the application will abide the determination of the appeal.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED THIS 17THDAY OF JULY 2024 IN OPEN COURT AT VOI VIRTUALLY.GEORGE DULUJUDGEIn the presence of:-Alfred/Trizah – Court AssistantsMr. Ndolo for the applicantsNo appearance for respondents",Mwangi & another v GUK (minor suing through next friend and Mother MWK) (Civil Appeal E069 of 2023) [2024] KEHC 9028 (KLR) (17 July 2024) (Ruling),Civil Appeal E069 of 2023,"GMA Dulu, J","July 17, 2024",

The child was found abandoned at Kawangware Deliverance Church area on 17 April 2019. The child was rescued and the matter reported to the Muthangari Police Station vide OB No. 26/17/04/2019. Through investigations, the father of the child was found and arrested. He was released on cash bail at the Police Station and disappeared without trace.4.The child was formally committed New Life Trust Home on 15 January 2020. He was declared free for adoption by Buckner Kenya Adoption Services on 3 March 2023 under certificate number 0623. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met. He was placed with the Applicants on 7 July 2023 and has been in their care and control since.The Applicants5.The Applicants are Kenyan citizens, aged 47 years and 48 years, respectively. They have been married for 11 years and reside in Nairobi. The 1st Applicant is employed as a Security Guard, while the 2nd Applicant is a business lady. During their marriage, the Applicants were blessed with one child, who unfortunately, passed away.6.The Applicants presented copies of their Mpesa Statements, Pay slip, Medical Reports and Certificates of Good Conduct as proof that they are financially, emotional and socially capable of handling parental responsibilities and raising the child in a loving, nurturing environment. They confirmed that they fully understood the implications of an Adoption Order and that the same is irreversible.7.The Applicants proposed J.M.N and J.M.M to be the legal guardians of the child. The proposed legal guardians are a couple and had filed their consents dated 8 May 2024. JMM is a sister to the 1st Applicant. They confirmed that they fully understand the implications of the order and had willingly consented to the appointment.8.Efforts to trace the biological parents of the child proved futile. A letter dated 18 August 2020 from New Life Home Trust indicates that the father of the child had agreed to meet with New Life as well as the sub-country Children’s Officer sometime in May 2019, but he failed to turn up. The final letter from the Muthangari Police Station dated 8 August 2020 indicates that the father’s whereabouts were still unknown. I, therefore, dispense with the requirement for consent from the biological parents.The Adoption Application9.I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed in a bid to determine whether the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.10.Kenya Children’s Home Adoption Society conducted an assessment of the Applicants and filed a report dated 8 July 2024. At the hearing, the child seemed very shy, but was able to identify the Applicants as “mom” and “dad’.11.On 11 April 2024, the Court issued an order appointing Danson Thuo Kuria as the child’s Guardian ad Litem, and further directing the Guardian ad Litem and Director of Children’s Services to investigate the suitability and fitness of the Applicant and subsequently file their respective reports.12.The Guardian ad Litem filed her report dated 30th April 2024, recommending the adoption. The Directorate of Children’s Services, Nairobi County filed its report dated 29 April 2024, recommending the adoption of the child by the Applicants herein.13.From the material availed and oral testimonies, I am satisfied that the Applicants are quite suited to be adoptive parents.14.Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:i.That the Applicants, K.M and R.M.N, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby S. F alias Abandoned Unknown Baby Boy alias Baby S.F.M;ii.That henceforth, the child shall be known as D.M;iii.The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges underthe Constitutionof Kenya and all applicable laws;iv.J.M.N and J.M.M are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,v.The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;vi.That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 29 DAY OF AUGUST 2024HELENE R.

J Ndengeri, Senior   Resident   Magistrate   vide   Chief   Magistrate Criminal Case S/O No. 22 of 2018 delivered on 31st July 2022)Judgment1.The appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the Sexual Offences Act No. 3 of 2006 (herein “the Act”). The particulars of the offence read that on 5thday of April 2018 at [Particulars withheld] center in Naivasha Township within Nakuru County, the appellant intentionally and unlawfully caused his fingers to penetrate the genital organ namely; vagina of MWM, a girl aged 9 years old.2.He was also charged in an alternative count with the offence of indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the Act. The particulars thereof are that, on 5thday of April 2018 at [Particulars withheld] center in Naivasha Township within Nakuru County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his fingers to come into contact with the genital organ namely vagina of MWM, a girl aged 9 years old.3.The charges were read to the appellant and he pleaded not guilty. The case proceeded to full hearing. However, in the course of the trial, the charge sheet was amended wherein the appellant was charged with the offence of sexual assault contrary to section 5(1) (a) (i) and (2) of the Act. The particulars thereof remained as earlier stated that; on 5thday of April 2018 at [Particulars withheld] center in Naivasha Sub-County within Nakuru County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his fingers to penetrate the genital organ namely vagina of MWM, a girl aged 9 years old.4.The appellant was also charged with an alternative charge of performing an indecent act with a minor contrary to section 11(1) of the Act. That, on 5thday of April 2018 at [Particulars withheld] center in Naivasha Township within Nakuru County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his fingers to come into contact with the genital organ namely vagina of MWM, a girl aged 9 years old.5.The appellant maintained a plea of not guilty when the amended charges were read to him. The prosecution’s case proceeded to full hearing with evidence led to the effect that, on 5thday of April 2018 MWM (herein “the complainant”), a child aged nine (9) years old was playing outside a salon where the appellant was operating a barbershop.6.That, she was in the company of her friend called K. That, K’s father took her home leaving the complainant alone. That the appellant asked her to accompany him to the salon cum barbershop but she refused fearing her mother would beat her. However the appellant pulled her into the barbershop, lowered her pants and inserted fingers into her private parts.7.That after the incident, the appellant released her to go home and when she reached where her mother was the mother noticed that the complainant’s trouser was not zipped and the belt was open. She inquired into the matter and the complainant told her what had happened. The mother took her to the hospital and reported the matter to the police station. Thereafter investigations commenced, the appellant was arrested and charged accordingly.8.At the close of the prosecution case, the appellant was placed on his defence. In a sworn statement he denied committing the offence and told the court to take note that, he did not participate in the commission of the offence. That he was charged due to malice.9.In cross-examination he admitted he used to see the complainant playing outside the barbershop and that the complainant’s mother worked in a nearby salon. He further conceded that the complainant went to the barbershop where he was working but denied the allegation that her mother went there. That he only saw the complainant’s mother the day she went to the barbershop in the company of other salon ladies. Further, the owner of the barbershop had a grudge with the complainant’s mother. However, he agreed that he did not have a grudge with the complainant’s mother or the victim.10.At the conclusion of the case, the trial court delivered a judgment dated 31stJuly 2022 in which the appellant was found guilty as charged on the main count of sexual assault and sentenced to serve a custodial sentence of seven (7) years.11.However, the appellant is aggrieved by the decision of the trial court and appeals against it based on the following grounds: -a)That the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant without taking directions after the Amendment of the charge sheet.b)That the Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant on charges that were defective in relation to the facts and/or particulars of the Amended charge sheet.c)That the sentence was manifestly harsh, oppressive and excessive in the special circumstances of this case.d)That the evidence on record could not support the charges and the resultant conviction and sentence.e)That the learned trial magistrate did not grant the appellant an option of fine and/or a non-custodial sentence.12.The appeal was opposed by the respondent based on the grounds of opposition dated 18thDecember 2023 which states: -a)That the charge sheet was proper before court and not defective.b)That all the ingredients of the offences which includes age, identification and sexual assault were sufficient proved beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution witnesses’ testimony corroborated.c)That the sentence imposed on the appellant was as provided by law in line with the circumstances of the offence.d)That the appeal is misconceived and devoid of merit and ought to be dismissed forthwith and the conviction and sentence upheld.13.Subsequently, the appeal was disposed of vide filing of submissions. The appellant in submissions dated, 18thJanuary 2024 abandoned grounds (3) and (4) of and argued on grounds (1), (2) and (5) of appeal.14.The appellant and identified four (4) issues for determination as: -a.Whether the learned trail Magistrate erred in both law and facts in convicting the appellant without taking directions after the amendment of the charge sheet.b.Whether the learned trial magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant on charges that were defective in relation to the facts and/or particulars of the amended charge sheet.c.Whether the evidence on record could not support the charges and resultant conviction and sentence.d.Whether the learned trial Magistrate did not grant the appellant an option of a fine and/or non-custodial senetnce15.The appellant submitted on the first issue that, the trial court failed to inform him and/or his advocate of his right to recall PW1 the complainant after the amendment of the charge sheet, which is contrary to the provisions of section 214(1)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 75) Laws of Kenya, and in violation of Article 50(2) of the Constitution of Kenya.16.That, the complainant was the key witness to the case and the failure to recall her to testify or be cross-examined after amending the charge sheet greatly prejudiced the appellant’s case and lead to his conviction and sentence.17.The appellant relied on the case of; Director of Public Prosecutions vs Swazuri & 24 Otehrs (criminal Revision E003 of 2023)[2023] KEHC 22153 (KLR) (14 September 2023) (Ruling) where the High Court stated that, the court jurisdiction to order the amendment of a charge under section 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is unfettered the only condition being that the accused shall be called upon to plead to the amended charge, and have witnesses recalled to testify afresh or to be cross examined.18.He further relied on the case of; Richard Charo Mule vs Republic Nairobi Court of Appeal Criminal No. 135 of 2004 where the court stated that failure to comply with section 200(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code ought to render a trial a nullity.19.The appellant urged the court to allow the appeal based on section 200(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code and the case of; Mercy Mugure vs Republic [2018] eKLR where the High Court held failure by the succeeding Magistrate to comply with section 200(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code infringed the appellant’s right to fair hearing under Article 50 of the Constitution and therefore all subsequent proceedings were unconstitutional and could not stand.20.On the second issue, the appellant argued that, the amended charge sheet was defective in the facts and particulars as he was not informed of his right to recall witnesses.21.On whether the evidence of record supported the charge and the resultant conviction and sentence, the appellant submitted that the trial Magistrate completely ignored his evidence and solely relied on the prosecution evidence without cautioning itself that, the prosecution evidence was adduced by a child while other witnesses were not present nor saw what happened.22.Lastly, on failure by the trial Magistrate to grant the appellant a non-custodial sentence, the appellant reiterated his mitigation in the trial court and argued that, there were no aggravating circumstances, that he was a first offender, and that no one was harmed and/or deprived of their right before, during and/or after the commission of the offence.23.He cited Regulation 7.19 of the Sentencing Guidelines Gazette Notice No. 2970 which states that a trial court should consider a non-custodial sentence considering the gravity of the offence and therefore the sentence was harsh and capricious.24.However, the respondent vide submissions dated 18thDecember 2023, argued that, the charge sheet was not fatally defective as the charge was supported by the correct particulars and was not in variance with the evidence adduced and therefore the appellant was not prejudice in any manner.25.The respondent submitted that, the prosecution proved the elements of the offence being age, identification and sexual assault, beyond reasonable doubt. That, the birth certificate proved the victim was a minor, while the P3 for produced by the doctor indicated the victim had lost her hymen through sexual assault. Further, identification was by way of recognition as the minor knew the appellant well.26.Finally, the respondent submitted the sentence of seven (7) years imprisonment was in accordance with the law thus lawful. Further, taking into account the age of the minor the trial court had discretion to enhance the sentence but chose not to and imposed the present sentence which is lenient in the circumstances.27.At the conclusion of hearing of the appeal and considering the arguments and submissions by the parties, I note that the role of the first appellate court as held by the Court of Appeal in the case of; Okeno vs. Republic (1972) EA 32, is to re-evaluate the evidence adduced in the trial court afresh and arrive at its own conclusion, noting that this court did not benefit from the demeanour of the witnesses.28.As regard the instant matter, I have considered the appeal in the light of the material placed before the court and I note that, the charge of sexual is provided for under section 5 (1) of the Act which states as follows: -1)Any person who unlawfully—(a)penetrates the genital organs of another person with—(i)any part of the body of another or that person; or(ii)an object manipulated by another or that person except where such penetration is carried out for proper and professional hygienic or medical purposes;(b)manipulates any part of his or her body or the body of another person so as to cause penetration of the genital organ into or by any part of the other person’s body, is guilty of an offence termed sexual assault.29.To revert back to this matter, the appellant has raised basically three grounds that no directions were taken after the charge was amended as to his rights to recall the complainant who had testified and as a result charges were defective. Further there was no adequate evidence to support the charge and/or the sentence meted out was harsh and he was denied a non-custodial sentence.30.The appellant submits that he was not informed of his right to recall witnesses after amendment of the charges. However, as he rightfully points out in his submissions, section 214(1)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code states that it is the accused wo has the right to demand that any witness who had testified before the charge is amended be recalled. It is not for the court to move suo moto to do so.31.It is also noteworthy that the appellant was represented by the learned counsel Mr. Musili who never applied for recall of the complainant. Hence that ground of appeal has no substance.32.Furthermore, section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not apply to amendment of charges. It applies where a matter is taken over by a succeeding Magistrate. In the instant matter, the record of appeal clearly indicates at page 34 of the record of appeal that the subject provisions were adhered to.33.As regard the argument that the charges were defective in that the appellant was not informed of the right to recall witnesses. The court finds the same equally lacks substance as the provisions applicable for framing charges are clear under section 134 and 137 of the Criminal Procedure Code and do not support the arguments advanced. The court notes that the charges were properly framed in form and substance and when read out, the appellant responded thereto appropriately and accordingly.34.As to whether the prosecution adduced adequate evidence to support the charge, I find that, the evidence of PW3 Benjamin Kuria a clinical officer from Naivasha Sub-County Referral Hospital who produced the medical report stated that, when he examined the complainant, he noted that her hymen was missing. He further stated that, she had bruises on the labia minora, and concluded that, there was partial penetration.35.He also produced a PRC form filled by Bethwell Omondi, a clinical officer which reflected similar clinical findings as in the p3 form. In re-examination, the doctor stated that it is not usual for a nine (9) year-old child to have lost her virginity and that, the vaginal examination of the complainant revealed that, she had been fingered and thus sexually assaulted.36.The afore evidence was not rebutted and based on the definition of “penetration” under the Sexual Offences Act, that it means the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person, I find the element of penetration was proved.37.The complainant also testified that the appellant inserted fingers in her private parts. The appellant admits that he was with the complainant at his place of work. None one else was there. The child was found with her trouser opened and she immediately told her mother upon inquiry what the appellant had done. Why would the child lie? And if the appellant did not do anything to her, why would the doctor find that there was evidence of penetration into her private which was injured.38.In addition, PW2 JWM testified that when she went looking for the complainant, she was told the complainant was at the appellant’s barbershop and she saw the appellant leave the shop. That upon learning of what had happened she returned to the appellant’s shop but he had locked and left.39.PW3 Lucy Wairimu who was operating a salon attached to the appellant’s barbershop confirmed that the complainant and other children used to go to the salon and barbershop to play. That on the material date she saw the complainant and one K at the salon. Thus the evidence of this witness confirms the fact that the appellant had an opportunity with the child on the material day and could have committed the offence.40.Further although PW3 stated that she left with the complainant and K and told them to go home, evidence has it that K was picked by the father and the complainant remained.41.Based on the afore evidence and I find and hold that the evidence advanced by the appellant is a mere denial. He does not advance any reason why the complainant a young child or the mother would frame him yet he acknowledged that there was no bad blood between them.42.As a result, I find the conviction verdict was safe and decline to interfere with it.43.In relation to sentence I note that the sentence of the offence is provided for under section 5 (2) which states: -“A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years but which may be enhanced to imprisonment for life.”44.Pursuant to the afore the sentence of seven (7) years herein is unlawful and I set it aside and substitute with a sentence of ten (10) years imprisonment from the date of sentence in the trial court but to consider the period spent in custody if any.45.It is so ordered.DATED, DELIVERED AND SIGNED ON THIS 21STDAY OF AUGUST 2024.GRACE L NZIOKAJUDGEIn the presence of:The appellant present virtuallyMr. Ouma for the appellantMr. Ndiema for the respondentMs. Ogutu: court assistant",Henry v Republic (Criminal Appeal E056 of 2023) [2024] KEHC 10352 (KLR) (21 August 2024) (Judgment),Criminal Appeal E056 of 2023,"GL Nzioka & GL Nzioka, JJ","August 21, 2024",

CRA NO. 23 of 2014)Judgment1.The appellant, EAO was charged with the offence of defilement of a girl contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8 (2) of theSexual Offences ActNo. 3 of 2006.2.The particulars of the offence were that on the 5thday of January 2012 between 6:30AM and 5:PM at (particulars withheld), he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of VK, a girl aged 5 years.3.In the alternative, the appellant faced a charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the same Act. The particulars of the offence were that at the same time and place, he intentionally and unlawfully with his penis touched the vagina of VK, a girl aged 5 years.4.The appellant denied the charge pursuant to which a full trial ensued with the State calling a total of 4 prosecution witnesses while the appellant in his defence elected to give an unsworn statement and called no witness.5.At the conclusion of the trial conducted by L. Kiniale, the then Ag. Senior Resident Magistrate Kericho, the learned trial magistrate found that the evidence on record showed that the appellant was the father to the victim and thus the appropriate charge in the circumstances would have been incest. She nevertheless convicted the appellant of the main charge of defilement that he had been charged with and sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment 9thMay 2014.6.Subsequent thereto and pursuant to the provisions of Section 363 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the learned trial magistrate placed the proceedings leading to the appellant’s conviction and sentence before the high court (Sergon J), for perusal and satisfaction as to the correctness, legality, propriety or otherwise, of the decision.7.Vide a Ruling delivered on 26thJune 2014, Sergon J, found inter alia that the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment meted out on the appellant was illegal and substituted the same with a sentence of life imprisonment.8.The appellant being aggrieved by the decision of the trial court, lodged his first appeal before the high court challenging his conviction and sentence, vide a Petition of Appeal dated 14thMay 2014, which appeal was dismissed by Muya J on 9thNovember 2016, who upheld his conviction and sentence.9.Undeterred, the appellant has now filed an appeal to this Court vide a Notice of Appeal dated 10thNovember 2016 and undated “homemade” Amended Grounds of Appeal raising 8 grounds of appeal.10.When the matter came up for hearing on 28thNovember 2023, the appellant informed us that he was abandoning his appeal on conviction and requested to be allowed to serve the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment that had been initially imposed by the trial court. Miss Kisoo learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand relied entirely on her written submissions dated 23rdNovember 2023.11.The brief facts in this appeal were as follows; PW1 was JKM and the mother to the victim. It was her evidence that the appellant was her husband and that on 5th January 2012, she woke up and left for work and woke up VK (the victim), but the appellant told her not to wake her up as she had a flu.12.It was her further evidence that upon her return from work at 3:00PM, she noticed VK was not walking properly. She called her neighbor to ascertain as she was breastfeeding her other baby and the said neighbor told her that the reason why VK was not walking properly was probably due to the short dress she was wearing.13.They then called the child to check on her but she cried out and told her not to beat her and further stated that it was her father (the appellant), who had done bad manners to her. She got shocked and when she asked her other neighbours to ask her what had happened, she maintained that it was her father who had done bad manners to her.14.It was her further evidence that she checked the child and saw discharge coming from her vagina and noticed that the child was badly injured. She later took the child to hospital and when she returned, she found the appellant had already been arrested. She then asked the appellant if she had defiled the child and he admitted that he had done it twice and that the devil had come upon him and sought forgiveness.15.We have considered the record, the brief highlights made before us and the law. The appeal herein is a second appeal. Our mandate in a second appeal is provided in Section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It provides:“...361(i)A party to an appeal from a subordinate court may, subject to subsection (8), appeal against a decision of the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction on a matter of law, and the Court of Appeal shall not hear an appeal under this section:a.on a matter of fact, and severity of sentence is a matter of fact; orb.against sentence, except where a sentence has been enhanced by the High Court, unless the subordinate court had no power under section 7 to pass that sentence.”16.The above provision has been enunciated in several decisions of this Court. In David Njoroge Macharia vs. Republic [2011] eKLR sums up the said mandate. In the said decision, it was stated:“Only matters of law fall for consideration and the court will not normally interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below unless such findings are based on no evidence, or are based on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the courts below are shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in making the findings. (see also Chemagong vs. Republic [1984] KLR 213).”17.The appellant having abandoned his ground of appeal on conviction we are only left with one issue for our determination namely; sentence, in which he has requested that he be allowed to serve the 20 years’ imprisonment that had initially been imposed by the trial court.18.It was submitted for the respondent that the appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (2) of theSexual Offences Act, which provides for a mandatory life imprisonment and that the sentence that was passed against the appellant was lawful.19.As we had alluded to earlier and was correctly observed by the learned trial magistrate, the appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (2) of theSexual Offences Act. The evidence on record however, disclosed a charge of incest as the victim was the appellant’s daughter.20.Section 8 (1) (2) of theSexual Offences Actprovides that a person charged with the offence of defilement shall be sentenced to life imprisonment upon conviction. Section 20 (1) of the same Act, which creates the offence of incest by males provides as follows:“20.Incest by male persons(1)Any male person who commits an indecent act or an act which causes penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years:Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and itshall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.” (Emphasis Ours).21.It is evident that under the provisions of Section 8 (1) (2) of theSexual Offences Act, the sentence provided thereunder is a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment, where the victim is 11 years or less, unlike the provisions in Section 20 (1) of the Act (supra), which give some leeway as the sentence of 10 years is the minimum sentence whereas life imprisonment provided thereof (where the victim is below 18 years) is the discretionary maximum sentence.22.See the case of MK v Republic [2015] eKLR where this Court while addressing itself on this issue stated thus:“In the instant case, the appellant was charged with an offence under Section 20 (1) of theSexual Offences Act. This Section provides for a minimum term of 10 years’ imprisonment. However, the proviso to Section 20(1) stipulates that if the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life. The learned judge of the High Court interpreted this proviso to mean that a mandatory minimum sentence for life is provided for in the proviso if the female victim is under the age of eighteen years. The legal question for our consideration and determination is whether this interpretation is correct; does the proviso provide for a minimum term of life imprisonment""The first observation to note is that the phrase “not less than” has not been used in the proviso to Section 20 (1) of theSexual Offences Act. The inference is that the proviso does not create a minimum sentence. The phraseology and wording in the proviso is that the accused shall be liable to imprisonment for life.What does “shall be liable” mean in law"" The Court of Appeal for East Africa in the case of Opoya -v- Uganda (1967) EA 752 had an opportunity to clarify and explain the words“shall be liable on conviction to suffer death”. The Court held that in construction of penal laws, the words “shall be liable on conviction to suffer death” provide a maximum sentence only; and the courts have discretion to impose sentences of death or of imprisonment.The Court cited with approval the dicta in James -v- Young 27 Ch. D. at p.655 where North J. said:“But when the words are not ‘shall be forfeited’ but ‘shall be liable to be forfeited’ it seems to me that what was intended was not that there should be an absolute forfeiture, but a liability to forfeiture, which might or might not be enforced”.We consider such to be the correct approach to the construction of the words “shall be liable on conviction to suffer death: especially when contrasted with the words of s.184 which are “shall be sentenced to death”.On our part, we contrast the wordings in Section 8 (2) of theSexual Offences Actwith the proviso in Section 20 (1) of the said Act. The contrast will shed light as to whether the sentence in the proviso to Section 20 (1) is minimum and mandatory or otherwise. Section 8 (2) provides that a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life. The proviso in Section 20 (1) provides that the accused shall be liable to imprisonment for life.Guided by the decision in Opoya -v- Uganda (1967) EA 752 and the persuasive dicta of North J. in James -v- Young 27 Ch. D. at p.655; we are satisfied that the sentence stipulated in the proviso to Section 20 (1) of theSexual Offences Actis not a minimum mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. The proviso simply states that the trial court has discretion to mete out a maximum term of life imprisonment. Read in conjunction with the general provision in Section 20 (1) we hereby state that the correct interpretation of the proviso in Section 20 (1) is that a person convicted of incest when the female victim is under the age of eighteen years is liable to a term of imprisonment between 10 years and life imprisonment.” (Emphasis Ours).23.We fully agree and adopt the reasoning by the Court in the above cited case. Having said that, it is clear to our mind that the holding by the learned judge that; “Either way, therefore, no prejudice was caused to the appellant as both offences carry the same punishment”, was wholly erroneous. Suffice to state that the proviso to section 20(1) provides that a person can be sentenced to life imprisonment.24.We have looked at the circumstances under which the offence was committed. PW1, the mother of the victim left her husband with their daughter. The victim was 5 years old. Instead of the appellant providing care and protection to his 5 year old daughter, he committed a heinous act against her. We think that the sentence imposed was appropriate. We find no merit in the appellant’s appeal against the enhanced sentence.25.Accordingly, the appellant’s appeal is hereby dismissed.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAKURU THIS 21STDAY OF AUGUST 2024.F.

Wendoh, J.) dated 6th March, 2015 in HC Cr. A. No. 42 of 2011)JudgmentBackground1.The appellant, Tony Kiambu M’Mutea, was convicted and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment by the Chief Magistrate’s court at Meru for the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8 (3) of theSexual Offences Act.2.The particulars of the main charge were that on 20thAugust, 2010 at around 9.00p.m at [Particulars withheld] village in Meru Central the appellant intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of BND, a child aged 13 years.3.In count II the appellant was charged with the offence of indecent Act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of theSexual Offences Act. The particulars of the charge were that on 20thAugust, 2010 at around 9:00p.m at [Particulars withheld] village in Meru Central the appellant intentionally touched the vagina of BND (name withheld) with his penis against her will.4.The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges and the prosecution called six (6) witnesses in support of its case.5.BND (PW1) testified that she was 13 years old and was born on 12thDecember 1997. It was her evidence that on 20thAugust 2010 at around 9:00p.m she was at the appellant’s homestead where she had  been for three days. That the appellant’s mother was away and had requested her to stay in her house with the children of the appellant’s sister. PW1 testified that one child named M went to the appellant’s house to borrow a matchbox and after use, the appellant, well known to PW1 as Tony, while at his house, called PW1 and asked her to return the matchbox to him. PW1 testified that she  returned the matchbox to the appellant who was standing at the door to his house. It was her further evidence that the appellant held her neck and covered her mouth and took her inside his house.6.PW1 testified further that the appellant laid her on the floor, tore her clothes while holding both her hands together and covered her mouth with a piece of cloth. It was her testimony that he defiled her from 9:00pm until 11:00pm when Lucy Kagwira (PW2) called the appellant whereupon he released her. It was her further evidence that JK gave her a trouser to wear as she had left the appellant’s house without her clothes. It was PW1’s further testimony that PW2 called PW1’s aunt, AK (PW3) who took her to Meru Police Station and later to Meru General Hospital for examination and treatment as she was in pain.7.Lucy Kagwira (PW2) testified that she was the appellant’s sister in law and was PWI’s neighbour. It was her evidence that on the material night at about 11:00pm JK (PW4) went to her house and informed her that the appellant had locked PW1 in his house. PW2 testified that she went to the appellant’s house and called the appellant who did not respond. It was her further evidence that she then called PW1’s name and PW1 came out of the appellant’s house. It was her evidence that PW1 was crying and when she asked her if anything wrong was done to her PW1 initially hesitated and subsequently informed her that something bad had been done to her. PW2 further testified that PW1 narrated to her and other family members who had arrived at the scene that the appellant had lured her into his house and defiled her.8.AK (PW3), who was an aunt and guardian to PW1 testified that on the material night, she was sleeping in her house at about 1.00a.m when she was called by PW2 who informed her that JK (PW4) had called and informed her the appellant had locked PW1 in his house. PW3 testified that she woke up and went to the house where PW1 and JK ordinarily slept where she found PW1 crying. It was her testimony that PW1 tearfully narrated to her that the appellant had defiled her. PW3 testified further that she took PW1 to Meru Police Station and later to Meru General Hospital where she was examined and treated.9.JK (PW4) was a minor aged 12 years and the appellant’s niece who testified that on the material night, while she was sleeping, she noted that PW1 was not in her bed where she ordinarily slept. It was her testimony that she called PW2 and informed her that PW1 was not in their house whereupon PW2 went to the appellant’s house and called PW1 who responded from the appellant’s house.10.No. 60169 SDA Catherine Nyaga (PW5) was the Investigating Officer who testified that she was attached to Meru Police Station and that on 20thAugust, 2010 at around 11:00p.m she was at the police station as the duty officer when PW1 was taken by members of the public and her guardian (PW3) complaining that she had been defiled by  the appellant. PW5 testified that she interrogated PW1 and later  carried out her investigations. It was her further testimony that she went to the scene where she recovered PW1’s jeans trouser under the appellant’s mattress. It was here further evidence that she then led the arrest of the appellant who had disappeared on the material night. She produced PW1’s birth certificate which indicated that she was born on 11thDecember, 1995.11.Dr. Issac Macharia (PW6) testified that his colleague examined and treated PW1 on 20thAugust, 2011. PW6 testified that the doctor who examined PW1 found that her hymen was freshly perforated and that there was evidence of sexual intercourse. PW6 produced the P3 form.12.The appellant was found to have a case to answer and was put on his defence. He gave sworn evidence and chose not to call any witness. The appellant denied committing the offence for which he was charged. He testified that on the day that he was arrested he went to Thimangiri to work. His evidence was that the case of defilement was fabricated against him by PW3 as he had a disagreement with her at home. In cross-examination he testified that he had not reported any complaints relating to the alleged disagreement against PW3 and that there was no pending case between them.13.After conclusion of the case, the trial court convicted the appellant and sentenced him to twenty-five (25) years’ imprisonment for count I and ten (10) years imprisonment for count II. The two sentences were to run concurrently.14.The appellant was aggrieved by the conviction and sentence and appealed to the High Court at Meru (R.P.V. Wendoh, J.). In a judgment delivered on 6thMarch, 2015, the learned Judge held as follows:“I find no reason to fault the trial court’s judgment. Upon conviction, the trial court went ahead and convicted the appellant on both the 1stcharge of defilement and the second charge of indecent act thus falling into serious error. The two offences arise from the same transaction. The second charge should have been an alternative of the main charge and once a finding was made on the main charge, no finding should have been made on the alternative charge. For that reason, I quash the conviction on the second charge and set aside the sentence of 10 years imprisonment. A person who defiles a girl aged 12 to 15 years is liable to imprisonment for not less than 20 years imprisonment upon conviction. The appellant was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. The sentence is not excessive, it is lawful and I confirm it. In the end, the appeal partially succeeds in respect of count 11 and the appellant will serve 25 years imprisonment on count 1. It is so ordered.”15.Dissatisfied by the judgment, the appellant lodged a second appeal to this Court appealing against both conviction and sentence. The appellant who was unrepresented submitted that he relies on the grounds of appeal stated in the submissions and  abandoned the grounds in the memorandum of appeal. The grounds of appeal as stated in the submissions are that:i.The learned Judge erred in law by failing to note that the sentence meted by the lower court is manifestly harsh and excessive.ii.The learned appellate judge erred in matters of law by failing to note that there was possibility of mistaken identity since the evidence of the clinical officer proved that the complainant was defiled.iii.Error of law and fact by not invoking the time spent in custody while sentencing the appellant as stipulated under section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Chapter 75 Laws of Kenya.16.The memorandum of appeal had the following grounds of appeal:i.That both the High Court Judge and the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and facts in failing to observe that the prosecution tendered unreliable, inconsistent and contradictory evidence and lacked the material to prove the ingredients of the offence;ii.Error in law in failing to make a finding that there was an existing grudge between the appellant and the child who tailored all that against him;iii.Error in failing to make a finding that investigations, the court proceedings and the charges suffered procedural irregularities;iv.Failure to see the whole case was not proved beyond reasonable doubt to justify conviction;v.Error in convicting the appellant without considering that the overt act which amounts to commit the offence was not in existence in the evidence of witnesses;vi.Failing to consider that there was insufficiency of evidence connecting the appellant to the offence of which the evidence was not only reliable but inadmissible;vii.Error in convicting appellant without considering that from the whole evidence given in court there was no eye witnesses; andviii.Sentence meted was manifestly excessive.17.At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was unrepresented while Ms. Nandwa, learned Prosecution Counsel was on record for the respondent. Both parties had filed their written submissions, which they both relied on.18.The appellant submitted that identification was not free from error as it was dark as per the evidence of PW1 and further that PW1 testified that the assailant did not talk to her. The appellant submitted that the evidence tendered by PW4 showed that the scene of crime was a house shared by three brothers (PW4’s uncles) including the appellant and it was difficult to know who the assailant was from among the three brothers. The appellant relied on the case of John Waithaka Chege vs Republic [1979] eKLR for the proposition that great care should be exercised where the conditions for favourable identification are poor.19.The appellant further submitted that his defence was faulted without any cogent reasons. He submitted that he had made a sworn statement and raised a defence of alibi, however, no enquiry was made regarding the said defence. The appellant further testified that he had a grudge with PW3 who was the aunt and guardian of PW1 and that the charge of defilement against him was therefore a frame up. The appellant further submitted that neither the trial court nor the1stappellate Court considered the issue of the existence of the grudge that he raised.20.Regarding sentencing, the appellant submitted that the provision that a convict for the offence of defilement with a child between the age of 12 and 15 years is liable for a term of not less than twenty years (20) curtail the sentencing discretion and offends the constitutional dictates of fair trial. The appellant further submitted that he ought to have been sentenced to 20 years and not 25 years’ imprisonment. Further, that on reliance of the sentencing guidelines, the maximum sentence should not be imposed on first offenders unless there are aggravating circumstances. The appellant relied upon the case of Republic vs Jagani & another [2001] KLR 590 for the proposition that this Court has jurisdiction to interfere with a sentence imposed where, among other reasons, the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.21.The appellant further submitted that the period he was in custody was not taken into account during sentencing. The appellant relied on the case of Ahamad Abolfathi Mohamed & Another vs Republic [2018] eKLR. The appellant urged us to allow the appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence.22.Ms. Nandwa, learned counsel for the State opposed the appeal. Counsel asserted that the trial court and the 1stappellate court found the evidence of the prosecution to be truthful and credible. Counsel relied on the case of MTG vs Republic (Criminal Appeal E067 of 2021) [2022] KEHC189 (KLR) where the High Court (Mativo, J. – as he then was) held that:“… Minor or trivial contradictions do not affect the credibility of a witness and cannot vitiate a trial. The correct approach is to read the evidence tendered holistically…”.23.Counsel submitted further that the alleged grudge alluded to by the appellant was between him and PW3 and not PW1 who was the complainant. Counsel asserted that if at all there was a grudge between the appellant and PW3 then PW3 would not have let PW1 keep the company of the appellant’s nieces when the appellant’s mother was away. Counsel further submitted that all ingredients of the offence of defilement were proved, that is, the age of the complainant was proved by production of a birth certificate to be 15 years at the time of the commission of the offence; PW1 testified that the appellant defiled her; the medical examination conducted on PW1 and the P3 form produced showed evidence of penetration; and the appellant was positively identified. Counsel maintained that identification was by recognition, as the appellant was well known to PW1, as they were neighbours. Counsel further submitted that the appellant did not deny the fact that he knew PW1. Further, PW3 confirmed that the appellant was their neighbour.24.Counsel asserted that on the material night, PW2 called out to PW1 who came out from the appellant’s house. Counsel relied upon the case of Francis Muchiri Joseph vs Republic [2014] eKLR on the issue of identification by recognition where this Court stated as follows:“In Lesaru vs 1988 KLR 783, this Court emphasized that where identification is based on recognition by reason of long acquaintance, there is not better mode of identification that by name. In R Vs Turnbull (1976) 3 All ER 551, Lord Widgrey CJ observed that the quality of identification evidence is critical: if the quality is good and remains good at the close of the defence case, the danger of mistaken identification is lessened, but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger…Recognition may be more reliable than identification of a stranger, but even when the witness is purporting to recognize someone whom he knows, the jury should be reminded that mistakes in recognition of close relatives and friends are sometimes made.”25.On the sentence, counsel submitted that the sentence imposed on the appellant was appropriate noting the gravity of the offence and its effect on the victim, PW1. Counsel submitted that under the Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guidelines, courts are bound by the minimum mandatory sentences and cannot impose a sentence below what is prescribed. In conclusion counsel submitted that the respondent proved its case beyond reasonable doubt for the offence of defilement. Counsel urged us to dismiss the appeal for lack of merit and uphold both the conviction and sentence.Determination26.This being a second appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to consideration of matters of law only. Section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that:-“361.(1)A party to an appeal from a subordinate court may, subject to subsection (8), appeal against a decision of the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction on a matter of law, and the Court of Appeal shall not hear an appeal under this section –a.on a matter of fact, and severity of sentence is a matter of fact; orb.against sentence, except where a sentence has been enhanced by the High Court, unless the subordinate court had no power under section 7 to pass that sentence.”27.This Court in the case of Chemagong v Republic [1984] KLR 213 on page 219 stated as follows:-“A second appeal must be confined to points of law and this Court will not interfere with concurrent findings of facts arrived at in the two courts below unless based on no evidence. The test to be applied on second appeal is whether there was any evidence on which the trial court could find as it did. (Reuben Karari s/o Karanja vs. Republic [1950] 17 EACA146).” See also Karingo v R. [1982] KLR 213.28.With the above in mind, we have considered the appeal, the submissions, the authorities cited and the law.29.We discern four (4) main issues for determination in this appeal to be whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt; whether the defence was properly rejected; whether sentence meted by the trial court and upheld by the 1stappellate court was manifestly harsh and excessive; and whether the time spent in custody by the appellant was taken into account in sentencing by the trial court and the 1stappellate court in compliance by Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.30.Section 8(1) of theSexual Offences Act, provide that:“8(1)A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.”31.On the question whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, this Court in the case of Charles Wamukoya Karani v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 72 of 2013 it was stated as follows:“The critical ingredients forming the offence of defilement are; age of the complainant, proof of penetration and positive identification of the assailant.”32.On the age of PW1, a birth certificate was produced by PW5 which indicated that she was born on 11thDecember, 1995 and that she was therefore 15 years at the time of the commission of the offence. On penetration, PW3 testified that the appellant defiled her. Further, medical evidence adduced by PW6 confirmed that there was penetration and that PW1 was defiled.33.On the identity of the perpetrator, we note that identification of the appellant was based on the evidence of PW1 and PW2. From the record, PW1 was categorical that it was the appellant who took her into his house and defiled her and that she had known him all her life as they were neighbours. Identification of the appellant was therefore through recognition. The complainant knew the appellant well as they were neighbours and on several occasions, the appellant’s mother while away would request PW1 to go and stay in her house with the children of the appellant’s sister. It is notable that the appellant did not dispute that he knew PW1 and that PW2 who was PW1’s aunt and guardian confirmed that the appellant was her neighbour.34.PW2 further testified that on being informed by PW2 that PW1 was locked by the appellant in the house, PW2 called out the name of the appellant but he did not respond. It was her testimony that she then called PW1 who responded and came out from the appellant’s house.There was nothing in evidence to suggest that the house had more than one occupant at the material time. It is also notable that the Investigating Officer, PW5, testified that she found a jean trouser under the appellant’s mattress which PW1 testified she had worn on the material night and which she had left in the appellant’s house when she was called by PW2.35.This Court in Reuben Taabu Anjononi & 2 Others vs. R [1980] KLR stated that:“…recognition of an assailant is more satisfactory, more assuring, and more reliable than identification of a stranger because it depends on the personal knowledge of the assailant in some form or another.”We therefore find that all the ingredients of the offence of defilement were present.36.On the ground that the appellant’s defence was not considered, from the record, the appellant testified that on the material day he left his home in the morning and returned in the evening at 9.00pm when he was arrested. It is notable that the appellant testified regarding the day that he was arrested and not the day of the commission of the  offence.The appellant claimed that there was a grudge between him and PW3. He did not give details of the alleged grudge. The prosecution cast doubt whether PW3 who was PW1’s aunt and guardian would  have allowed PW1 to take care of PW4 when the appellant’s mother was away. We agree – from the evidence of PW1 and PW2, the appellant’s mother on a number of occasions requested PW1 to take care of the appellant’s sisters’ children (including PW4) when she was away. We therefore find that the 1stappellate court did not err in rejecting the appellant’s defence. The appellant’s appeal against conviction therefore fails and is dismissed.37.On the ground that the sentence was harsh and excessive, the appellant was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment for the offence of defilement by the trial court which was upheld by the 1stappellate court. Section 8(3) of theSexual Offences Actprovides as follows:(3)A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years.”38.In ShadrackKipkoech Koogo v R Eldoret Criminal Appeal No. 253 of 2023this Court reiterated that:“Sentence is essentially an exercise of discretion by the trial court and for this court to interfere it must be shown that in passing the sentence, the sentencing court took into account an irrelevant factor or that a wrong principle was applied or that short of these, the sentence itself is so excessive and therefore an error of principle must be inferred (see also Sayeka vs. R (1989 KLR 306).”39.From the record, the appellant preyed on a 13-year-old girl who was taking care of his sister’s children. Section 8(3) of the Sexual Offences Act provides for an imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years where the victim is aged between the ages of 12 and 15 years.Accordingly, we see no reason to interfere with the sentence of 25 years imprisonment imposed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court.40.The appellant has urged us to take into account the period that he was in custody as that was not considered during sentencing. This Court in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohamed & Another vs Republic (supra) held as follows:“Taking into account the period spent in custody must mean considering that period so that the imposed sentence is reduced proportionately by the period already spent in custody. It is not enough for the court to merely state that it has taken into account the period already spent in custody and still order the sentence to run from the date of the conviction because that amounts to ignoring altogether the period already spent in custody.”41.By parity of reasoning and in accordance with Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the sentence will be effective from 1stSeptember, 2010 which was the date on which the appellant was first arraigned in court. Those shall be the orders of the Court.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NYERI THIS 21STDAY OF AUGUST, 2024W. KARANJA…………………………JUDGE OF APPEALJAMILA MOHAMMED…………………………JUDGE OF APPEALA. O.

Musani, MembersAugust 14, 2024BetweenLNMClaimantandDNORespondentJudgment1.This is a claim involving a husband and wife on disclosure of HIV status to third parties who happen to be close relatives of the parties. This Tribunal previously stated in HAT 60 OF 2022 EKM V MMM. That the family is the corner stone of the society. Article 45(1) ofthe Constitutionof Kenya states that the family is a fundamental unit of the society that needs the recognition and protection of the State. The Judiciary recognizes this fact and encourages Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms including Mediation to solve family disputes so as to maintain family relations.2.In view of the above sentiments, the parties herein were given a chance to attempt out of court settlement but the Claimant was not willing to negotiate. Both parties must submit themselves willingly to the mediation process for it to be a success. The matter therefore proceeded for hearing on 16thMay 2024.The Claimant’s case3.The Claimant adopted her witness statement dated 20thOctober 2023 and testified that the Respondent and herself were husband and wife undergoing the divorce process. The Claimant and Respondent have lived as a discordant couple since the Claimant tested HIV positive in 2003. The Claimant avers that the Respondent kept her HIV status secret until the marriage broke down sometime in June 2023 and on 1stSeptember 2023, while attending a funeral, the Respondent informed CW-2 who is the Claimant’s cousin and was the best lady in the Claimant and Respondent’s wedding that he knew that the Claimant was HIV positive since 2010. On 28thSeptember 2023, he further called CW-2 on her phone and informed her that the Claimant was HIV positive and had convinced him to marry her which was a waste of his time. She further claimed that the Respondent also disclosed her HIV status to her sister CW-3 on 2ndSeptember 2023 while attending another relative’s burial. It was her testimony that as a result of the disclosure, she has suffered loss of privacy resulting into emotional distress and loss of dignity.4.On cross examination, the Claimant confirmed that she has 2 adult children but could not say whether the Respondent has ever disclosed her HIV status to them. She further disputed that this claim was filed after the Respondent filed and served her with the divorce papers and a land dispute involving their children. She further confirmed that she did not witness the disclosure.5.To prove her Case, she called 2 witnesses. Her cousin testified as CW-2 and averred that she met and briefly talked to the Respondent on 1stSeptember 2023 where he informed her that the Claimant had been HIV positive since 2010 and further received a call from the Respondent on 28thSeptember 2023 where he repeated the allegations. On cross examination, she testified that she informed the Claimant a few days later as she was still grieving.6.CW-3 the Claimant’s sister adopted her witness statement and testified that she met the Respondent at a burial on 2ndSeptember 2023 and he informed her that the Claimant had been HIV positive since 2010. However, on cross examination she stated that the Respondent did not disclose the Claimant’s HIV status to her during the burial but that he called her a few days later and informed her of the same.The Respondent’s Case7.The Respondent adopted his witness statement and testified that the Claimant filed this claim as a reaction to a land Case and divorce CASE that had been initiated by the Respondent. It was his testimony that he knew the Claimant’s HIV status in 2003 and they have lived as a discordant couple without him disclosing the Claimant’s HIV status to their children or any third parties.8.He denied informing CW-1 and CW-2 of the Claimant’s HIV status. He admitted to have met and consoled with them in the 2 funerals but insisted that the meetings were too brief and they did not discuss the Claimant.Issues for Determination9.The Tribunal having considered the pleadings filed, the evidence adduced by the parties and the witnesses, considers the following as the issues to be determined:-1.Whether there was unlawful disclosure of the Claimant’s HIV status to third parties by the Respondent?2.Whether the Claimant suffered loss of privacy resulting into emotional distress and loss of dignity?3.Whether the Claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought?Whether there was unlawful disclosure of the Claimants’ HIV status to third parties by the Respondent?10.A person’s HIV status is confidential and should not be revealed to third parties without their consent as provided for under Section 22 (1)(a) of theHIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Actreads:“No person shall disclose any information concerning the result of a HIV test or any related assessments to any other person except with the written consent of that person”11.Disclosure of a person’s HIV status without their consent tantamount to violation of the right to privacy. This Tribunal has previously held that for one to prove disclosure, he/she must show that the disclosure was made to a third party without the Claimant’s consent and tender corroborative evidence either in the form of a person who overheard the oral statement being made or by the publication of the said statement on a platform or a forum that could be easily accessed by a third party.12.In SM v ENO[2018]eKLR we held that a Claimant must call a witness to confirm that indeed, there was disclosure of the claimant’s status to third parties, including the witness. This witness is a crucial key to the puzzle and assists the Tribunal in piecing together a Claimant’s averments and painting the picture of the circumstances under which the disclosure occurred. The witness’s account complements and corroborates that of the Claimant.13.The Claimant testified that the CW-2 and CW-3 informed her that the Respondent disclosed her HIV status to them on separate occasions and called them as witnesses to prove disclosure to third parties. On cross examination, both CW2 and CW-3 confirmed that the disclosure was made to them orally and through phone and there was no recording of the same or an independent witness who over heard the conversation.14.The Respondent in his submissions challenged the evidence of the Claimant and her witnesses regarding the dates the disclosure was made and how the disclosure was made and stated that the mere calling of a witness does not discharge a claimant’s burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the events that the Claimant avers are likely to have taken place.15.In view of the above, we agree with the Respondent’s sentiments that this is a classic case of hearsay and the mere calling of a witness does not discharge a Claimant’s burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the events that the Claimant avers are likely to have taken place. The Claimant relied on hearsay evidence. She ought to have called independent witnesses who heard the Respondent disclose her alleged HIV status to CW-2 and CW-3 so as to meet the threshold set for proof of disclosure of HIV status to third parties. This claim therefore fails.Whether the Claimant suffered loss of privacy resulting into emotional distress and loss of dignity?16.The Claimant allege that as a result of the Respondent disclosing her HIV status to third parties she has suffered loss of privacy resulting into emotional distress and loss of dignity. In MKK v CWN [2016] eKLR the High court set the threshold in establishing psychological suffering as follows:“The plaintiff must prove, and the Court or Tribunal must be satisfied, that the injuries were actually suffered and were proximately caused by the defendants.”17.This is supported by the case of David Bagine v Martin Bundi [1997] eKLR, the Court of Appeal cited the judgment by Lord Goddard CJ. in Bonham Carter v Hyde Park Hotel Limited (1948) 64 TLR 177), where he stated that:[The] Plaintiffs must understand that if they bring actions for damages, it is for them to prove damage. It is not enough to note down the particulars and, so to speak, throw them at the head of the court saying, ‘this is what I have lost’, I ask you to give me these damages; they have to prove it.18.The Claimant failed to lead evidence to prove that she suffered loss of privacy resulting into emotional distress and loss of dignity. She did not give the details of suffering or produce documentary evidence in terms of counseling receipts to prove this fact and as such, this claim fails.Whether the Claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought?19.Having considered the pleadings, evidence on record and analyzed all the issues, it is the finding of this Tribunal that the Claimant has not proved her claim to the requisite standards.20.This cause is, therefore, dismissed. This being a family dispute, Parties are to bear their own costs.Orders accordingly.DATED AND SIGNED AT NAIROBI THIS 14THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.………………………………………………CAROLYNE MBOKU - CHAIRPERSONDELIVERED VIRTUALLY in the presence of:HON.

      [2024] KEHC 10465 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at EmbuCriminal Appeal E003 of 2024LM Njuguna, JAugust 27, 2024BetweenKelvin Gituma NkongeAppellantandRepublicRespondent(Appeal arising from the decision of Hon. N. Kahara SRM in Siakago Magistrate’s Court Sexual Offence No.    E004 of 2023    delivered on 23rd   November 2023)Judgment1.This is an appeal arising from the abovementioned decision. The appellant has filed petition of appeal dated 04thDecember 2023 seeking that the appeal be allowed, conviction be quashed, 10-years imprisonment be set aside and the appellant be set at liberty. The appeal is premised on the grounds that the learned trial magistrate erred in law and facts by:a.Relying on a narrative riddled with material contradictions and the same failed the test of the truthfulness of the complainant;b.Failing to note that the case was a frame up in order to obtain money from the appellant;c.Failing to consider that the ingredients of the offence of committing an indecent act with a child were not proved to the required standards;d.Rejecting the appellant’s water-tight defense without giving cogent reasons;e.Failing to record reasons for believing a single witness contrary to section 124 of theEvidence Act; andf.Imposing harsh and excessive sentence upon the appellant.2.The appellant was charged with 2 counts. The first count was the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of theSexual Offences ActNo. 3 of 2006. The particulars are that on 03rdDecember 2022 at [Particulars withheld] market in Mbeere South Subcounty within Embu County, the appellant intentionally touched the buttocks of PM a child aged 8 years using his hands. The second count was the charge of compelling an indecent act contrary to section 6(a) of theSexual Offences Act, whose particulars are that on 03rdDecember 2022 at [Particulars withheld]  market in Mbeere South subcounty in Embu County, the appellant, intentionally compelled PM a child aged 8 years to touch his penis against her will, an act which was indecent.3.The appellant pleaded not guilty to both counts and a plea of not guilty was duly entered. The prosecution called witnesses in support of its case.4.PW1 was the victim. Following voire dire, the court directed that she gives unsworn testimony. She stated that on the material day, she was on her way home when she saw the appellant dancing outside his shop and he called her. That he asked her to follow him into the shop and she did and the appellant gave her his phone so that she could watch videos on the tiktok app. That while in the shop, the appellant touched her buttocks and then held her hand and forced her to touch his penis, against her will. That afterwards, he gave her a soda to drink and then told her to go home. She stated that she went home and told her mother what had happened and she was taken to Kiritiri Health Center and then they went to Gachoka Police Station. On cross-examination, she stated that besides herself and the appellant, there was nobody else. That she told her mother about the incident after 1 week.5.PW2 was the victim’s mother who produced PW1’s birth certificate. She stated that one day, PW1 told her never to send her to the appellant’s shop because when she was returning from the tailor, she found the appellant dancing outside his shop and he called her to enter. That the appellant followed her and gave her his phone and then he touched her buttocks and made her touch his private parts. That she took her to the health center for examination and then she reported the incident at the police station. That prior to the incident, PW1 had no problem being sent to the appellant’s shop. On cross-examination, she stated that PW1 told her that the appellant called her into the shop when there were no customers there.6.PW3, Judy Ireri, a clinical officer at Kiritiri Health Center stated that she examined PW1 and observed that the hymen was present and the external genitalia was normal. She produced the P3 and PRC forms as evidence indicating that there was no penetration. She stated that the minor was not sexually assaulted.7.PW4 was PC. Pauline Wawira from Gachoka Police Station who stated that the incident was reported at the station as narrated by PW1 and PW2. That she investigated the case and visited the scene where the appellant was arrested and charged accordingly.8.At the end of the prosecution’s case, the court found that the appellant had a case to answer and he was placed on his defense. However, he opted not to give any defense and awaited the court’s judgment.9.The trial court considered the evidence adduced and found the appellant guilty of both counts. The appellant was sentenced to 10-years imprisonment for the 1stcount and 5years imprisonment for the 2ndcount, both sentences running concurrently.10.This appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.11.The appellant, in his submissions, stated that the testimony of PW1 should not be trusted since it does not paint the true picture. He stated that when he gave PW1 his phone to watch videos on the tiktok app, she refused to return it and in the process of him getting his phone back, he pushed her from the backside, thus upsetting PW1. That when he noticed that she was upset, he offered her a soda which she took and then left. That PW2 owed the appellant Kshs.4,000/= which she did not intend to pay and so she framed him and tried to extort him of a further Kshs.15,000/=. That the minor waited 1 week before telling PW2 about the incident. He stated that the issue was not properly investigated and so the evidence cannot sustain a conviction.12.On its part, the respondent submitted that the material elements of the offence were proved beyond reasonable doubt. It relied on the meaning of “indecent act” as provided under section 2 of theSexual Offences Act. It also argued that the testimony of PW1 was sufficient and did not need corroboration as stated under section 124 of theEvidence Actand the case of JWA v. Republic (2014) eKLR. That the appellant did not present any defense to be considered by the court thus, the trial court did not err in that regard. Reliance was placed on the case of Republic v. Nicholas Wambogo (2022) eKLR and stated that the sentences are commensurate with the offences.13.From a perusal of the petition of appeal and submissions, the issues for determination are as follows:a.Whether the prosecution proved the offences beyond reasonable doubt; andb.Whether the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive.14.It is the role of the first appellate court to review the evidence at trial and reach its own conclusion. These were the sentiments of the Court of Appeal in the case of Okeno vs. Republic [1972] EA 32. I agree with the court when it held:“An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and the appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of the first appellate court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s finding and conclusion. It must make its own finding and draw its own conclusions only then can it decide whether the magistrate’s finding should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”15.The offence of committing an indecent act with a child is provided under the section 11(1) of theSexual Offences Actas follows:“Any person who commits an indecent act with a child is guilty of the offence of committing an indecent act with a child and is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years.”16.Similarly, the offence of compelling an indecent act is provided for under section 6 of theSexual Offences Actas follows:“A person who intentionally and unlawfully compels, induces or causes another person to engage in an indecent act with—a.the person compelling, inducing or causing the other person to engage in the act;… is guilty of an offence and is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years.”17.In the same breadth, Section 2 of the same Act defines “indecent act” as:“‘indecent act’ means an unlawful intentional act which causes –a.any contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another, but does not include an act that causes penetration;b.exposure or display of any pornographic material to any person against his or her will”18.PW1 stated that she was returning home from an errand when she saw the appellant dancing outside his shop. That the appellant called her into the shop and he followed her inside then he touched her buttocks. That the appellant gave her his phone to watch videos on the tiktok app and then he took her hand and made her index finger to touch his private parts. PW2 stated that as soon as PW1 told her about the incident, she took her for medical examination and then reported the matter to the police. PW3 established that PW1 had not been sexually assaulted thus the offence satisfies the conditions required to make it an indecent act and compulsion thereof.19.The standard of proof in criminal cases is settled and that is beyond reasonable doubt. See the case of Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 ALL ER 372. The evidence adduced stems from the narration by PW1, the victim. The appellant decries the truthfulness of this evidence and that the trial court did not give its reasons for believing this testimony. The proviso at Section 124 of theEvidence Actprovides that the testimony of the victim under theSexual offences Actdoes not need to be corroborated so long as the court believes that the witness is telling the truth. It states:“Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.”20.In the trial court’s judgment, the learned trial magistrate noted the demeanor of PW1 during her testimony and stated that: “…it is noteworthy that when giving evidence, the minor suddenly started crying while narrating what the accused did to her. Maybe because she felt uncomfortable and bad recalling how the accused violated her…”. This concedes that the trial court had the great advantage of seeing the witnesses testifying first-hand at trial. See the case of David Njuguna Wairimu v. Republic (2010) eKLR. It is this advantage that the trial court used in reaching its decision to believe the testimony of the victim, thereby satisfying the requirement under section 124 of theEvidence Act.21.Having so stated, it is also my view that the testimony of PW1 is believable. Moreover, considering the standard of proof in this case, it is my view that the evidence adduced is sufficient to prove the 2 counts. The appellant, in his submissions, attempted to offer a defense to the effect that PW1 had refused to return his phone and so he pushed her while touching her back. This testimony should have been placed before the trial court and be subjected to cross-examination since the role of this appellate court is to re-examine the evidence adduced at the trial. Such new evidence cannot be raised at this stage, since by so doing, the appellant is stating his evidence at the appeal stage which is untenable. Therefore, I find no error on the part of the trial court in convicting the appellant for both counts.22.As to whether the sentences imposed are harsh and excessive, I note that the trial court imposed sentences prescribed in theSexual offences Act. The Supreme Court in the recent case ofRepublic v Mwangi; Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 others (Amicus Curiae) (Petition E018 of 2023) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR) stated that for as long as the sentences prescribed under section 8 of theSexual Offences Actremain undisturbed/constitutionally sound, the mandatory sentences ought to be applied as prescribed. It stated:“(66)We must also reaffirm that, although sentencing is an exercise of judicial discretion, it is Parliament and not the Judiciary that sets the parameters of sentencing for each crime in statute. As such, striking down a sentence provided for in Statute, must be based not only on evidence and sound legal principles but on an in-depth consideration of public interest and the principles of public law that informed the making of that specific law. A judicial decision of that nature cannot be based on private opinions, sentiments, sympathy or benevolence. It ought not to be arbitrary, whimsical or capricious.”23.With this in mind, the trial court did not err in sentencing the appellant to the statutory prescribed sentences for the 2 counts.24.In the end, I find that the appeal lacks merit and the same is hereby dismissed.25.It is so ordered.DELIVERED, DATED AND SIGNED AT EMBU THIS 27THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.L.

Background Of The Dispute4.The Tenant moved this tribunal vide a Reference and Notice of Motion Application dated 21stMay 2024 seeking for; the application to be certified urgent, that pending inter-partes hearing, the Landlords/Respondents by himself, agents be hereby restrained from unlawfully evicting, victimizing ,threatening, intimidation or any other way whatsoever interfering with the applicant’s/tenant’s quiet possession and use of the premises, that the verbal termination notice to terminate issued by the landlords be declared defective fatally flawed, misconceived and bad in law, that the landlords be temporarily restrained and prohibited from disturbing the quiet enjoyment of the business, that the landlords be temporarily restrained from disturbing the tenants quiet enjoyment of the business, that the Landlord be ordered to refund the KShs.62,575 used by the Tenant in renovations and that the OCS Likoni Police Station to assist in compliance of the orders.5.The Tribunal issued orders dated 27thMay 2024 allowing prayer 2 of the Tenant’s application that pending inter-partes hearing, the Landlords/Respondents by himself, agents be hereby restrained from unlawfully evicting, victimizing, threatening, intimidation or any other way whatsoever interfering with the applicant’s/tenant’s quiet possession and use of the premises.C. The Tenant’s Claim6.The tenant claims that the Landlord issued a verbal notice to terminate on 27thMay 2024.7.It is therefore the Tenant’s case that the Landlord’s action to issue a verbal termination notice is illegal and hindering the running of his business.D. List Of Issues For Determination8.I have carefully perused the material placed before this court by the parties and it is my considered opinion that the sole issue that falls for determination is:Whether the verbal termination notice issued by the landlords is valid? And if the said Susan was indeed a landlord?E. Analysis & DeterminationWhether the termination notice issued by the landlords is valid and if Susan is indeed a landlord?9.TheLandlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act(hereinafter ‘the Act’) Chapter 301 Laws of Kenya Act at section 4(2) provides that:A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or to alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under, such a tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form.10.In the case of Manaver N. Alibhai T/A Diani Boutique vs. South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited, Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was stated as follows;“The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in Form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”11.Section 7 of the Act provides for the grounds within which Landlord is allowed to issue a termination notice and at subsection (f) it provides as follows;Where under section 4 of this Act served a notice of termination of a controlled tenancy on the tenant, the grounds on which the landlord seeks to terminate such tenancy may be such of the following grounds as are stated in the aforesaid notice—That on the termination of the tenancy the landlord intends to demolish or reconstruct the premises comprised in the tenancy, or a substantial part thereof, or to carry out substantial work of construction on such premises or part thereof, and that he could not reasonably do so without obtaining possession of such premises;12.In this case, there is no Landlord/Tenant relationship between Susan and the Tenant and there is equally no evidence of payment receipts provided for the space being used by the Tenant which is on Susan’s property.13.Susan issued a verbal notice in relation to the space which was initially hers and only allowed partial usage when necessary to the Tenant, without pay. The Tenant therefore seems to have been trespassing and ought to stay on the portion leased between him and Patrick.14.The tribunal notes that the Tenant has claimed Kshs.62,575 for the renovations he’s done in the premises. There is however no documentation or evidence provided to support the claim therefore the tribunal is restrained on that basis in regards to determining the issue.I. Orders15.The upshot is that the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 7thFebruary 2024 are dismissed in the following terms;a.There is no Landlord/Tenant relationship between Susan and Anthony there is equally no evidence of payment receipts provided;b.The Tenant is a trespasser and ought to keep to leased space between him and Patrick;c.No orders as to costs.HON.

Parties And Representatives1.The Applicant, Hilda Fundi is the owner of the business premises located in Jomvu within Mombasa County the suit property (hence the Landlady).2.The applicant is acting in person.3.The Respondent, is the occupant of the suit property located in Jomvu within Mombasa County (hence the Tenant).4.The firm of Kitoo, Bosco & Associates Advocates is on record for the Respondent.B. Background Of The Dispute5.The Landlady moved this tribunal vide a Reference and Notice of Motion Application dated 4thJune 2024 seeking for; the application to be certified urgent, the tenant to be ordered to open the premises which he had superimposed a padlock and left, that pending the hearing of the application the tribunal to make orders for the tenant to settle the outstanding rent arrears for the months of December 2022 to May 2024 totaling to KShs.108,000.6.The Tribunal issued orders dated 4thJune 2024 and set the application for inter partes hearing on 28thJune 2024 as well as issuing orders for service to be effected.7.The tribunal upon hearing inter partes hearing on 25thJuly 2024 issued orders that the tenant reopens the premises immediately if he is the one who closed it which he denies, failure to which the Landlady will be at liberty to break in and take vacant possession and re-let the premises to another tenant with the assistance of the OCS Jomwa Police station. The tribunal then set a date for a ruling on rent arrears if any.C. The Landlady’s Claim8.The Landlady claims avers that the tenant locked the business premises using a padlock and left which has prevented the landlady from renting out the premises to other tenants.9.She further avers that the Tenant has not paid rent since December 2022 and is therefore in arrears of Kshs.108,000.10.It is therefore the Landlady’s case that the Tenant’s action to lock the premises is illegal and hindering the running of her business and that the rent arrears are detrimental to her business and livelihood.D. The Tenant’s Claim11.The Tenant claims that he had rented the premises to use during his campaigns in the year 2022 and that he vacated the premises and did not leave any padlock on the door.12.He further claims that he had been paying the agreed upon rent of KShs.6,000 per month and had informed the chairman of the welfare association managing premises as he was vacating.E. List Of Issues For Determination13.I have carefully perused the material placed before this court by the parties and it is my considered opinion that the following issues fall for determination:a.Whether the tenant should reopen the premisesb.Whether there are rent arrears owedH. Analysis & Determinationa.          Whether the tenant should reopen the premises14.The issue had been brought up in the Landlady’s application dated 4thJune 2024 where she claimed that the Tenant had superimposed a padlock on the premises and left. The tribunal addressed this issue and granted orders on 25thJuly 2024 for the tenant to reopen the premises if they placed the padlock which they deny, failure to which the landlady was at liberty to break into the premises and take vacant possession and re-let the premises to another tenant with the assistance of the OCS Jomwa Police station.b.            Whether there are rent arrears owed15.Section 107(1) of theEvidence actstates that;“Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.”16.The tribunal notes that the Landlady claims Kshs.108,000 in arrears but has not provided any evidence of payment or lack thereof such as a statement of accounts or bank statements to that effect.17.In line with Section 107 as quoted earlier and Section 109 of theEvidence Actwhich stipulates that;“The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person”,18.The Landlady has not provided any evidence proving that the Tenant is in arrears.19.Therefore, based on the above, it is this Tribunal’s view that the Landlady has failed to prove their case on the issue of arrears.20.It is also my considered opinion that the premises appears to have been used for campaigns in 2022 and fully paid for. It was thereafter handed over to one Lawrence who is known to the Landlady as she referred to him as a colleague.21.The Tenant and Landlady actually met for the first time in court as such any physical handover would have proofed difficult I therefore tend to belief the Tenants story that he handed over the premises to the Landlords agents and or one Lawrence a tenant cannot be penalized for a miscommunication between the Landlord and the agents on the ground and this Court therefore finds that there are no rent arrears owing as the premises were duly handed over.I. Orders22.The upshot is that the Landlady’s Reference and Application dated 4thJune 2024 are dismissed in the following terms;a.The Landlady to proceed as earlier ordered to take back the premises and re-let to another Tenant.b.No orders as to costs.HON.

      [2024] KEHC 10558 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at Nairobi (Milimani Law Courts)Insolvency Petition 14 of 2017FG Mugambi, JJuly 5, 2024CITATION: IN THE MATTER OF TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF KENYA STAFF RETIREMENT BENEFITS SCHEMEJudgmentBackground1.By a petition dated 25th September 2017 filed pursuant to section 5B & 11(4) of the Retirement Benefits (Minimum Funding Level and Winding-Up Schemes) Regulations 2000 and sections 423(1), 424(1) (e) and (g) of theInsolvency Act, the petitioner sought an order to wind up the respondent and for the appointment of the Official Receiver or an Insolvency Petitioner registered under theInsolvency Actas trustee. The petition was supported by the grounds on the face of it, an affidavit and further affidavit sworn by the petitioner.2.The petitioner notes that the respondent was placed under interim administration around 10th November 2015 for failure to comply with various mandatory provisions of theRetirement Benefits ActNo. 3 of 1997. This included the failure to meet the prescribed minimum funding level.3.At the end of the administration the interim administrator recommended the winding up of the respondent noting that the respondent was not sufficiently solvent to meet its liabilities when they became due especially liabilities to its members. The petitioner warned that the continued deduction of monies from the employees without remitting either the employee and employer contribution meant that the respondent’s debt continued to accrue every month and if the court did not wind up the respondent, the members of the respondent would be greatly prejudiced. Further the petitioner noted that the allegation that the government was willing to fund the scheme had remained illusory to date.4.The petitioner concurred with the recommendation of the interim administrator on similar grounds including the continued inability by the respondent to pay pension benefits to its members when they fell due; the continued financial difficulties experienced by the respondent’s sponsor who had failed in remitting pension contributions and the inability of the trustees of the respondent to manage it as a separate entity from the sponsor thereby creating a grave possibility of conflict of interest.5.The petitioner argued that in view of the circumstances, it would only be fair, just and equitable to wind up the respondent in order to mitigate against further damage and/or loss to the members of the respondent and to secure the interests of the members of the scheme.6.The respondent opposed the petition through a replying affidavit sworn on 13th April 2018 and a supplementary affidavit sworn on 1st July 2019 by RUTH KIRWA, the legal officer of Technical University of Kenya, the sponsor of the respondent.7.She averred that the scheme was placed under interim administration to ensure that it abides by the various statutory guidelines relating to its operations and not as a result of insolvency.8.The respondent argued that although it had been placed under temporary administration, the trustees of the respondent and the sponsor’s management were committed to ensuring the success of the respondent. This was evidenced by the remedial plan dated 17th February 2015.9.Referring to the said plan, the total outstanding contributions were Kshs.533,862,586/= and the sponsor had made monthly remittances to the scheme. As of December 2017, the sponsor had remitted a total sum of Kshs.195,745,515/= leaving an outstanding balance of Kshs.338,117,071/= only.10.The respondent pointed out that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology had partially approved the sponsor’s budget for a sum of Kshs.1,198,300,000/= and the sponsor was still pursuing the drawdown of the said funds.11.For these reasons the respondent was confident that the scheme was on its way to full recovery in a period of 12-24 months from the date of the affidavit based on the respondent’s funding levels and expected additional funding by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.12.In the circumstances, the respondent pleaded that the petition be dismissed or at the very least be suspended for 12 months to allow for the sponsor to demonstrate the viability and sustainability of the scheme.13.In this regard, the respondent swore a supplementary affidavit on 1st July 2019 confirming that the sponsor had embarked on the process of employing a corporate trustee who once appointed would run the respondent back to statutory compliance.Analysis and determination14.The petition was canvassed by way of written submissions which I have carefully considered together with the pleadings, authorities and evidence submitted by the parties. Section 5 of theRetirement Benefits ActCap 197 enlists the functions of the petitioner which include to:“(a)regulate and supervise the establishment and management of retirement benefits schemes;(b)protect the interests of members and sponsors of retirement benefits sector;”15.Further, the petitioner is empowered under regulation 5 of The Retirement Benefits (Minimum Funding Level and Winding up of Schemes) Regulations (the Regulations) to apply to the court for an order to wind up a retirement benefits scheme where the Authority is of the opinion that—“(a)a scheme is in such an unsound financial condition or its funding is below the minimum funding level and that arrangements by the trustees to improve the condition are ineffective, impracticable       or unsatisfactory; or(b)a scheme is in breach of section 28 (1) (a) and (c) of the Act;”16.The issue that this court must determine is whether the conditions under regulation 5 of the Regulations has been fulfilled. It is quite obvious that the respondent has financial liabilities. I further note that the respondent has not specifically controverted the petitioner’s submission and the quarterly reports by Zamara Actuaries, Administrators & Consultants Limited which indicate that as at December 2019, the respondent’s debt stood at Kshs.1,177,946,502/=.17.This amount had risen from Kshs.772,989,511/= as at 30th March 2016 when the interim administrator filed a report confirming this as the respondent’s total liabilities against the respondent’s assets valued at Kshs.133,598,732/=.18.The argument that the government was willing to fund the scheme has obviously not materialized for if this had happened the respondent would have provided the evidence of the same. This Court can only assume that the absence of such evidence means that the support has not materialized. The same case applies to the evidence of financial reprieve from the respondent’s sponsor. Therefore, as matters stand at this time, the debt has likely increased and there is no concrete rescue plan.19.What is of further concern to the Court is that the sponsor continues to collect contributions from its staff but does not remit the same to the respondent, further escalating the debt. This submission remains unopposed. The Court notes that the assets held by the respondent are significantly less than its liabilities and this points to a situation of insolvency.20.While the respondent submits that the scheme has continued to pay benefits to its members and it is therefore not insolvent, the Court notes that no evidence has been provided for such pay outs. The fact of the respondent’s escalating liability and financial distress is in fact admitted by the respondent who confirms having requested a budget of Kshs.1,198,300,000/= supposedly for the bailout, which had been presented for approval to the National Treasury.21.This arrangement, like the other bailout arrangements that have been outlined by the respondent remain unsatisfactory mainly due to the uncertainty, with no definitive timeline or assurance that the resources will be available.22.I say so noting that this petition was filed in 2017 and to date, the petitioner has not been able to remedy its financial distress. I note the efforts by the respondent and its sponsor in rescuing the respondent. I am however convinced that it would serve their best interest and the best interest of other stakeholders of the scheme to wind up the respondent so as to enable an orderly liquidation of assets and settlement of liabilities.Disposition23.Accordingly, I find merit in the petition dated 25th September 2017 and hereby grant an order winding up the respondent. The Official Receiver is hereby appointed as the Trustee/Liquidator.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED IN NAIROBI THIS 5TH DAY OF JULY 2024.F. MUGAMBI JUDGESIGNED BY: HON. LADY JUSTICE DR.

Petition No. E033 of 2024, had not lapsed thus prejudicing their right to adequately prepare their responses and any necessary cross- appeals; the consolidation order did not address or provide any guidance regarding the responses to the Petition of Appeal as consolidated; the deadline for    filing a response to S.C. Petition No. E033 of 2024would lapse on 30thAugust 2024 but, when the matter was mentioned before the Deputy Registrar of the Court, only 9 days had lapsed out of the 14 days allowed for an affected party to respond to an appeal; the Deputy Registrar’s directions, stating that the time for filing a response had lapsed, were in clear violation of Rule 42 of the Supreme Court Rules and blatantly disregarded the statutory timelines; the Court, having already granted conservatory orders, should not have had any legitimate reason, under the guise of urgency of the appeal, to curtail the parties’ right to fully prepare for the hearing of the appeal.3.They urge further that, based on the rules of computation of time as provided under Section 57 of theInterpretation and General Provisions Act(Cap.2) as read with Section 15 of the Supreme Court Rules, having filed and transmitted to the Registrar and served on all parties their Notice of Appeal, the deadline for the applicants to institute their appeal will lapse on 24thSeptember 2024, and therefore, it would be contrary to the Rules of the Court to lock them out while they are still within the timeline set for institution of appeals. That the issues raised in their Notice of Appeal are also unique in scope and have not been raised by the petitions already filed in this matter and they are apprehensive that should they later institute their petition of appeal, the Court will most likely want to consolidate it with the already consolidated ones, or should the Court proceed to determine the three petitions already filed, it may later decline to entertain their appeal. It would, in the circumstances, be just and expedient to hear all the appeals relating to the challenge of the Court of Appeal judgment, at once, rather than in instalments; and4.Upon reading the Replying Affidavit by the 1stand 2ndAppellant’s dated 3rdSeptember 2024 and sworn by Charles Hinga the Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Public works, Housing and Urban Development wherein he avers that they have complied with the directions issued by the Court on 20thAugust 2024; and that they understand the need to expedite the matters and the overbearing public    interest as well as the need for this Court to fully settle the issues raised in appeal as they are matters of national concern affecting revenue collection in the country. The 1stand 2ndAppellants also urge this Court to balance the rights of the applicants and respondents to a fair hearing vis-a-vis the need to expedite hearing of the consolidated Petitions; and5.Upon reading the submissions by Eliud Karanja Matindi, the 2ndRespondent herein, in support of the application and wherein he submits that allowing the application will ensure that the applicants have an opportunity to have their intended Petition of Appeal heard and determined on its merits. Conversely, a failure to grant the application will mean the intended appeal will be fatally compromised and the Applicants will have been condemned unheard. He anchors his submission on this Court’s decision in Deynes Muriithi & 4 Others v Law Society of Kenya & another [2016] eKLR where it was held that this Court has inherent jurisdiction to forestall an injustice, and in this context, the requirement that all parties are heard freely and fairly before a matter is concluded. The persuasive authority of the Court of Appeal in Judicial Service Commission v Mbalu Mutava & another [2015] eKLR is also cited in support of this submission, where the Court reaffirmed the position that the right to fair hearing under Article 50 (1) ofthe Constitutionas read with Article 25 cannot be limited; and6.Bearing in mind that this Court on 20thAugust 2024 issued orders which were to the effect that;“a.conservatory order is hereby issued suspending and staying the declarations in Orders iii, iv, vi, vii & ix (i) issued in the Court of Appeal Judgement dated 31stJuly, 2024 in Civil Appeals No. E003, E016, Eo21, E049, E064 & E080 of 2024 (Consolidated) pending the hearing and determination of the consolidated appeal;ii.the consolidated appeal be set down for mention before the Deputy Registrar of the Court for purposes of ensuring compliance with earlier directions on filings.iii.The consolidated appeals shall be set for hearing- virtually- on 10thand 11thSeptember 2024 at 9 a.m. each day”.7.Subsequent to the above orders, the Deputy Registrar of this Court, on 23rdAugust 2024, issued orders directing the parties to file their responses and cross- appeals in line with Order iii above and in the aforesaid directions, the Deputy Registrar declined to offer any advice to the applicants herein in relation to their notice of appeal upon considering the fact that the consolidated appeal had already been fixed for hearing on 10thand 11thSeptember 2024. The said directions triggered the filing of the present Motion and with the above background in mind;8.We now opine and determine as follows;i.Under Section 21 A of theSupreme Court Actas read with Rule 28 (5) of the Supreme Court Rules, and the guiding principles in Fredrick Otieno Outa vs Jared Odoyo Okello & 3 Others S.C. Petition No. 6 of 2014[2017] eKLR this Court, may, upon application by a party, or on its own motion, review its own decision where: (a) the judgment, ruling, or order, was obtained, by fraud, deceit or misrepresentation of facts; (b) the judgment, ruling, or order, is a nullity by virtue of being made by a court which was not competent; (c) the Court was misled into giving judgment, ruling or order, under a belief that the parties had consented to the same; or (d) the judgment, ruling or order was rendered, on the basis of a repealed law, or as a result of a deliberate concealment of a statutory provision; andii.Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules provides for the scope and objectives of the Supreme Court Rules and Rule 3 (5) specifically provides that;“(5)Nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make such orders or give such directions as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court”.This Rule is pertinent and applicable to the present Motion for reasons to be detailed out below.iii.In the above context, this Court, in issuing its directions dated 20thAugust 2024, was cognisant of the time of filing of respective pleadings as anchored in Part IV of the Supreme Court Rules. Amongst the considerations made by the Court in fast tracking the matter is the public interest involved in the consolidated appeal and the fact that the Finance Act is a time bound statute. Indeed, in paragraph 20 of its decision the Court stated;“...Furthermore, balancing the loss and uncertainty which would be occasioned to the applicants as against the loss by the respondents and public, we find that public interest tilts in favour of granting conservatory and stay orders to preserve the substratum of the consolidated appeal and maintain stability in the budget and appropriation process pending the determination of this appeal. In addition, in view of the public interest in the matter, we direct that the consolidated appeal herein be set down for hearing within the shortest time possible after the delivery of this ruling.” [Emphasis added]iv.The subsequent directions by the Deputy Registrar dated 23rdAugust 2024 are therefore in conformity with the Ruling dated 20thAugust 2024 and we note that all parties including the applicants have partly complied with the said directions.v.Noting the Fredrick Outa decision and Rules 21A and 28(5) aforesaid, the applicants have not shown how the impugned directions were a nullity,    or were obtained, by fraud, deceit or misrepresentation of facts. We also find that the applicants had, from the date of the Court of Appeal judgement i.e. 31stJuly 2024, sufficient time to file their appeal especially because of the public interest, sensitivity and urgency of the matters in dispute. The fact that the appellants filed their appeals with the said urgency and have complied with all the directions issued by this Court as have the applicants, means that the applicants could have similarly done so but for their own indolence.vi.The applicants’ plea that they are within the time for filing their appeal is negated by the fact that this Court has inherent jurisdiction to make such orders as would meet the ends of justice, the timelines set out in the Rules notwithstanding. We have also not been shown how our directions are capricious or injudicious.vii.It will be prejudicial to the appellants herein and all the close to fifty (50) other affected parties to allow the filing of a subsequent appeal in this matter at this stage as none has raised any issue with the fast tracking of the hearing of the consolidated appeal save the 2ndRespondent and for reasons set out above.viii.We further note that the issues raised by the applicants in their Notice of Appeal have already been canvassed by other parties in the consolidated appeal; for example, the 15th, 16th, 17th18thand 19threspondents’ cross appeal advances the argument that the Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to hold that the Act is a Bill concerning county governments and that the lack of concurrence between the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the National Assembly before the introduction of the Finance Bill vitiated the constitutionality of the Act. We also note that the pith and substance test alongside all other related issues raised in the Notice of    Appeal filed by the applicants on 20thAugust 2024 can be addressed in submissions as a matter of law without the filing of a fresh appeal. The only other issue that we see in the said Notice relevant to this Ruling is the question whether the Court of Appeal failed to grant appropriate reliefs pursuant to Articles 2(4) and 23(3) ofthe Constitution. Again, that issue is already germane to the determination of the consolidated appeal and we said so in our Ruling under attack. In effect, none of the five (5) issues in the applicants’ Notice of Appeal fall outside the existing appeal to warrant the filing of a separate appeal and in any event they all arise from the same judgment of the Court of Appeal that the appellants have challenged and can be raised in the context of submissions already filed by the parties.ix.In view of the foregoing we, find that the application does not fall within the parameters for review in the Fredrick Otieno Outa Case as set out above and must be therefore be dismissed.x.On costs, award of the same is discretionary and follows the principle set out by this Court in Jasbir Singh Rai & 3 other v. Tarlochan SinghRai & 4 others SC Petition No 4 of 2012; [2014] eKLR that costs follow the event and that the Court may in appropriate cases exercise discretion and decide otherwise. We find that the application was not superfluous and that the applicants were endeavoring to exhaust every remedy to ventilate their case. In the circumstance, it will not serve the ends of justice to condemn the applicants to pay costs of the application.7.Consequently and for the reasons afore-stated, we make the following Orders:i.The Notice of Motion dated 29thAugust 2024 and filed on 30thAugust 2024 is hereby dismissed; andii.There shall be no order as to costs.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 5THDAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.………………………………………………………….M.

Introduction1.In a judgment delivered on 16thMarch, 2023 the court in found favour of the claimant and made the following orders-a.A declaration be and is hereby issued that the dismissal of the claimant by the respondent was wrongful and unlawful.b.The claimant is awarded a total of Kshs2,123,736/= together with interest thereon from the date of this judgment less statutory deductions. The said sum is made of-i.Balance of salary for the month of          September, 2017…… Kshs164,571/=ii.Three months gross wage in    lieu of notice………… Kshs393,633/=iii.Compensation for wrongful and     unlawful dismissal equivalent to     12 months gross salary………Kshs1,574, 532/=Total…………………………... Kshs2,132,736/=This amount is subject to statutory deductions.c.All the other claims are denied.d.The claimant is awarded costs of this cause.e.The respondent is ordered to issue and deliver to the claimant a certificate of service within 30 days of this judgment.2.In a notice of motion dated 15thDecember, 2023 (the application) filed under a certificate of urgency through Kiplenge, Andama & Makau Advocates the respondent (the applicant) is seeking the following:-1.Spent2.That this Honourable Court be pleased to order a stay of execution of the judgment delivered in this suit on the 16thMarch, 2023 and rectified on the 23rdMarch, 2023 pending the hearing and determining of this application.3.That this Honourable Court be pleased to order a stay of execution of the judgment delivered in this suit on the 16thMarch, 2023 and rectified on 23rdMarch, 2023 pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal against the said judgment.4.That the costs of this application be provided for.3.The application is expressed to be brought under Order 42 rule 6, Order 51 rule 1 and Order 63 of the Civil Procedure Rules, section 3A of theCivil Procedure Act.4.The application is based on the grounds on the face of it and supported with the affidavit of Mutai K. Owen, the advocate for the respondent, sworn on even date, with several annexures thereto.5.In opposition to the application, the claimant filed grounds of opposition dated 18thJanuary, 2024 through Raydon Mwangi & Associates stating that the same is an abuse of the court process, and a delaying tactic and thus it should be struck out with costs.6.On 7thFebruary, 2024, the court directed that the application be canvassed by way of written submissions and granted stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the application. Mr. Mutai, counsel for the respondent, filed his submissions on 21stFebruary, 2024, while counsel for the claimant did not file any written submissions.II. Analysisa.      The respondent’s supporting affidavit7.In summary, the respondent is seeking a stay of execution of the judgment and the decree arising from the orders alluded to in the introductory part of this ruling.8.It is deposed that on 23rdMarch, 2023 this Honourable Court proceeded suo moto under Rule 34 of the Employment and Labour Relations Court Rules, 2016 and rectified an arithmetical error in the decretal sum reducing the same to Kshs1,977,407.20/=.9.Thereafter, the respondent lodged a notice of appeal. However, the claimant filed an application in the Court of Appeal in Nakuru Civil Appeal No. E037 of 2023 praying that notice of appeal to be struck out.10.In a ruling delivered on 8thDecember, 2023, the Court of Appeal ruled that the notice of appeal was not served upon the claimant within seven days as per Rule 79(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules and the same was struck out. The respondent filed an application under Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules seeking for extension of time to lodge another notice of appeal against the judgment in Nakuru Civil Application No. E114 of 2023. As far as the evidence shows the application is still pending hearing and determination.11.It is deposed that the intended appeal against the judgment raises triable issues and that since there is no stay of execution against the said judgment, execution may be effected thus rendering the intended appeal nugatory. Further, it is deposed that the intended appeal is arguable and has high chances of success. It is further deposed that the respondent is willing to abide by any terms for stay of execution that the court may set.b.      The grounds of opposition12.In the grounds of opposition dated 18thJanuary, 2024, the claimant (the respondent in the application) is opposed to the application on the following grounds -1.That the application is a non-starter, having no legal foundation whatsoever -2.That the application is legless and expressly violates the mandatory provisions of Order 42 rule 6(4) of the Civil Procedure since it is not based on a Notice of Appeal.3.That the court is functus officio having delivered its judgment and there is no valid appeal or pending application for review against its decision.4.That In any case the application is an abuse of the court process being a delaying tactic aimed at prolonging litigation and should be struck out with the costs.c.      Submissions by the respondent’s counsel13.On the one hand, counsel for the respondent raised two issues for determination as follows - Whether the instant application satisfies the requirement for the grant of an order for stay of execution of the judgment; and, Who should bear the costs of the application.14.Counsel cited the Court of Appeal in Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal [1979] eKLR where it was held that the court has discretionary powers to grant or decline stay of execution. Counsel also cited RWW V EKW [2019] eKLR where the court highlighted the purpose of a stay for execution pending appeal.15.Counsel cited Order 42 rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides for the factors to be considered in an application for a stay of execution as follows -(2)No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—(a)the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and(b)such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.16.On the issue of substantial loss, it is submitted that the respondent stands to suffer substantially in the event that execution is enforced. It is submitted that if execution is allowed to proceed and the decretal sum is paid to the claimant and the appeal ultimately succeeds, the claimant will not be in a financial position to refund the decretal sum. It is further submitted that failure to grant the stay the execution will render the appeal nugatory and a mere academic exercise. Counsel cited Nicholas Stephen Okaka & Another V Alfred Waga Wesonga (2022) eKLR in support of that position.17.Counsel argues that the draft memorandum of appeal raises triable issues defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary as “subject or liable to judicial examination and trial”. Counsel also cited Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui vs Tony Ketter & 5 others [2013] eKLR wherein an arguable appeal was described as not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court and which is not frivolous.18.On the issue of unreasonable delay, it is submitted that there was an application dated 13thDecember, 2023 seeking for extension of time to lodge the notice of appeal after the initial notice of appeal was struck out by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal (application) No. E037 of 2023.19.On the issue of security, it is submitted that the respondent is willing to comply with the conditions as may be set by the court and it has been proposed that the decretal sum be deposited in a joint interest-earning account in the names of the advocates for both parties.20.On the issue of costs, counsel relied on Republic V Rosemary Wairimu Munene, ex-parte application V Ihururu Dairy Farmers Co-operative Society Ltd submitting that the application be allowed with costs.III. Determination21.The court has perused and considered the application, the grounds of opposition, and the written submissions filed by counsel for the respondent. The court identifies two issues for determination –a.Whether the stay of execution should be granted,b.Who should bear the costs of the application.22.Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules provides for the conditions for granting stay of execution to be –Whether there will be substantial loss on the part of the applicant; Whether the application has been filed or made without unreasonable delay; and, Whether the security for costs in the due performance of the decree or order has been provided for or an undertaking to comply with any orders that the court may issue.23.In Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal [1979] eKLR the Court of Appeal held that a court has discretionary powers in granting or declining an application for stay of execution.24.On the issue of substantial loss, the respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent stands to suffer substantial loss if the stay is not granted in that the claimant has not demonstrated that she is capable of repaying the decretal sum in case the appeal ultimately succeeds.25.In James Wangalwa & Another V Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR the court held that execution does not automatically amount to substantial loss under Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, and the applicant should prove that the execution shall irreparably affect or negate the applicant’s core as the successful party in the appeal. In any event, a successful litigant is entitled to the fruits of a judgment.26.On the issue of unreasonable delay, the court notes that the application in Civil Appeal No. E037 of 2023 was struck out by the Court of Appeal and this court is of the view that the application for extension of time in Civil Appeal No. E114 of 2023 is just a delaying tactic to prevent the claimant from enjoying the fruits of a lawful judgment. There is no appeal pending hearing and determination.27.If there is no appeal pending hearing what would an order for stay be pending?28.The respondent has not satisfied the conditions for stay of execution as set out in Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules thus the application lacks merits and the same is hereby dismissed. An order for stay of execution shall be synonymous to this court sitting on appeal of its own orders. There is no appeal pending and this court is functus officio in the matter having pronounced itself in the impugned judgment.29.The court agrees with the claimant that the application has been filed in bad faith and the same amounts to abuse of court process.IV. Costs30.The application is dismissed with costs to the claimant.V. Orders31.For all the foregoing reasons, the notice of motion dated 15thDecember, 2023 by the respondent lacks merits and the same is hereby dismissed with costs to the claimant.DELIVERED VIRTUALLY, DATED, AND SIGNED AT NAKURU  THIS 4THDAY OF JULY, 2024..............................DAVID NDERITUJUDGE",Chelagat v Kabarak University (Cause 28 of 2020) [2024] KEELRC 2178 (KLR) (4 July 2024) (Ruling),Cause 28 of 2020,"DN Nderitu, J","July 4, 2024",

Parties And Their Representatives1.The Applicants, (the “Tenants”) are the lawful tenants of shops on property known as Title Number MSA/Block XXII/186 situated along Archbishop Makarios Road on Mombasa Island within Mombasa County (the “suit premises”).2.The Firm of Michael Ngure and Co. Advocates represents the Tenants in this matter.3.The 1stRespondent, Engroup (K) International Limited is the registered proprietor of the suit premises and hence the Landlord (the “Landlord”).4.The 2ndRespondent, Sure Auctioneers, have been instructed to distress for rent and hence are agents of the Landlord.5.The firm of Addulrahman, Saad, & Associates Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.B. Background Of The Dispute6.Vide a ruling delivered by Hon. P. May delivered a ruling on 10thSeptember 2021 dismissing the Tenants’ References dated 15thDecember 2020 and Applications dated 21stMay 2021 and validating the Landlord’s notice of alteration of terms seeking to increase rent from KShs. 10,000.00 to KShs. 50,000.00.7.Dissatisfied with this decision, the Tenants filed an appeal at the Environment and Land Court in Civil Appeal E059 of 2021: Mohammed Alwly & David Ngure Kienjeku v. EN Group (K) International Limited where Naikuni J. allowed the appeal by setting aside the ruling of this Court dated 10thSeptember 2021 and directing that this Court supervises the Parties’ deliberations on a fair, reasonable and equitable rental increment based on the current market rate and that the matter be mentioned on 18thJanuary 2024.8.When the matter was mentioned on 17thJuly 2024, the Tenants’ Advocate, Mr. Omboga, submitted that Naikuni J. advised that the rent payable be reviewed by an independent valuer. Further, he noted that Gazette Notice No. 89 had been published indicating the compulsory acquisition of the suit premises by Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and the National Land Commission (NLC).9.The Court directed that the matter be mentioned on 26thJuly 2024 for further directions on valuation reports and for the Tenants’ Advocate to give an update on the gazette notice for demolition of the suit premises as well as supply the Court with ELC decision in Civil Appeal No. E059 of 2024.10.As in all mediation cases which this was for all purposes intended to be by the High Court Judge to find a middle ground parties seem to have stood firm on their grounds and unwilling to negotiate. In the circumstances the Tribunal guided by the High Court ruling instructed parties to file submissions on their respective valuation reports as parties again placed reliance on their old reports and were not willing to file fresh ones.11.Subsequently, the Tenants filed their submissions dated 30thJuly 2024 and the Landlord filed its submissions on 1stAugust 2024.C. Tenant’s Case12.The Tenants submit that while the parties are willing to deliberate on the rent payable, major changes affecting the landlord-tenant relationship were currently underway because the suit premises was to be demolished as per Gazette Notice Number 15192 and Gazette Number 89 dated 2ndDecember 2024 and 10thJune 2024 respectively.D. Landlords’ Case13.The Landlord submits that its valuation report dated 13thOctober 2021 has merit and that the rent proposed was based on comparable along Archbishop Makarios road and factored in inflation affecting the country in totality.14.The Landlord further submits that since this matter was filed in Court, the Tenant has not made any rent payment and maliciously kept writing cheques in a different name other than that of the respondent, making it difficult for the Landlord to cash them out.15.The Landlord therefore prays that the Tenant be ordered to pay the rent arrears from December 2020 when this suit began to date and that the cheques be written in the Landlord’s name.E. Jurisdiction16.The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.F. List For Issues For Determination17.Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the issues that falls for determination are:a.What is the rent payable by the Tenants?b.Whether the Landlord is entitled to the rent arrears?G. Analysis And DeterminationWhat is the rent payable by the Tenants18.I note that the Environment and Land Court in setting aside the decision of the Tribunal directed that parties should be deliberate on a reasonable, fair and equitable amount of rent and advised that valuation be done by an independent valuer.19.However, there has been developments of impending demolition of the suit premises in light to two gazette notices produced by the Tenants listing the suit premises as part of land to be compulsorily acquired by the Government for the construction of the Mombasa gate bridge project.20.As rightly submitted by the Tenants, the aforementioned developments will ultimately have the effect of terminating the subsisting landlord tenant relationship in the near future, which may be by January 2025.21.Be that as it may, these events do not negate the Tenant’s obligation to pay rent. This Tribunal has a duty to ensure that justice is not only done but must be seen to be done. Besides, it is an implied condition of every lease that the tenant pays rent as and when it falls due, unless the Court directs otherwise.22.It therefore would be improper to allow the Tenants to get away with the nonpayment of rent which the Landlord alleges is for the period since this suit commenced, to date.23.The Tenants have not placed sufficient material before this Tribunal to demonstrate that they have been paying rent, even at the rate of Kshs. 4,500.00 and KShs. 10,000.00, the prevailing rate before issuance of the notice by the Landlord to increase the rent despite being in occupation of the suit premises.24.It is noteworthy that the valuation reports filed by the Parties herein indicate that the rate of Kshs. 4,500.00 and KShs. 10,000.00 is significantly low. The Tenant’s valuation report indicates that the rent payable as at 2021 is KShs. 24,000 while the Landlord’s Report indicates a rate of KShs. 40,000.25.Going by the Tenant’s valuation report, I note that two years have lapsed and the rent payable must be increased to reflect the current value of the property. Further, I note that the Valuer has not taken into consideration the service charge as well as Value Added Tax at the rate of 16%.26.In the circumstances, I am convinced that the rate of KShs. 24,000.00 ought to be increased by 10% after every two years to KShs. 26,400 per month and a service charge of KShs. 5,000.00. Additionally, VAT at a rate of 16% mut be added thereto to amount to KShs. 36, 424. 00.27.Accordingly, I find the amount payable as rent to be KShs. 36, 424.00 which ought to have been paid since August 2021.H. Orders28.In the upshot the following Orders shall abide;a.The Tenants to pay any outstanding rent arrears of KShs. 1,347,688.00 within 14 days of the date hereof, failure to which the Landlord shall be entitled to levy distress for rent and to take back vacant possession with the assistance of OCS Central police Station, Mombasa; and the same shall be payable in the landlords name Engroup International Limitedb.Tenant to keep paying rent at the rate of KShs. 36,424.00 and when it falls due until the process of compulsory acquisition is complete;c.Each party to bear their own costs.HON A.

      [2024] KEHC 10557 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at BusiaCivil Case E001 of 2024WM Musyoka, JSeptember 5, 2024BetweenPaul Caleb AjibaPlaintiffandDr Stephen Wandefu ManyaDefendantRuling1.The plaintiff is a communicant or parishioner, or, in the Kenyan parlance, member, of the ACK St. Barnabas Esikura Lugulu Parish, while the defendant is the Vicar in charge of St. Stephen ACK Parish in Nambale Diocese. In his suit, the plaintiff avers that the defendant was not properly appointed to his office, given that he previously served with the Mumias Diocese, and the Bishop for that Diocese did not release him, for transfer to the Nambale Diocese, to take charge of St. Stephen ACK Parish. He invites the court, in his plaint, for a declaration that the due process was not followed for the said transfer, and the appointment of the defendant, to his current position, was, therefore, not procedural, and that he was illegally in office.2.The plaint was filed simultaneously with a Motion, dated 22ndJanuary 2024, seeking that an order issues to restrain the defendant, or his agents, from conducting the affairs of St. Stephen’s ACK Parish, Nambale Diocese, on grounds that the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese had not released him for appointment as Vicar for the St Stephen’s Parish in Nambale. He argues that the defendant transferred himself to the said Parish, without the knowledge of the Mumias Bishop.3.The defendant reacted to that application, by an affidavit he swore on 5thFebruary 2024. He asserts that he is the Vicar-General for the Diocese of Nambale, serving at the St. Stephen’s Church, on appointment by the Bishop of Nambale. He further states that, following the appointment, he was duly installed as such, in a ceremony that was conducted by the Bishop of Nambale Diocese, on 21stFebruary 2024. He avers that he did serve at the Mumias Diocese, up to 2005, after which he left for further studies, in Nairobi, at Daystar University. He explains that, while studying at Daystar University, he was appointed, by the Bishop of the All Saints Cathedral Diocese, Nairobi, to serve at the St. Joseph Parish at Kabete. He also taught at Daystar University and Alupe University, and it was from the latter that he was appointed the Vicar-General. He complains that the suit herein is an attempt to scuttle his intention to vie for the position of Bishop of the Nambale Diocese.4.In a further affidavit, sworn on 14thFebruary 2024, the defendant avers that the Church has a constitution, which regulates the matters in dispute, and which provides for an internal dispute resolution mechanism, which the plaintiff has not exhausted. A copy of that constitution is attached.5.I gave directions, on 24thApril 2024, for canvassing of the said application, by way of written submissions. The only written submissions that I see in the record before me are by the defendant. He argues around the principles for grant of injunctive relief, and asserts that the threshold has not been met. He cites Giella vs. Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd [1973] EA 358 (Sir William Duffus P, Spry VP & Law JA), Mrao Ltd vs. First American Bank of Kenya Ltd [2003] eKLR (Kwach, Bosire & O’Kubasu, JJA), Kitur & another vs. Standard Chartered Bank & 2 others [2002] eKLR (Tunya, J), Pius Kipchirchir Kogo vs. Frank Kimeli Tenai [2018] eKLR (Ombwayo, J) and Showind Industries vs. Guardian Bank Limited & another [2002] eKLR (Ringera, J).6.The above decisions state the law, with respect to what should be established, for the purpose of persuading a court to grant the relief sought in the instant application. Has the threshold been met? I do not think so. There are several reasons.7.In the first place, I doubt that the plaintiff has any locus to bring a civil suit of this nature against the defendant. It turns on Church affairs. The plaintiff is not in a position of leadership within the Church, and he appears to have brought the suit in his personal capacity. The wrong, that he complains of, does not affect him as a person. He does not come from the same Parish with the defendant, according to his papers, and he has not attempted to explain why he would be aggrieved. The defendant was allegedly appointed the Vicar of the St. Stephen’s Parish, the plaintiff is from St. Barnabas Parish. What business does he have complaining about what goes on at St Stephen’s? How does it affect him? What loss would he personally suffer should the appointment remain in place? With profound respect to the plaintiff, the space or position from which he is prosecuting this suit projects him as a busy-body.8.In the second place, the plaint, as framed, as I understand it, is presenting a case in public interest, and, therefore, the plaintiff is suing the defendant in public interest. However, suits of that nature only work best in the realm of public law, against State entities, where Judicial Review, constitutional petitions and fair administration action suits are permissible. The Church is not in that space. It is not a State organ or entity, and public interest litigation is not suitable to agitate claims against it, or its officials.9.In the third place, the plaintiff is asserting that the defendant was serving under the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese, and could not transfer his services from the Mumias Diocese to another diocese, or accept appointment by another diocese, without being released or permitted to do so by the Bishop of Mumias. The plaintiff has not provided material to demonstrate that he is the official mouthpiece of the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese, or that he has the authority of that Bishop to pursue the case on his behalf. There is no proof that the said Bishop is aggrieved about the defendant, and even if he was, there is nothing to show that he has authorised the plaintiff to bring the suit, to articulate his grievance.10.In the fourth place, the Church is not personal property, where the plaintiff would have proprietary rights, neither is it a firm, where members or adherents would have shares, which would provide basis for litigation in the manner of the instant suit. The Church is a society, where the plaintiff would have interests, as opposed to rights. Courts are generally shy about entertaining suits over societal interests, given that such societies would have rules under which they play by, and it would be expected that any disputes would be resolved within those rules. The plaintiff would like the court to declare that due process was not followed in the appointment and transfer of the defendant, and that would presuppose that a certain process had been provided for such transfer and appointment, yet the plaintiff has not pointed at any rule or regulation that ought to have governed such transfer and appointment.11.In the fifth place, and related to the fourth, the Church, being a society, ought to be governed by certain rules, often referred to as a constitution, which regulates conduct of its affairs, and sets out how any differences and disputes, between members of the society, or between the members and the leadership, ought to be resolved. These are what are commonly known as internal dispute resolution mechanisms. The defendant has stated that the Church does have a constitution, and he has availed a copy, which provides for an internal dispute resolution mechanism, and has argued that the plaintiff did not exploit that mechanism before rushing to court. I have perused that constitution, and I have noted those mechanisms. The business or affairs of the Church should be run by the Church itself, and not the State, whether through the Executive or the courts. State intervention would be only in extreme cases, where there would be violation of the law, or breakdown of law and order, or a serious threat to those. The State trusts that the Church is capable of taking care of its own affairs, and intervenes only where it is established that the Church has failed in that regard. A member of a Church, who is aggrieved by anything that happens within the Church, is expected to raise the matter internally, and to seek to have it resolved within the internal Church structures, and should only approach the court where he has exhausted those mechanisms, or where the processes are carried out in violation of the law. The plaintiff has not demonstrated that he exploited the internal mechanisms established by the Church, without success, or the Church mechanisms operated in breach of the law relating to due process and fair hearing, or that he did not expect to get justice in that process.12.In the sixth and final place, the issue raised appears to touch on employment and labour relations. It is about an employee of the Church being appointed, and transferred. The High Court has no jurisdiction to address employment and labour relations issues. Whether a person is properly appointed to a position within an organisation, or society, such as a Church, and whether he is properly transferred from one station of work to another, within the organisation, is a matter of employment. Under Article 162(2) ofthe Constitutionof Kenya, promulgated in 2010, that jurisdiction lies with a court envisaged by that Article, which court was established by Parliament, in 2011, and designated the Employment and Labour Relations Court.The Constitutionemphatically states, at Article 165(5) ofthe Constitution, that the High Court shall not exercise jurisdiction over any of the matters reserved for the courts contemplated under Article 162(2). The High Court can only exercise jurisdiction, to a very limited extent, where the constitutional issue raised is framed under Article 165(3) ofthe Constitution, and the same is not exclusively an employment issue.13.I do not think I should belabour the issue. I am not persuaded that a prima facie case, with probability of success, exists.  As indicated above, there is nothing to show that the plaintiff would stand to suffer damage of any kind, should the orders not be granted, for he has no personal interest in the matter, and the instant suit does not fall within the rubric of public litigation. There is no merit in the application, dated 22ndJanuary 2024, therefore, and I hereby dismiss it, with costs to the defendant. It is so ordered.DELIVERED VIA EMAIL, DATED AND SIGNED IN CHAMBERS, AT BUSIA, THIS 5thDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024.W MUSYOKAJUDGEMr. Arthur Etyang, Court Assistant.AdvocatesMs. Amani, instructed by SK Amani & Associates, Advocates for the plaintiff.Mr. Bogonko, instructed by Bogonko Otanga & Company, Advocates for the defendant.",Ajiba v Manya (Civil Case E001 of 2024) [2024] KEHC 10557 (KLR) (5 September 2024) (Ruling),Civil Case E001 of 2024,"WM Musyoka, J","September 5, 2024",

Parties And Their Representatives1.The Landlord, Adan Sharif, (the “Landlord”) is the lawful owner of Shop 1 & 2 erected on Plot No. 330 Block of Volcano Association, Ardhi river, within Machakos County (the “suit premises”).2.The Firm of Ibrahim, Issack & Company Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.3.The Tenant, Charles Nichodemus (the “Tenant”), is the tenant occupying the suit premises.4.The firm of Mukami Njeru & Associates represents the Landlord in this matter.B. Background Of The Dispute5.Through a Reference and an Application dated 23rdMay 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Landlord moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders inter-alia: orders certifying the matter as urgent, evicting the Tenant from the suit premises and compelling the Tenant to clear all outstanding liabilities on their account in respect of electricity, water, generator fuel and maintenance in the sum of KShs. 20,000.00.6.Upon perusal of the Application, this Honourable Tribunal on 28thMay 2024 directed that the Landlord to serve the Application and Reference for hearing on 24thJune 2024 and subsequently file an affidavit of service.7.In response to the Tenant’s Application, the Tenant filed a Replying Affidavit dated 11thJuly 2024.8.The Landlord filed submissions in support of his Reference and Application dated 19thJuly 2024 and the Tenant subsequently filed his submissions dated 2ndAugust 2024.9.It is the Landlord’s Reference and Application dated 23rdMay 2024 that is the subject of this ruling.C. Landlors’s Case10.The Landlord avers that he served the Tenant with a notice to vacate dated 15thApril 2024 on the basis that the Tenant was making irregular rent payments which had led him to be in arrears of KShs. 20,000.00.11.Further, the Landlord submits that the Tenant had continuously breached other terms of the tenancyD. Tenant’s Case12.The Tenant avers that the Landlord’s notice to vacate does not comply with the requirements espoused under Section 4(2) of Cap 301 and is therefore invalid.13.It is the Tenant’s case that the Landlord intends to let the suit premises to another tenant and has attached correspondence to that effect.E. Jurisdiction14.The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.F. Issues For Determination15.Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the sole issue that falls for determination is;Whether the orders sought by the Landlord should be grantedG. Analysis And Determination16.The powers of the Business Premises Rent Tribunal are provided by the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter the Act). Section 12(1)(i) of the Act provides that:4.“In addition to any other powers specifically conferred on it by or under this Act, a Tribunal may investigate any complaint relating to a controlled tenancy made to it by the landlord or the tenant, and may make such order thereon as it deems fit.”17.This Tribunal notes the parties herein entered into an oral tenancy agreement which amounts to a controlled tenancy that is subject to the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court and whose termination should be in compliance with Section 4 (2) of Cap 301 which provides:“A Landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy or to alter to the detriment of the Tenant any term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the Tenant under such a tenancy shall give notice in that behalf to the Tenant in the prescribed form.”18.Further, Section 4 (4) of Cap 301 provides that:“No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party, as shall be specified therein:Provided that—ii.where the terms and conditions of a controlled tenancy provide for a period of notice exceeding two months, that period shall be substituted for the said period of two months after the receipt of the tenancy notice;19.I have perused the notice of termination dated 15thApril 2024 issued by the Landlord. I note that the notice lacks form as the same is a letter as opposed to the prescribed form under Cap 301.20.Additionally, the notice lacks substance for the reasons that; it provides for a termination period of 28 days as opposed to the two months’ notice period and it does not require the Tenant to respond in writing indicating whether or not he is willing to comply with the notice. convinced that the same falls short of the requirements of Section 4 of Cap 301.21.In the circumstances, I find that the notice of termination dated 15thApril 2024 falls short of the requirements for termination of a controlled tenancy under Section 4 and hence, is invalid.22.Be that as it may, I note that the Tenant has been making irregular rent payments and has not paid rent for several months as per the Landlord’s Mpesa statements dated 6thMay 2024 accumulating arrears in the sum of KShs. 40,000.00. It is an implied term of every tenancy that the Tenant pays rent as agreed by the parties to the tenancy.F. Orders23.In the upshot the Landlord’s Reference and Application dated 23rdMay 2024 are hereby partially allowed in the following terms;a.The Tenant to clear any outstanding arrears within 14 days failure to which the Landlord shall be at liberty to distress for rent;b.The tenant to pay rent on or before the 10thof every month without fail, failure to which the Landlord will be at liberty to distress and take back vacant possession with the Assistance of OCS Athiriver police station.c.The Landlord is at liberty to issue a fresh notice; andd.Each party to bear their own costs.HON A.

Parties And Their Representatives1.The Respondent/Applicant, Boniface Kamande Kinyanjui, instituted this suit (hereinafter known as the “Applicant”).2.The Applicant is represented by the Firm of Mwaura Kelvin Karuga & Associates Advocates.3.The Tenant/Respondent, Patrick Muiruri Kamau, is the Tenant of a rented business space known as Victory Choma Roast (hereinafter known as the “Tenant”).4.The Tenant is represented by the Firm of Daniel Henry & Company Advocates.B. Dispute Background5.This Honourable Tribunal vide a Ruling dated 17th January 2023 made Orders inter alia:I.Status quo be maintained and the Tenant to continue paying rent to the Interested Party, the Landlord of the premises as per the Lease Agreement entered into by the two parties.II.The Respondent to cater for the losses incurred by the Applicant as a result of the illegal closure of the business premises contrary to CAP 301 assessed at KShs.90,000 within 30 days.III.The Respondent to cover the Applicant’s costs of the suit assessed at KShs.10,000.6.Subsequently, the Applicant filed a Notice of Motion Application dated 23rd January 2024 seeking orders inter alia that this Tribunal be pleased to set aside and /or quash the Judgment dated 17th January 2023 pending the hearing and determination of this application.7.It is this application that is the subject of this Ruling.C. The Applicant’s Claim8.The Applicant contends that the Ruling was rendered in his absence, as the law firm of M/S Solomon Mugo & Co. Advocates, whom he had instructed to represent him, failed to act despite being provided with the mention and hearing notices.9.Furthermore, he asserts that the failure of his advocates to act led to an unfavourable Ruling which ordered that he must pay the Tenant Kshs.90,000 as damages for the closure of the business premises and Kshs.10,000 as costs of the suit.10.He maintains that the issuance of the Ruling occurred without his participation contrary to the principles of natural justice.11.The Applicant avers that the execution of the Ruling and any resulting Decree would result in irreparable loss, injury, and damage to him.12.Additionally, he avers that the errors of his counsel should not be attributed to him as an innocent litigant.D. The Tenant’s Defence13.The Tenant filed an undated Replying Affidavit and a Supplementary Affidavit dated 19th March 2024 both sworn by Patrick Muiruri Kamau.14.He avers that court proceedings are adequate enough to demonstrate who attended court on a particular day and what transpired on the said day.15.Furthermore, he contends that the only means for the Tribunal to ascertain attendance is by reviewing the court proceedings, as he has adequately highlighted.16.The Tenant maintains that the Ruling can only be overturned if the Applicant has fulfilled the necessary requirements, which, in this instance, the Applicant has failed to do. He characterizes the Applicant's Application as an afterthought, as no reasons have been provided to justify why the requested prayers should be granted.E. Issues For Determination17.I have given full consideration to the parties’ pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal, and in my respectful view, I find that the sole issue that falls for determination is:Whether this Tribunal should set aside and/or quash its Ruling and orders delivered on 17th January 2023.F. Analysis And Determination18.Section 80 of theCivil Procedure ActCap 21 provides as follows: -“Any person who considers himself aggrieved—a.by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; orb.by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.”19.Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows: -“1.(1)Any person considering himself aggrieved—a.by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; orb.by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”20.In Republic v Public Procurement Administrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] e KLR it was held: -“Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”21.Flowing from the above, the issue for determination is whether the applicant has satisfied any of the conditions set out in Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules.22.The Applicant has not presented any evidence indicating the grounds as outlined in the aforementioned jurisprudence, which is necessary for seeking a review.23.It should also be noted that the application herein was made one year after the Ruling was rendered. It is trite law, as per Order 45 Rule (1) (b), that an application for review should be made without unreasonable delay.24.With regard to delay in seeking review, the Court, in Stephen Gathua Kimani vs. Nancy Wanjira Waruingi t/a Providence Auctioneers [2016] eKLR, stated:“One thing is clear in this application. The delay of one year has not been explained. Perhaps, it’s important to recall the last sentence of Order 45 Rule 1 (1) (b) which reads “… may apply for review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”The logical question that follows is, was the present application made without unreasonable delay? Or is a delay of one year reasonable. The issue for determination is whether or not the applicant has unreasonably delayed in filing the present application. Under normal circumstances it should not take an applicant one year to file an application in court. It would require sufficient explanation to justify a delay of one year. To my mind this is a long period, and indeed an unreasonable delay.”25.In the present case, the applicant, has not addressed the delay in filing the application for review, let alone the reasons for it. The delay is, therefore, not explained. It is my view that a delay of one year is gross and unreasonable, and, therefore, the orders sought in the instant application cannot be available for granting. Only issue raised is the ruling was delivered in his absence thus denying him right to be heard a ruling is at the tail end after hearing of parties and not attending to the same would not culminate into a breach of a right to be heard as parties were already heard.26.In the upshot, the applicant has utterly failed to provide sufficient grounds to justify grant of the orders sought in the application, dated 23rdJanuary 2024.G. Determination27.In the upshot, the following orders shall abide:a.The Review Application dated 23rd January 2024 is dismissed based on unreasonable delay. Review must be within reasonable time.b.Each party to bear their own costs.HON A.

Dispute Background1.The tenant/applicant moved this Tribunal vide a Reference under Section 12(4) of theLandlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) ActCap 301 dated 6thMay 2024 with a complaint that the respondent had issued her with a defective notice dated 5thApril 2024 to vacate the suit premises, that the respondent had forcefully tried to evict the tenant on 19thMarch 2024 without any reason and went ahead to cut the metal door to the suit premises and as a result the tenant found 3 shaving machines and blow-dryer missing.2.The tenant/applicant filed a notice of motion under a certificate of urgency dated 6thMay 2024 in which she sought for the following orders; -i.That the application be certified urgent.ii.That an order be issued restraining the respondent from evicting or interfering with the tenant’s tenancy pending the hearing and determination of the complaint.iii.That the termination notice dated 5thApril 2024 be declared defective, unlawful and void.iv.That she be paid a sum of KES.52,000 used to fix the door and paying the guard for 8 days at the rate of KES.2,000 per day.v.That she be paid compensation for the 3 shaving machines and blow drier found missing due to actions of the landlord.vi.That she be paid compensation for the loss of business for the time the business was out of operation due to landlord’s unlawful action.vii.That the O.C.S Ukunda Police Station to ensure compliance.viii.That the costs of the application be borne by the respondent.3.The application is supported by an affidavit of even date in which the applicant deposes as follows; -i.That the landlord issued a defective notice to terminate tenancy dated 5thApril 2024.ii.That prior to the notice herein, the landlord/respondent without any reason on 19thMarch 2024 attempted to evict the tenant by going to the suit premises, removed/cut off the security door and left the door unsecured in the absence of the tenant and upon arrival, the tenant found some tools of trade missing, including 3 shaving machines and blow drier.iii.That the action above caused the tenant to hire a guard to protect the suit premises, paying KES. 2,000 per day totaling to KES.16,000.iv.That the applicant reported the matter to Ukunda Police station who commenced investigation and forwarded the file to the DPP for possible criminal prosecution.v.That when the respondent/landlord was told by the O.C.S Ukunda Police station to fix the door, the landlord said he had sold it, forcing the tenant to replace it at her own cost of KES. 36,000 in order to secure her tools of trade.4.This court granted interim orders of injunction dated 8thMay 2024 pending hearing of the application inter-partes.5.The application is opposed vide a replying affidavit dated 29thMay 2024 wherein the landlord/respondent deposes as follows; -i.That the application is totally incompetent and an abuse of the court process.ii.That the applicant had defaulted in rent payment with respect to the suit premises for 7 months in 2023.iii.That on several occasions, the landlord’s agents one Coast View Agencies, confronted the tenant on her default in settling rent arrears, however the tenant always gave false promises.iv.That the receipts annexed by the tenant to her supporting affidavit are a fabrication. That the said agents could not issue receipts for January to March when the tenant had arrears for previous months.v.That in an attempt to evade payment of rent arrears, the applicant presented false accusations before the police in Diani Police station and accused the landlord of breaking the door to the suit premises and stealing items.vi.That the police in their wisdom found no merits in the applicant’s accusations against the respondent hence no charges were preferred.vii.That based on the tenant’s offensive conduct, which affected the landlord-tenant relationship, the landlord proceeded to issue the eviction notice.viii.That the applicant ought to have responded to the notice prior to filing the reference herein.ix.That the applicant has not provided any evidence regarding the allegations that she incurred costs of replacing the alleged broken door and hiring of a guard.6.At a court hearing on 6thJune 2024, the tribunal ordered that the application be disposed of by way of written submissions and the applicant/tenant was granted leave to file a further affidavit.7.The tenant/applicant filed a supplementary affidavit dated 19thJune 2024 wherein she deposes as follows; -i.That the landlord is a person who always practice impunity without regard to the law and that this is not the first time for the tenant to be in court due to the landlord’s harassment and unlawful action.ii.That sometime in June 2023, the landlord unlawfully in a move to illegally enforce a verbal notice, disconnected the tenant’s electricity supply and the tenant was forced to file an application dated 17thJune 2023 subject of BPRT No. E142 of 2023 for remedy. A copy of the order is annexed and marked “A”.iii.That the allegations that the tenant has not paid rent and the receipts are fabricated are untrue.iv.That after finalization of BPRT No. 142 of 2023 in which the tenant was awarded costs of KES. 15,000, the parties sat down in the presence of a villager Chairman known as “Mzee wa Mtaa” and calculated all the rent arrears which the landlord had refused to accept in an attempt to enforce the said verbal notice and the total thereof in the sum of KES. 35,000 was paid on 13thDecember 2023 where the landlord acknowledged receipt of the same by signing an acknowledgment note and directed that the rent paid be remitted to the agent, one Coast View Agencies.v.That the landlord welded and removed the door to the suit premises. Copies of the acknowledgement signed by the landlord and the village elder, receipts of purchase of the new door and of the shaving machines and blow-drier, and picture of removed door are annexed as “B”.vi.That the respondent cannot speak on behalf of the investigating officer and nothing has been presented to this court to show that the investigations are complete.8.Both parties complied by filing their written submissions. The tenant filed hers dated 19thJune 2024 and the landlord filed his dated 26thJune 2024. We shall consider both submissions while dealing with the issues for determination.B. Issues for determination9.The following are the issues for determination; -a.Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5thApril 2024 is valid and lawful.b.Whether the tenant/applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 6thMay 2024.c.Who shall bear the costs of the application?Issue (a) Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5thApril 2024 is valid and lawful.10.The landlords herein issued a notice to vacate dated 5thApril 2024 which is annexed to the applicant’s supporting affidavit.11.In the case of Manaver N Alibhai t/a Diani Boutique – vs- South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was held as follows: -“The Act lays down clearly in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated and no term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of any such tenancy shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”12.In the instant case, we have perused the impugned notice to terminate tenancy and we note that the same is not in the prescribed form according to Cap 301 laws of Kenya.13.We therefore find that the respondent’s/landlord’s insistence on the tenant vacating the suit premises contravenes Section 4(2) of Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya and it is in this regard that we find that the Notice to Vacate the suit premises dated 5thApril 2024 is null and void ab initio.Issue (b) Whether the tenant/applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 6th May 2024.14.The tenant/applicant approached this tribunal seeking for orders to restrain the landlord from evicting or interfering with her tenancy in any manner as well as compensation for costs incurred due to the landlord’s illegal actions.15.We have already established that the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5thApril 2024 is unlawful and illegal, therefore the tenant’s plea for restraining orders against eviction or interference shall be granted as prayed.16.The landlord avers in his written submissions that the tenant was in rent arrears which caused him to issue the impugned notice to terminate tenancy. The tenant on the other hand tendered evidence of rent payment to the landlord’s agent for the months of January to March 2024 which the landlord disputes and claims that the said receipts are forged.17.Upon perusal of filed documents in this matter, we find that the landlord has not filed any rent account statements to demonstrate the tenant’s rent arrears. There being no proof on the landlord’s side, the tribunal shall order that the tenant continues to pay rent as and when the same falls due.18.On the issue of compensation, the tenant in her written submissions refers the court to pictures showing her shop without a door which are annexed to her supplementary affidavit.19.The tenant states that as a result of the landlord’s action above mentioned, the tenant lost her items to wit, 3 shaving machines and blow drier worth KES. 32,800 as per the attached receipts, and also spent KES. 36,000 for buying and fixing a new door to secure her items.20.The landlord on the other hand in his written submissions states that the tenant has not presented any evidence regarding the allegations that the respondent broke the door to the suit premises and the losses allegedly incurred as a result thereof.21.In addition, the landlord states that the receipts annexed to the applicant’s supplementary affidavit only shows purchase of the items and do not constitute evidence of theft of the items in question. Furthermore, the landlord avers that the receipt with respect to the purchase and fixing of the door is not a confirmation that the door in question was for the suit premises and that the tenant has annexed unclear photos showing the alleged broken door.22.We have perused the photographs annexed to the tenant’s supplementary affidavit and we agree with the landlord that they are not clear. Consequently, there is not enough proof on the issue of the broken door therefore this tribunal is unable to issue orders with regard to compensation of the alleged broken door.23.On the issue of the missing items, we have perused the said receipts of the items, however there is not enough proof to demonstrate that the said items were stolen from the suit premises. The said receipts are purchase receipts of the items which does not amount to sufficient evidence that the items were lost as a result of the alleged breaking of the door to the suit premises.24.The tenant has also not shown any evidence of paying a guard for 8 days at the rate of KES. 2,000 per day for the period after the landlord had allegedly broken the door to the suit premises.25.It is trite law that “he who alleges must prove”. Based on the above analysis, the tribunal is unable to grant the orders of compensation that the tenant has sought in the application.Issue (c) Who shall bear the costs of the application?26.Under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya, costs of any suit before this Tribunal are in its discretion but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall order costs of the application to the tenant/applicant.C.

(howard@hlaw.co.ke)B. Dispute Background5.On 27thOctober 2023, this Honourable Court delivered a ruling allowing the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 30thmay 2023 in the following terms:a.The landlady’s preliminary objection dated 14thJune 2023 is hereby dismissed.b.The Landlady’s notice of alteration of terms dated 6thSeptember 2022 and the notice of termination dated 23rdFebruary 2023 are invalid.c.The tenant to remain in the premises and continue to pay rent as and when it falls due and to enter into a formal lease with the Landlady.d.Landlady at liberty to issue fresh and proper notice to the tenant.e.Each party to bear its own costs.6.Subsequently, the landlady issued a notice of termination dated 5thApril 2024 on the grounds that the Tenant has continued to make irregular payments and has failed to formalize the tenancy despite being given ample time to review and consider the terms of the lease.7.On 18thJuly 2024, the Landlady moved this Court vide a Notice of motion Application under a Certificate of Urgency seeking eviction orders against the Tenant to which the Tenant opposed in a Repying Affidavit dated 20thAugust 2024.8.It is the Landlady’s Application dated 18thJuly 2024 that is the subject of this ruling.C. Claim And Defence9.It is the Landlady’s claims that the Tenant has failed to comply with the Court’s directives issued vide the Ruling delivered on 27thOctober 2023. The landlady avers that the Tenant has continued to make irregular rent payments and formalize the lease despite been given ample time to review and consider the terms of the lease and being reminded severally.10.The Landlady avers that based on the above grounds, she issued the Tenant with a notice to terminate dated 5thApril 2024 with an effective date of 1stJuly 2024, which notice period has lapsed yet the Tenant has declined to vacate the suit premises.11.In his Replying Affidavit dated 20thAugust 2024, the Tenant avers that he has been paying rent and has already cleared the arrears owing but the Landlady has not been issuing him with receipts which he did not produce as proof of payment.12.Further, the Tenant avers that he is willing to make good the payments record going forward.D. Issues For Determination13.I have carefully analyzed all the Pleadings filed and the relevant evidence adduced before honorable Court. I considerately find that the issues that fall for determination are:Whether this Court should grant the Orders sought.E. Analysis Of The LawWhether this Court should grant the Orders sought.14.I have carefully perused the Ruling delivered by this Honourable Court dismissing the Landlady’s Preliminary Objection and allowing the Tenant’s Application on the grounds that the notice of termination issued was invalid and hence, ineffective.15.Consequently, this Court directed that the Tenant continues to pay rent as and when it falls due and to formalize the tenancy between him and the Landlady.16.I note that the Landlady has produced before this Court bank statements that clearly indicate the Tenant’s irregular rent payment while the Tenant has not produced any material to prove that his rent payment is up to date.17.Further, the Landlady has attached a letter dated 13thMarch 2024 where she indicated that the Tenant was yet to share his comments on the draft lease and imploring the Tenant to pay rent in full and on time.18.In light of the above, it is clear that the Tenant has failed to comply with this Court’s directives.19.Additionally, the Tenant did not challenge the Landlady’s notice to terminate which I find valid and to be in compliance with the requirements of terminating a controlled tenancy as per Section 4 (2) of Cap 301.20.It is noteworthy that the Landlady’s right to property, which right includes the right to get a return on his investment, is protected under Article 40 ofthe Constitutionof Kenya, 2010.21.Besides, it is an implied term of every Tenancy that the Tenant pays full rent as agreed and to pay the same on time.F. Determination22.The upshot is that the Landlady’s Notice of Motion Application dated 18thJuly 2024 is allowed in the following terms:a.The Tenant shall pay any outstanding rent arrears within 14 days and give back vacant possession to the Landlady within 30 days. Failure to which the land lady shall be at liberty to break in with the assistance of OCS Kamkunji Police Station.b.Each party to bear its own costs.HON A.

Affidavits7.As indicated above the respondent is seeking for stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of an intended appeal. There is a notice of appeal annexed to the application dated 26thSeptember, 2023, and filed on 28thSeptember 2023, four (4) days after the judgment was delivered.8.In the supporting affidavit it is deposed that the decretal sum is substantial and that the claimant’s assets are not within the knowledge of the respondent and the respondent shall suffer substantial loss unless stay of execution is granted.9.It is deposed that the respondent has discharged the legal burden by demonstrating that on reasonable grounds the claimant is incapable of repaying the decretal sum if the appeal ultimately succeeds. Further, it is deposed that the respondent moved to court within reasonable time and it is willing to provide security for the due performance of the decree as by it may be directed by this Honourable court.10.In the replying affidavit, the claimant deposed that the application is an abuse of the court process, a delaying tactic, and that the same does not meet the legal threshold for stay of execution to issue. it is deposed that if allowed the stay shall cause substantial loss to the claimant.11.Further, it is deposed that the respondent has not provided security for due performance of the decree hence making the application unmerited and prejudicial to the claimant if granted.12.It is deposed that the claimant is a financially stable business owner with uniform shops across Kenya.

It is deposed that if a stay of execution is granted, the court should direct the respondent to deposit the entire decretal sum in an interest-earning account in the joint names of advocates for the parties.III. Submissions By Counsel14.Counsel for the respondent submitted on the principles for granting stay of execution pending appeal as provided for under Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides that -(2)No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—(a)the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and(b)such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.15.Counsel cited the case of Kiambu Transport vs Kenya Breweries on conditions applicable for stay of execution.16.On the issue of unreasonable delay, counsel argues that the notice of appeal was filed within the seven days period provided for under Rule 77 of the Court of Appeal rules after the impugned judgment was delivered on 21stSeptember, 2023.17.On the issue of substantial loss, counsel argues that the logbook furnished by the claimant was not accompanied with a valuation report and no proof of ownership of the alleged business was availed. Counsel further argues that if the appeal ultimately succeeds the respondent will not be in a position to recover the decretal sum from the claimant hence substantial loss. Counsel cited Mukuma V Abuoga (1988) KLR 645, Tropical Commodities Suppliers Ltd & Others V International Credit Bank Ltd Misc Application No. 379/2003which cited Antoine Ndiaye V African Virtual University [2015] eKLR and Daniel Chebutul Rotich & 2 Others V Emirates Airlines Civil Case No. 368 of 2001 on what amounts to substantial loss.18.On the issue of proof of ability of a decree-holder to repay the decretal sum, counsel cited ABN Amro Bank V Le Monde Foods Ltd Application No. 15 of 2002,National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd V Aquinas Francis Wasike & Anor Civil Application No. 238 of 2005(UR 144/2005); and Alhyder Trading Company Ltd V Lucy Jepngetich Mibei (2016) eKLR. Counsel submitted that the claimant admitted that she is unemployed and that she has failed to demonstrate her ability to repay the decretal sum in case the appeal ultimately succeeds.19.On the issue of security, counsel argues that the respondent is willing to tender security in accordance with Order 42 rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules and that it is willing to have the decretal sum deposited in an interest earning account in the joint names of the advocates for the parties within 60 days. Counsel cited Vista Holdings International Limited V Span Image (K) Limited [2014] eKLR and Nduhiu Gitahi Warugongo [1988] KLR; 1 KAR 100 [1988-92] 2 KAR 100 on provision of security in an application for stay.IV. Determination20.The primary and overriding objective and duty of this court is to do justice in accordance with Article 159 ofthe Constitution, Sections 1A, & 1B of theCivil Procedure Act, and Section 3 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act, amongst many other provisions of the law.21.Order 42 Rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules grants this court discretionary powers in allowing stay of execution considering factors such as - Whether the appeal raises triable issues; Whether the appeal shall be rendered nugatory if stay is denied; Whether the decree-holder has the ability to repay the money in the case the appeal ultimately succeeds. See - Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal (1979) KLR.22.The application was filed on 2ndNovember, 2023 and a notice of appeal was filed on 28thSeptember, 2023, four days after the judgment was delivered. Further, the respondent has offered to provide security in due performance of the decree pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.23.In Absalom Dova V Tarbo Transporters (2013) eKLR the Court of Appeal interpreted Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules on stay of execution pending an appeal to a superior court as follows -“The discretionary relief of stay of execution pending appeal is designed on the basis that no one would be worse off by virtue of an order of the court, as such order does not introduce any disadvantage, but administers the justice that the case deserves. This is in recognition that both parties have rights. The Appellant to his appeal which includes the prospects that the appeal will not be rendered nugatory, and the decree holder to the decree which includes full benefits under the decree. The court in balancing the two compelling rights focuses on their reconciliation.”24.In the interest of justice, therefore, the court shall allow the application on the terms set hereunder.V. Costs25.The costs of the application shall abide with the costs in the appeal.VI. Orders26.The notice of motion dated 2ndNovember, 2023 by the respondent is allowed on the following terms -a.Stay of execution be and is hereby granted pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal.b.The respondent shall within 30 days of this ruling –i.Pay a sum of Kshs1,500,000/= to the claimant.ii.Deposit the balance of Kshs1,375,000/= in a joint interest-earning account to be opened in the joint names of the law firms for both parties in a different but reputable financial banking institution other than the respondent.c.In default of (b) above, the stay of execution shall automatically lapse.d.Costs of the application shall be in the appeal.DELIVERED VIRTUALLY, DATED, AND SIGNED AT NAKURU THIS 4THDAY OF JULY, 2024..............................DAVID NDERITUJUDGE",Mwangi v Family Bank Limited (Employment and Labour Relations Cause 331 of 2014) [2024] KEELRC 2177 (KLR) (4 July 2024) (Ruling),Employment and Labour Relations Cause 331 of 2014,"DN Nderitu, J","July 4, 2024",

Introduction1.In this ruling, for ease of reference, the applicant shall be referred to as “the advocate” while the respondent shall be referred to as “the client”.2.The advocate, a law-firm, commenced the proceedings herein by way of an advocate/client bill of costs dated 17thMay, 2022, claiming for a total sum of Kshs1,207,009/= in legal fees for services rendered to the client.3.In a ruling delivered on 3rdOctober, 2023, the deputy registrar (taxing officer) taxed the bill at Kshs482,012.50 and subsequently a certificate of costs was issued on 25thOctober, 2023.4.Subsequently, the advocate proceeded to apply for and obtained warrants for execution in satisfaction of the debt due and owing, and properties belonging to the client were proclaimed for attachment and sale through public auction.5.On 24thNovember, 2023 the client filed a chamber summons (the application) under a certificate of urgency seeking for the following orders –1.That this application e certified urgent and heard ex-parte in the first instance;2.That the Applicant be granted leave to file an objection and a Taxation Reference to this Honourable Court against the Ruling of the Honourable Court’s Taxing Officer delivered on 3rdOctober, 2023.3.That pending inter-parties hearing and determination of this Application this Honourable Court be pleased to grant and hereby grants a stay of execution of the Ruling delivered on 3rdOctober, 2023 as to the taxation of the Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 17thMay, 2022.4.That pending inter parties hearing and determination of this Application this Honourable Court be pleased to grant and hereby grants a Stay of Execution of the Warrants of Attachment of Movable property issued on 22ndNovember, 2023.5.That the court do grant any other order that this Honourable Court deems fit and just to grant in the circumstances.6.That costs of the application be provided for.6.The court issued a temporary order for stay of execution on 27thNovember, 2023 and the said orders were on 13thDecember, 2023 extended by consent pending the hearing and determination of the application.7.The application is expressed to be brought under the provisions of Article 159 ofthe Constitution, Rule 11(1)(2) & (4) of the Advocates (Remuneration)(Amendment) Order 2014, & Sections 1A, 1B, & 3A of theCivil Procedure Act. It is based on the grounds on the face of it and supported with the affidavit of the client sworn on 23rdNovember, 2023, with several annexures thereto.8.In response to the application the advocate filed a replying affidavit sworn by Albert S. Kuloba, on 11thDecember, 2023 with several annexures thereto.9.With the leave of the court the client filed a supplementary affidavit sworn by herself on 15thJanuary, 2024 with several annexures thereto.10.On 13thDecember, 2023 the court directed that the application be canvassed by way of written submissions. Counsel for the client, Miss Amuka filed her submissions on 12thFebruary, 2024 while Mr. Kuloba for the advocate filed on 26thFebruary, 2024.II. Evidence/affidavits11.Essentially, the application by the client is seeking for leave to file a reference (essentially an appeal or review) of the taxation done by the taxing officer, alluded to in the introductory part of this ruling, out of time. The other prayer is for stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the application, which was allowed by consent as stated in an earlier part of this ruling. There is no express prayer for stay of execution pending the filing, hearing, and determination of the intended reference.12.In the supporting affidavit, it is deposed that after the advocate/client bill of costs was taxed at Kshs482,012.50 the advocate applied for execution and warrants of attachment were issued and the client’s moveable properties were proclaimed for attachment and sale through public auction in satisfaction and settlement of the amount due and payable.13.The impugned ruling on taxation was delivered on 3rdOctober, 2023 while the warrants of attachment were issued on 22ndNovember, 2023.14.It is deposed that the delay in filing of the reference was occasioned by illness on the part of counsel for the client who allegedly was on sick-leave from 4thOctober, 2023 to 17thNovember, 2023.15.It is deposed that the application was filed without unreasonable or inordinate delay and that the delay is explained on the basis of illness on the part of counsel for the client.16.It is deposed that the client now wishes to file a reference against the taxation. It is alleged that the taxing officer failed to account for a sum of Kshs200,000/= that had allegedly been paid by the client to the advocate prior to the taxation.17.It is deposed that the taxing officer failed to give reasons for the taxation as she did and as such it is alleged that the taxation highly prejudiced the client.18.In response, it is deposed in the replying affidavit that the client only filed the application to forestall the execution process and to further delay the settlement of the matter. It is deposed that the advocate expected a higher award than what was granted in the taxation, but for the sake of bringing the matter to a close the advocate decided not to apply for a reference and hence only proceeded to apply for execution once the client took no steps towards payment and settlement of the taxed amount. It is deposed that the application is intended to frustrate the advocate from recovering lawful fees for services rendered.19.It is deposed that the client filed the application only upon being served with the notice of proclamation and attachment in execution.20.It is deposed that on 3rdOctober, 2023, the date of the ruling on taxation, counsel for the client, Mr. Chumo, was present in court and no application for stay of execution, leave to file a reference, or any other application was made in court.21.It is further deposed that no efforts were made by the client to pay the amount awarded in taxation or file a reference and therefore, ultimately, the advocate took out the execution proceedings.22.It is deposed that no evidence has been availed in court to demonstrate that the client’s counsel was sick on or between 3rdOctober, 2023 and 17thNovember, 2023. It is deposed that counsel for the advocate was in constant contact with the counsel for the client and at no point was it mentioned or alleged that counsel for the client was unwell.23.It is deposed that the alleged sum of Kshs200,000/= paid to the advocate by the client was fees in a completely different matter, an anticorruption case, where the advocate defended the client and the same had nothing to do with the taxation herein which was in regard to an employment and labour relations cause between the client and her former employer, Maasai Mara University, being Nakuru ELRC No. E009 of 2020.24.It is deposed that the taxing officer gave her reasons for the taxation in the ruling and in any event no request has been made by the client to have such reasons clarified or restated altogether.25.In the supplementary affidavit it is deposed that the counsel in conduct of the matter, Mr. Chum Kibet, fell ill on 9thOctober, 2023 and remained on sick-leave till 24thOctober, 2023 and it is alleged that this explains why he was unable to file the reference within the time allowed. It is deposed that when the client contacted the said counsel sometimes in November, 2023 the time for filing a reference was long gone hence the instant application.III. Submissions By Counsel26.Counsel for the client submits that the client intends to challenge the entire taxing as the same is deemed excessive with no reasons given by the taxing officer.27.In regard to whether the leave to file the intended reference out of time should be granted, counsel cited Paragraph 11 of the Advocates Remuneration Order, 2014 (ARO) which provides as follows –11.(1)Should any party object to the decision of the taxing officer, he may within fourteen days after the decision give notice in writing to the taxing officer of the items of taxation to which he objects.(2)The taxing officer shall forthwith record and forward to the objector the reasons for his decision on those items and the objector may within fourteen days form the receipt of the reasons apply to a judge by chamber summons, which shall be served on all the parties concerned, setting out the grounds of his objection.(3)Any person aggrieved by the decision of the judge upon any objection referred to such judge under subparagraph (2) may, with the leave of the judge but not otherwise, appeal to the Court of Appeal.(4)The High Court shall have power in its discretion by order to enlarge the time fixed by subparagraph(1) or subparagraph(2) for the taking of any step; application for such an order may be made by chamber summons upon giving to every other interested party not less than three clear days’ notice in writing or as the Court may direct, and may be so made notwithstanding that the time sought to be enlarged may have already expired.28.It is submitted that going by the above provisions this court has discretionary powers to enlarge time. It is further submitted that the same position is supported by Order 50 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 that provides as follows –6.Whereas a limited time has been fixed for doing any act or taking any proceedings under the Rules, or by summary notice or by order of the court, the court shall have power to enlarge such time upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require, and such enlargement may be ordered although the application for the same is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed.Provided that the costs of any application to extend such time and of any order made thereon shall be borne by the parties making such application, unless the court orders otherwise.29.Counsel cited several decisions on the factors that the court should consider in determining how to exercise its discretion in an application such as this one. It is submitted that the court should consider the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the chances of the reference succeeding, and the degree of prejudice to either party if the application is granted.30.In regard to the length of delay counsel cited Sokoro Savings & Credit Co-operative Society Ltd V Mwamburi (2023) eKLR; Charles N. Ngugi V ASL Credit Limited (2022) eKLR; and George Kagima Kariuki & 2 Others V George M. Gichimu (2014) eKLR.31.On the reasons for the delay it is submitted that the illness on the part of the counsel for the client caused the delay and failure of the reference being filed in the time stipulated. It is submitted that in the circumstances the delay is excusable. Counsel cited Mativo J (now JA) in Njoroge V Kimani (2022) eKLR on what constitutes inexcusable or inordinate delay. In the same breath, counsel cited other decisions among them County Government of Tana River V Miller & Co Advocates (2021) eKLR; Florence Nyaguthii Muchemi V Attorney General & Another (2018) eKLR; and CMC Holdings Limited V Nzioki (2004) 1KLR 173 amongst other decisions on the same point.32.It is submitted that prima facie the intended reference has merits.33.On the issue of prejudice to the client if the application is allowed, it is submitted that with the high chances of success in the intended reference, the client shall be prejudiced if the application is denied and the execution allowed to proceed.34.Although the application does not expressly pray for stay of execution pending the filing, hearing, and determination of the reference, counsel for the client has submitted on stay of execution without specifying what the requested stay shall pend.35.Counsel for the advocate submitted that the medical records attached to the supplementary affidavit are categorical that contrary to the allegations made by the client, counsel for the client was unwell between 9thand 24thdays of November, 2023. It is therefore submitted that for the period after the ruling on 3rdOctober, 2023 to 9thNovember, 2023 the concerned counsel was well and in good health. It is submitted that this fact demonstrates that the application by the client is made in bad faith, intended to frustrate the advocate in recovery of lawful legal fees for services rendered, aimed at delaying the conclusion of the matter, filed with the intention of misleading the court, and without merits.36.Counsel for the advocate cited Joseph Lekodi Teleu V Jonathan Paapai & Another (2022) eKLR in support of the argument that the application has no merits and urged the court to be persuaded by the said decision which dealt with similar issues as those in the instant application.37.It is submitted that after the ruling on the taxation the client did not issue a notice to the taxing officer on what items she was opposed or objecting to as required under Paragraph 11 of the ARO as reproduced elsewhere in this ruling. It is argued that the client has not even demonstrated in the application which items she intends to object to or challenge.38.It is vehemently argued that the application is a ploy to frustrate the advocate in the process of recovery of legal fees for services rendered and delay the settlement as long as it takes. It is argued that even if one assumed that the counsel for the client fell ill as alleged, which is however vehemently denied, the client has not demonstrated what efforts she made in following up the matter that in reality belongs to her not to her counsel. The court is urged to dismiss the application.IV. Determination39.Upon careful and thorough reading of the application, the affidavits filed in support and in opposition thereto, the proceedings and the ruling by the taxing officer, and the written submissions by counsel for both parties, the following issues commend themselves for determination by the court -a.Should the client be granted leave to file a reference out of time?b.If (a) above is in the affirmative, should the applicant be granted stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the intended reference?c.What are the appropriate orders on costs?40.The subject matter of this application is not as complex as the parties, and more so the client, wishes the court to believe. The applicable law is Paragraph 11 of the ARO cited verbatim in a proceeding part of this ruling. The procedure applicable is that once a taxing officer makes a ruling a party wishing to object to any of the items may issue a notice to the taxing officer within 14 days of the decision to that effect. Upon receipt of the notice the taxing officer may respond thereto giving or stating the reasons for the taxation of the objected items within 14 days of the notice. Upon receipt of the reasons from the taxing officer the objecting party may within 14 days file a reference before a judge by way of a chamber summons for the determination on the objected items.41.Paragraph 11(4) of the ARO donates to a judge the discretionary power to enlarge the foregoing timelines upon an application filed by way of chamber summons.42.The client missed on the deadlines set by the law cited above as a result of which she has filed the instant application for enlargement of the time to start the process of filing the intended reference. The reason advanced for the client not acting within the time allowed is that her counsel fell sick and failed to take the appropriate steps. That is the one and only reason given as to why the intended reference was not filed within the time allowed.43.The court finds and holds that the above reason advanced by the client lacks merits and it is only intended to mislead the court. Firstly, counsel for the client was present in court when the ruling on the taxation was delivered on 3rdOctober, 2023. The medical records availed by the client for the alleged illness on the part of the said counsel, Mr. Chumo Kibet, indicate and confirm that he was attended to in the hospital between 9thto 24thNovember, 2023, over a month after the ruling. Secondly, there is no evidence or explanation whatsoever as to what steps the client took to instruct his counsel to commence the process of filing the reference. Thirdly, the said counsel has not filed any affidavit in support or in explanation of the delay in filing the reference and even the application to file the reference out of time. Fourthly, it is not explained or established that the said counsel was the only one in the law-firm who could handle the matter.44.The court finds and holds that the client only considered filing the application after the advocate took out the execution proceedings. The delay has not been explained and hence there is no reason for the same, the same is an afterthought intended to defeat justice and deny the advocate the fees as taxed for legal services rendered.45.Since there is no explanation given for the delay, the delay is held to be unreasonable and inordinate. The law sets deadlines for the purposes of fair and just adjudication of disputes. If parties were allowed to take actions at their pace, pleasure, and convenience, justice shall be delayed and denied.46.In the circumstances, the court finds no reason to grant the leave sought and consequently there are no grounds for granting stay of execution.47.Consequently, therefore, the application by the client is hereby dismissed with costs to the advocate. The costs of the application are hereby assessed at Kshs20,000/=. The client shall also meet the costs of the execution that was stayed.V. Orders48.For all the foregoing reasons, the chamber summons application by the client dated 23rdNovember, 2023 is hereby dismissed in its entirety with costs to the Advocate, which costs are hereby assessed at Kshs20,000/=. The client shall also meet the costs of the execution that was stayed.DELIVERED VIRTUALLY, DATED, AND SIGNED AT NAKURU THIS 4THDAY OF JULY, 2024............................DAVID NDERITUJUDGE",A S Kuloba & Wangila Advocates v Walingo (Miscellaneous Application E011 of 2022) [2024] KEELRC 2176 (KLR) (4 July 2024) (Ruling),Miscellaneous Application E011 of 2022,"DN Nderitu, J","July 4, 2024",

Parties And Representatives1.The Applicant, Colin Stuart T/A Little Bay Investment Ltd., is the owner of Shop No. 113 located at Digo Bazaar situated in Diani, being the suit premises herein (hereinafter the “Landlord”).2.The firm of Dagaye & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.3.The Respondent, Michael Yego, is the tenant and had rented space for business in the suit property (hereinafter the “Tenant”).4.The firm of Wonanio & Kabiaro Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.B. Background Of The Dispute5.The Landlord moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and a Notice of Motion Application filed under a Certificate of Urgency both dated 14thMarch, 2024 on a complaint that the Tenant has refused to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord despite being issued with a Termination Notice as per the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotel and Catering Establishments) Act.6.In response thereto, the Tenant filed a Replying Affidavit dated 10thMay 2024 and the Landlord correspondingly filed a Further Affidavit dated 5thJune 2024.7.The Tribunal directed that the Application dated 14thMarch 2024 will be canvassed by way of written submissions and accordingly, the Landlord filed its Written Submissions dated 3rdJuly 2024 while the Tenant filed his Written Submissions dated 10thJuly 2024.C. The Landlord’s Claim9.The Landlord submits that the nature of their tenancy is a controlled tenancy governed by a written agreement that commenced on or about February 2022 and was for a period of 5 years.10.The Landlord also submits that the tenancy between itself and the Tenant had been terminated vide a Notice to Terminate dated 8thDecember 2023 (hereinafter “the Notice”) which was meant to take effect on 1stMarch 2024 being two months after issuance of the Notice.11.It is the Landlord’s averment that the Notice was issued in accordance with the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotel and Catering Establishments) Act which provides for termination of a controlled tenancy.12.Ultimately, the Landlord urged the Tribunal to allow the Landlord’s Reference and Notice of Motion Application with costs to the Tenant.D. The Tenant’s Claim13.The Tenant agrees that the Agreement between himself and the Landlord began in February 2022 for the period of five (5) years subject to renewal upon the expiration of the Agreement in 2026 thus the tenancy is a controlled tenancy.14.In light of the same, the Tenant avers that he had the firm believe that the tenancy was going to be a long-term business relationship and consequently invested heavily in the suit premises by erecting semi-permanent structures and conducting renovations on the let space with the full knowledge and consent of the Landlord.15.The Tenant also states that the suit premises, which is situated on the ground floor of the building, was subject to leakage arising from the unfinished state of the first floor which was still under construction and heavy rainfall caused water to leak through the pipes containing electric cables leading to destruction of the Tenant’s electronics. The Tenant avers that he incurred a cost of Kshs. 56,000.00 for repair and replacement of the electronics and Kshs. 28,000.00 for repair of the leaking roof.16.It is the Tenant’s averment that the Landlord instituted termination as a scape goat for compensating the Tenant for the aforementioned repairs.E. List Of Issues For Determination17.Having given full consideration to the submissions filed by Counsels, the issue for determination is;a.Whether the Notice to Terminate dated 8thDecember 2023 is valid and as such, whether the Tenant should hand over vacant possession to the Landlord?F. Analysis & Determination18.The Submissions filed by the parties raises fundamental issues discussed herein below:a)Whether the Notice to Terminate dated 8thDecember 2023 is valid and as such, whether the Tenant should hand over vacant possession to the Landlord?19.TheLandlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) ActChapter 301 Laws of Kenya Act at section 4(2) provides that:“A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or to alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under, such a tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form.”20.Section 4(4) of Cap 301 further provides that:“No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party, as shall be specified therein.”21.In the case of Manaver N. Alibhai T/A Diani Boutique vs. South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited, Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was stated as follows;“The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in Form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”22.Section 4(5) of the Act states:“A tenancy notice shall not be effective for any of the purposes of this Act unless it specifies the grounds upon which the requesting party seeks the termination, alteration or reassessment concerned and requires the receiving party to notify the requesting party in writing, within one month after the date of receipt of the notice, whether or not he agrees to comply with the notice.”23.In this case the Landlords issued the tenant with the Notice on 8thDecember 2023 which was to take effect from 1stMarch 2024. Based on the above provision, the said notice was to take effect after more than two months which is as per the Provisions of CAP 301.24.Moreover, the Notice provided for the recipient to communicate whether or not they intend to comply with the Notice within one month after receipt thereof. This is in line with the provision encompassed in Section 4(5) of the Act which establishes the contents of an effective termination notice.25.The main question for determination that remains before this Tribunal is with regards to the substance of the said Notice.26.Section 7 of the Act provides for the grounds within which Landlord is allowed to issue a termination notice and at subsection (g) it provides as follows;“Where under section 4 of this Act served a notice of termination of a controlled tenancy on the tenant, the grounds on which the landlord seeks to terminate such tenancy may be such of the following grounds as are stated in the aforesaid notice—subject as hereinafter provided, that on the termination of the tenancy the landlord himself intends to occupy for a period of not less than one year the premises comprised in the tenancy for the purposes, or partly for the purposes, of a business to be carried on by him therein, or at his residence.”27.It is of equal importance to highlight the guidelines of opposing a termination notice as provided for in Section 6(1) of the Landlord & Tenant Act which states as follows:“A receiving party who wishes to oppose a tenancy notice, and who has notified the requesting party under section 4(5) of this Act that he does not agree to comply with the tenancy notice, may, before the date upon which such notice is to take effect, refer the matter to a Tribunal, whereupon such notice shall be of no effect until, and subject to, the determination of the reference by the Tribunal: Provided that a Tribunal may, for sufficient reason and on such conditions as it may think fit, permit such a reference notwithstanding that the receiving party has not complied with any of the requirements of this section.”28.Pursuant to the above provision, this Tribunal is of the view that the Tenant had sufficient time and means to oppose the Notice but he did not issue written communication that he did not agree to comply with the Notice within a month after receipt of the Notice. Neither did the Tenant refer the matter to a tribunal before the Notice was to take effect being 1stMarch 2024.29.Inferring from the Tenant’s behavior as outlined hereinabove, the Tribunal is of the impression that the Tenant was willing to comply with the Notice as he did not follow due procedure of opposing the said Notice.30.Therefore, it remains unclear why the Tenant refuses and/or neglects to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord whilst he had opportunity to legally oppose the termination notice before the date it was meant to take effect.31.The Court opines that the Tenant is raising issues that are not pertinent to the matter at hand and whilst we hold high regard for the weight of the issues raised herein by the Tenant, the Tenant should have sought redress for the same in the manner prescribed by the law.32.Accordingly, this Tribunal is guided by the provisions of the law encapsulated in the Landlord and Tenant Act and is inclined to uphold the validity and legality of the Termination Notice dated 8thDecember 2023 as it fully satisfies the requirements of a valid Termination Notice as per the aforesaid Act.G. Orders33.The upshot is that the Landlords Reference and Notice of Motion Application dated 14thMarch 2024 are dismissed with orders as follows:a.The Tenant is hereby ordered to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord within thirty (30) days after issuance of this Ruling;b.Upon the Tenant’s failure to comply, the Landlord is at liberty to break into the suit premises and take vacant possession of the same;c.O.C.S Ukunda Police Station to ensure compliance of these Orders; andd.Costs of the suit to be borne by the Tenant at Kshs.

      [2024] KEHC 10556 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at BusiaSuccession Cause 110 of 1997WM Musyoka, JSeptember 5, 2024IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF MUKHWABI RAGAMA AND KIRONDE MUKHWABI (DECEASED)Ruling1.The application, for determination, is a chamber summons, dated 16thApril 2024. It is at the instance of Everline Natocho Juma, and it seeks that she and Peter Juma be subjected to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, with the Government Chemist, to clear all doubts as whether Peter Juma was her biological father.2.The said application was provoked by the outcome in Busia HC Misc. Application No. E052 of 2023, where the administrator herein had obtained an order against the National Registration Bureau, to release documents relating to her national identity card registration, to confirm who was reflected, in those documents, as her parents. The administrator alleged that her parents are Peter Juma and Leonida Mugeni, something which she asserts not to be true. She asserts that her parents are Kironde Mukhwabi and Leonida Mugeni. She avers that both Kironde Mukhwabi and Leonida Mugeni are dead, but Peter Juma is alive, hence a DNA test could be conducted using samples from him. She avers that, should the order not be granted, she would suffer prejudice.3.There is a reply to the application, by Morris Oduor Were, the administrator. He avers that the said application is frivolous and an afterthought, prompted by confirmation from the State that the registration details in its possession confirm who the parents of the applicant are. He avers that the applicant has not denied that she was the author of the information in the possession of the office of the registrar of persons. He further avers that the applicant had alleged that Peter Juma was her uncle, and not her biological father. He asserts that conduct of the DNA test would be a wild goose chase, as it would not produce proof beyond doubt who her father is. He argues that if the court were to be persuaded that Peter Juma was not her biological father, then the court should cite her for perjury. He argues that 1 can only have 1 father for succession purposes, and that once she renounced the deceased as her father, in those registration documents, then she can only inherit from her officially recognised father, Peter Juma. He further argues that the application by the applicant, for revocation of grant, which is still pending, dated 28thSeptember 2023, revolves around the paternity of the applicant, and the applicant was bound to prove that Kironde Mukhwabi was her father.4.I have perused the summons for revocation of grant, dated 28thSeptember 2023, and noted that paternity of the applicant is at the heart of it. I have also perused the file in Busia HC. Misc. Application No. E052 of 2023, which subpoenaed the records from the registrar of persons, with respect to the details the applicant used to obtain her national identification card, and noted that the same was prompted by the filing of the application, dated 28thSeptember 2023, and was intended to obtain information for use at the hearing of the said summons.5.I am persuaded that the application herein, dated 16thApril 2024, is premature. It should become necessary after hearing and disposal of the application, dated 28thSeptember 2023. A DNA test is intrusive (see In re Estate of SMM’I (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Mabeya, J)), particularly where the consent of a person who is not party ot the cause is not obtained (see RNC & & 2 others vs. SMG [2017] eKLR (Ougo, J)), In re Estate of MAP (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Ougo, J) and In re Estate of ZWN (Deceased) [2022] eKLR (J. Ngugi, J), and it should be adverted to as a last resort. See SWW vs. GMK (2012) eKLR (Majanja, J), RNC & & 2 others vs. SMG [2017] eKLR (Ougo, J and In re Estate of Peter Muraya Chege alias Muraya Chege (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Ndung’u, J). It should be considered only after the application, dated 28thSeptember 2023, is resolved in a manner which establishes that the applicant herein was not a child of Kironde Mukhwabi. A trial, on the correctness or genuineness of the information from the registrar of persons, should be conducted at the hearing of the revocation application. It should be in that hearing that the applicant has to establish the manner in which she is a child of Kironde Mukhwabi, and only upon strong evidence pointing to a close relationship between the mother of the claimant and the deceased, pointing a possibility that it could have led to a conception of the applicant. See In re Estate of JSM (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Achode, J) and In re Estate of JMK (Deceased) [2021] eKLR (Achode, J). The best way forward, with respect to the application, dated 16thApril 2024, is to have it canvassed within the hearing of the revocation application, dated 28thSeptember 2023, where, depending on the evidence adduced, the court will assess whether or not to order a paternity test through DNA samples.6.There is one matter that I have noted, which is not raised in any of the applications, but which is of critical importance, and, I believe, it should be addressed at the hearing of the summons for revocation of the grant. The cause herein relates to an estate of 2 individuals, Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi. There cannot be a joint estate of 2 individuals, for succession purposes. There can only be 1 estate for each individual. There must be 1 for Mukhwabi Ragama, and another for Kironde Mukhwabi. It could be that the 2 owned the property jointly, or 1 was the father of the other, and upon the death of the father, it was presumed that the estate automatically devolved upon the son, hence the need to initiate 1 succession cause in respect thereof.7.Whatever the case, there can only be 1 succession cause in respect of the estate of 1 individual, and a single succession cause should not combine administration of estates of two or more individuals. There can only be 1 administration for each estate. See In Re Estate of James Kiarie Muiruri (Deceased) [2004] eKLR (Koome, J), In re Estate of Samuel Ngugi Mbugua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Musyoka, J) and In re Estate of Josphat Gatia Muchiri (Deceased) [2018] (Musyoka, J). In this case, therefore, 2 causes ought to have been initiated, 1 in the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, and the other in the estate of Kironde Mukhwabi. If Kironde Mukhwabi was a son of Mukhwabi Ragama, then succession to the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama should be handled first, so that what is due to the estate of Kironde Mukhwabi, from the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, is determined and devolved to that estate, to enable the descendants of Kironde Mukhwabi have access to that assets.8.I have seen a copy of the search certificate, in respect of the estate asset, Samia/Bujwanga/959, and I have noted that the property was registered in the names of 3 individuals, including Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi, with each holding a 1/3 share. That meant that the 3 held the property in tenancy in common, with each of the co-owners having a distinct 1/3 share. See In re Estate of John Ngumba Njoroge (Deceased) [2018] eKLR (J. Ngugi, J) and In re Estate of Philip Nguli Kivulu (Deceased) [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J). Upon demise of Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi, their estates were entitled to a 1/3 share each. Succession ought to have been sought separately for each 1/3 share. The parties will have to resolve the issue, by deciding on the way forward, for as it is, the cause herein is not tenable. Succession to 2 separate estates cannot be litigated in 1 succession cause. See In re Estate of Godfrey Kituku (Deceased) & Regina Mukui Ndaka (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Chitembwe, J) and In re Estate of Rolf Rainer Schmid (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Musyoka, J). The parties will have to decide on whether this cause should relate to the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, or that of Kironde Mukhwabi, but not both.9.The final order shall be that the application dated 16thApril 2024, shall not be determined in this ruling, instead it shall be canvassed simultaneously with the summons for revocation of grant, dated 28thSeptember 2023. The said revocation application shall be canvassed by way of viva voce evidence, based on the affidavits sworn by the parties and filed herein. In case the parties intend to call witnesses, who have not filed affidavits, they shall cause witness statements to be filed by those witnesses. There is a window, of 30 days, for the parties to file and exchange those witnesses’ statements, together with lists of witnesses, and lists and copies of the documents to be relied upon. The matter shall be mentioned on 14thOctober 2024, for compliance, and for allocation of a date for hearing.10.Orders accordinglyRULING DATED AND SIGNED AT BUSIA, AND DELIVERED VIA EMAIL, ON THIS 5THDAY OF SEPTEMBER 2024W MUSYOKAJUDGEMr. Arthur Etyang, Court Assistant.AdvocatesMr. Bwire, instructed by KOMM Advocates, Advocates for the administrator.Ms. Nabulindo, instructed DK Nabulindo & Company, Advocates for the applicant.",In re Estate of Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi (Deceased) (Succession Cause 110 of 1997) [2024] KEHC 10556 (KLR) (5 September 2024) (Ruling),Succession Cause 110 of 1997,"WM Musyoka, J","September 5, 2024",

That vide a letter dated 22ndNovember 2022, the landlord implored the tenant to pay his rent arrears then standing at 15 months.viii.That by 25thNovember 2022, the tenant had accumulated rent arrears of KES. 1,150,000 as per the landlord’s emails dated 8thNovember 2022 and 25thNovember 2022 which are annexed to pages 12 and 13 of the landlord’s list and bundle of exhibits.ix.That by letters dated 13thJuly 2022, 1stFebruary 2023 and 28thFebruary 2023, the tenant complained of an unfavorable business environment and requested for rent review, which the landlord conceded to by granting the tenant rent reduction from KES. 80,000 to KES. 50,000 which reduction was agreed upon in the tenancy agreement dated 5thApril 2023.x.That in light of the foregoing, with effect from 1stApril 2023 the rent was reduced to KES. 50,000.xi.That despite the landlord’s multiple reminders, the tenant persisted in his refusal to pay rent thereby causing the landlord to serve a notice of termination dated 14thMarch 2024 which is annexed at page 21 of the landlord’s list and bundle of exhibits.xii.That vide an email dated 27thMarch 2024, the tenant notified the landlord that the tenant would be moving out of the suit premises signaling compliance with the said notice.xiii.That the tenant is likely to hide or cart away the property in the suit premises thereby rendering it impossible for the landlord to recover the rent arrears.xiv.That the suit premises have remained locked by the tenant.xv.That the tenant is in arrears of KES. 1,669,500 according to the landlord’s statement of account.xvi.That the orders issued on 16thmay 2024 have tied the hands of the landlord by denying it the opportunity to mitigate the loss by repossessing the premises pursuant to the notice.xvii.That the tenant has not presented any payment plans to clear the rent arrears as alleged in the tenant’s reference.7.The landlord further filed grounds of opposition dated 23rdMay 2024 against the tenant’s notice of motion and reference dated 14thMay 2024 on grounds that the tenant is the one who had locked the suit premises and that the tenant has not disputed that he owes rent and has failed to show any evidence of a payment plan to demonstrate his commitment to clear the rent arrears among other grounds which have been stated in the supporting affidavit dated 22ndMay 2024 stated above.8.On 24thMay 2024, the court issued orders that the landlord’s application be served for hearing on 6thJune 2024.9.At a court hearing on 3rdJune 2024, the court issued orders that both applications in this matter be canvassed together by way of written submissions and the date issued for inter-partes hearing for the application dated 22ndMay 2024 was vacated.10.The tenant opposes the landlord’s application vide a replying affidavit dated 14thJune 2024 in which he deposes as follows; -i.That the landlord indeed issued a notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 which was to take effect on 15thMay 2024.ii.That a day after the issuance of the said notice, the tenant wrote to the landlord asking to be given a window to clear the said arrears as the tenant had found promising clients who were ready and willing to buy furniture and aid in easing the rent burden.iii.That the landlord despite the request above proceeded to close down the suit premises.iv.That the landlord and/or their agents informed the tenant that they no longer needed the said rent and they wanted the tenant out of the suit premises.v.That the tenant acknowledges the rent arrears owed to the landlord.vi.That the tenant owns goods whose worth is above KES. 2,500,000 still being held within the suit premises.vii.That the tenant had plans to pay all outstanding debts however the same was thwarted by the illegal actions of the landlord.11.The landlord filed a further affidavit dated 4thJuly 2024 in which it deposes that the allegations that he has goods worth KES. 2,500,000 within the suit premises is baseless as the tenant has not submitted any evidence to prove the said allegation.12.The landlord further deposes that at no time has the landlord ever informed the tenant that it no longer needed to be paid the rent or rent arrears owing from the tenant and that the tenant has failed to pay his rent and rent arrears.13.Both parties complied by filing their written submissions with the tenant filing his dated 14thJune 2024 and the landlord filling its submissions dated 4thJuly 2024. We shall consider both submissions as we deal with the issues for determination.B. Issues for determination14.The following are the issues for determination.a.Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 is valid and lawful.b.Whether the tenant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 14thMay 2024c.Whether the landlord is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 22ndMay 2024.d.Who shall bear the costs of both applications?Issue (a) Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 is valid and lawful.15.The landlord herein issued the tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 which was due to take effect on 15thMay 2024.16.The tenant in his replying affidavit dated 14thJune 2024 deposes that the said notice is illegal because the tenant was to vacate the premises after the lapse of 1 month which he states to be the 15thMay 2024.17.In the case of Manaver N Alibhai t/a Diani Boutique – vs- South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was held as follows: -“The Act lays down clearly in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated and no term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of any such tenancy shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”18.We have perused the notice to terminate tenancy subject matter herein and note that the same is dated 14thMarch 2024 and was expressed to take effect on 15thMay 2024, which constitutes a period 2 months as required by Cap 301 Laws of Kenya. In addition, we find that the notice is in the prescribed form according to Cap 301 Laws of Kenya.19.Consequently, we find that the said notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 is lawful and valid.Issue (b) Whether the tenant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 14thMay 2024.20.The tenant approached this tribunal seeking for restraining orders against the landlord from evicting or interfering with his occupation of the suit premises, that the landlord restores the tenant’s access to the suit premises and that the landlord be compelled to accept rent at the rate of KES. 50,000 per month or in the alternative, the tenant be allowed to pay the said rent to the tribunal.21.The tenant in his written submissions states that the landlord acted illegally by closing the premises a day after issuing the termination notice and that the mandatory period of 2 months had not lapsed.22.The landlord on the other hand states in its written submissions that it is not true that it had locked the suit premises as alleged and that the landlord believes that the tenant is the one who locked up the suit premises perhaps to avoid being followed up to pay the outstanding rent arrears. The landlord also deposes the same in its replying affidavit.23.We note that the court issued interim orders among other orders that the landlord restores the tenant’s access and control of the suit premises. During the hearings and mentions in this matter, the tenant did not at any time mention that the said orders had not been complied with. The tenant has also not presented any evidence to show that the said premises had been locked by the landlord.24.The tenant has also not denied that he owes the landlord the claimed rent arrears of KES. 1,669,500 as deposed in the landlord’s supporting affidavit dated 22ndMay 2024.25.In the case of Samuel Kipkori Ngeno and Another – vs- Local Authorities Pension Trust (Registered Trustees) & Another (2013) eKLR at paragraphs9and12, the court held as follows: -“9.A tenant’s first and main obligation is to pay rent as and when it becomes due for the landlord has the right to an income from his investment. Why would a tenant allow himself to fall into such huge arrears of rent”?“12.The temporary injunction sought in the present application is an equitable remedy at the court’s discretion. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands. A tenant who is in huge arrears of rent is underserving of the court’s discretion. The court cannot be refuge of a tenant who fails to meet his principal obligation of paying rent as and when it becomes due”.26.Despite the alleged closure of the suit premises by the landlord, the foregoing case provides sufficient guidance in directing that the tenant pays rent arrears owed to the landlord and in default the court shall direct that the landlord be at liberty to use lawful means to recover the same.27.Based on the establishment that the notice to terminate tenancy is legal, the tribunal is not able to grant orders compelling the landlord to accept rent from the tenant.28.Consequently, the tribunal shall order that the application dated 14thMay 2024 be dismissed with costs to the landlord/respondent.Issue (c) Whether the landlord is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 22ndMay 2024.29.The landlord filed the application dated 22ndMay 2024 seeking for orders that the tribunal vacates orders made on 16thMay 2024, that the landlord be allowed to break into the suit premises for purposes of taking an inventory of the property/items therein and thereafter keep such property in safe custody pending hearing and determination of the matter and that the court issue orders of compensation to the landlord for loss and damage due to the tenant’s reference.30.The landlord in his written submissions has directed the court to paragraph 16 of its replying affidavit where the landlord states as follows; -“… by email dated 27th March 2024, the tenant/applicant effectively notified the landlord/respondent that the tenant/applicant would be moving out of the demised premises, thereby signalling that the tenant/applicant had agreed to comply with the said Tenancy Notice dated 14th March 2024. Particularly, the tenant/applicant stated thus:“… our clients have turned up with high value business propositions that can allow us to settle the arrears in a couple of months even as we prepare to move out … Meanwhile the CEO/Manager Concept Mahogany will furnish you with a payment plan to demonstrate our commitment to clear the arrears and move on …”31.We agree with the landlord in that the statement above is an indication that the tenant had agreed to comply with the said termination notice from the onset.32.Upon perusal of the documents filed in this matter, there is no evidence of the proposed rent arrears payment plan by the tenant to show his willingness to pay the said rent arrears.33.Furthermore, the tenant has not filed any reference under Section 6 of Cap 301, Laws of Kenya to oppose the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024.34.Section 6 of the Act states;“A receiving party who wishes to oppose a tenancy notice, and who has notified the requesting party under section 4(5) of this Act that he does not agree to comply with the tenancy notice, may, before the date upon which such notice is to take effect, refer the matter to a Tribunal, whereupon such notice shall be of no effect until, and subject to, the determination of the reference by the Tribunal”35.Based on the above analysis, the court finds that the landlord is deserving of the orders sought in the application dated 22ndMay 2024 and this court shall vacate the orders issued on 16thMay 2024.Issue (d) Who shall bear the costs of both applications?36.As regards costs, the same are in the Tribunal’s discretion under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall award costs to the landlord/respondent.C. Orders37.Given the above analysis, the final orders which commend to us are;a.The Notice to terminate tenancy dated 14thMarch 2024 is hereby upheld and the tenant’s tenancy in respect to the suit premises is hereby terminated.b.The application dated 14thMay 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs to the landlord/respondent.c.The reference dated 14thMay 2024 is settled in terms.d.The landlord’s application dated 22ndMay 2024 is hereby allowed in terms of prayer 2.e.The tenant shall vacate the suit premises within the next 21 days and in default shall be forcibly evicted therefrom by a Licensed Auctioneer who shall be provided with security by the OCS Kisumu Central Police Station.f.The tenant is liable to pay rent arrears owing to the landlord up to and including the date of such vacation or eviction and in default, the landlord is at liberty to use all lawful means to recover rent arrears against the tenant.g.The tenant shall pay costs of Kshs.50,000/- to the landlord.It is so ordered.RULING DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED VIRTUALLY THIS 29THAUGUST 2024HON.

Parties And Representatives1.The Applicant, Granada Energy Limited, has rented space for purposes of operating a petrol station business (“the Tenant”) erected on Plot No. 27 situated in Old Town Mavoko within Machakos (the “suit property”).2.The firm of B.V. Francis & Associates Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.3.The Respondent, Felista Kanini Maundu, is the Landlady and owner of the suit property who rented out the suit property to the Tenant (the “Landlady”).4.The firm of Onwong’a Nyakeriga & Co. Advocates represents the Landlady in this matter.B. The Dispute Background5.Vide a Reference dated 27thMay 2024 and an Application evenly dated, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking to raise an objection to the Landlady’s Notice to Vacate dated 13thMay 2024.6.On 28thMay 2024, the Tribunal in consideration of the Tenant’s Application, certified the matter as urgent and granted restraining orders against the Landlady from interfering with the Tenant’s quiet possession of the suit property pending hearing. The OCS Mavoko Police Station was ordered to ensure compliance.7.Subsequently, the Tenant filed an Application for review on the orders dated 28thMay 2024 on the grounds that the orders be addressed to the OCS Athi-river police station instead of OCS Mavoko police station as previously ordered. Consequently, on 5thJune 2024, the Tribunal granted the orders sought by the Tenant thereby directing the OCS Athi River Police Station to ensure compliance.8.Following this, the Landlady filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 10thJune 2024 on the grounds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine this suit.9.During the hearing on 8thJuly 2024 in the presence of the Counsels for both parties, the Tribunal directed parties to file their submissions. On 25thJuly 2024, the Tenant confirmed to this Tribunal that parties have complied and filed their submissions. Therefore, it is in respect of the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 27thMay 2024 that this matter comes for ruling.C. Tenant’s Claim10.The Tenant avers that the Landlady’s termination notice dated 13thMay 2024 is defective as it purports to issue a 16 days’ notice instead of a 30 days’ notice in accordance to the Lease Agreement dated 1stAugust 2023 between the Tenant and the Landlady.11.The Tenant also avers that it has always been remitting rent within reasonable period to the Landlady’s bank account. As such, the Tenant denies owing any rent arrears. The Tenant avers that upon execution of the Agreement, the Tenant duly paid to the Landlady the sum of Kshs. 780,000/= as rent for a period of 6 months in which it has annexed bank payment receipt as evidence. Additionally, the Tenant avers in paragraph 6 of its Supporting Affidavit that it made further payment of Kshs. 800,000/= to the Landlady as rent for a further 6 months as allegedly agreed to which it adduced proof of bank receipt.12.In response to the Landlady’s Replying Affidavit dated 10thJune 2024, the Tenant avers under paragraph 9 of its Further Affidavit that the allegations for a refund of Kshs. 250,000/= by the Landlady is not true. The Tenant depones that the said amounts paid by the Landlady was in partial satisfaction of a claim for Kshs. 300,000/= which loss was occasioned by the Landlady’s son as a result of an offence of stealing by servant which was reported to the Police and an OB Number issued.13.The Tenant contends that the Landlady is in contempt of the orders dated 28thMay 2024. The Tenant avers that despite proper service of the Court Orders, the Landlady has occasioned damage of the Tenant’s property as evidenced in the photographs attached therewith.14.Further, the Tenant avers that the Landlady has occasioned loss of business and hindered business operations through the illegal actions of the Landlady to rent out the suit property to a third party during the existence a binding Agreement between the parties.D. Landlady’s Claim15.In response, the Landlady alleges that despite the Tenant being in breach of the Agreement her pleas have gone unheard. Under paragraph 9 of the Respondent’s Replying Affidavit, the Landlady disputes that she has neither held conversation with the Tenant nor made arrangements to accept any partial rent payment as alleged by the Tenant.16.The Landlady alleges that it is the Tenant who initiated request for refund of the balance of rent and to find another tenant. To salvage the suit property from wasting away, the Landlady avers that she issued a notice to the Tenant to vacate.17.The Landlady avers that upon the alleged refund of Kshs. 250,000/= to the Tenant on 30thMay 2024, the Tenant handed possession to the Landlady and willingly vacated the suit property. As a result, the Landlady depones that the tenancy relationship does not exist.18.The Landlady also avers that she has incurred damages of Kshs. 64,500/= as cost of repair as evidenced in the attachment to her replying affidavit.E. Issues For Determination19.Upon perusal, I find the following to be the main issues for determination:i.Whether there exists any tenancy relationship between the Landlord and the Tenant;ii.Whether the termination notice dated 13thMay 2024 is enforceable; andiii.Whether the Tenant is entitled to the reliefs sought.F. Analysis And FindingsWhether there exists any tenancy relationship between the Landlord and the Tenant20.The Landlord and Tenant (Sops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (“the Act”) confers power to this Honourable Tribunal to deal with the issue on jurisdiction which the Landlady has raised in her Preliminary Objection and also as part of her Grounds of Opposition. Section 12 of the Act states that:(1)A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power—(a)to determine whether or not any tenancy is a controlled tenancy;21.Further, Section 2 of the Act, defines a controlled tenancy as;tenancy of a shop, hotel or catering establishment-b)Which has not been reduced into writing; orc)Which has been reduced into writing and which-i.Is for a period not exceeding five years; orii.Contains provision for termination, otherwise than for breach of covenant, within five years from the commencement thereof; oriii.Relates to premises of a class specified under subsection 2 of this section.Provided that no tenancy to which the Government, the Community or a local authority is a party, whether as landlord or as tenant, shall be a controlled tenancy;23.In the instant case, it is not in dispute that parties entered into a Lease Agreement dated 1stAugust 2023 (“the Agreement”) to lease the suit property for a term of 1 year 11 months effective 1stAugust 2023 until 1stJuly 2025 at a monthly rent of Kshs. 130,000/=. Subsequently, the Tenant took vacant possession of the suit property upon payment of Kshs. 780,000/= to the Landlady as rent for the initial 6 months upfront which is in consonance with the agreed terms. The Landlady under paragraph 7 of her Replying Affidavit has acknowledged receipt of the said amounts to which the Tenant has adduced a copy of the bank receipt in support of its claim.24.Based on the existence of a duly executed written Agreement, I am satisfied that the tenancy relationship between the parties herein culminate to a controlled tenancy which this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and make orders. Therefore, I am convinced that the claims as raised by the Landlady in her Preliminary Objection as well as the Grounds of Opposition are without basis as the dispute herein relates to issues which arose during, or are akin to, a controlled tenancy.Whether the termination notice dated 13thMay 2024 is enforceable25.Section 4 of the Act provides as follows:“A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy or to alter to the detriment of the tenant any term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under such a tenancy shall give notice in that behalf in the prescribed form”.26.In the case of Manaver N. Alibhai T/A Diani Boutique vs. South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited, Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was stated as follows;“The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought.”27.Having established that the tenancy in this case relates to a controlled tenancy, the Landlady is obliged to issue a valid termination notice to the Tenant in the prescribed from failure to which the notice shall not be enforceable.28.In the circumstances, the Landlady issued the Tenant with a Notice to Vacate vide a letter dated 13thMay 2024 which was to take effect on the 31stMay 2024 upon which the Tenant was required to give vacant possession to the Landlady.29.The Agreement under clause 10 requires the Landlady to issue a 30 days’ written notice to the Tenant on condition that there has to be a failure on the part of the Tenant to rectify the breach within 60 days upon receipt of a written notice from the Landlady. In the absence of a 60 days’ notice to the Tenant to rectify the breach and a further 30 days as agreed, the Landlady’s notice is not in the correct form as it is neither within the prescribed statutory period nor within the period as agreed in the Agreement.30.Taking turn on the substantive issue, the Landlady seeks vacant possession of the suit property on the grounds of breach of clause 3(i) which the Tenant is obliged under the Agreement to make upfront payment of the initial 6 months’ rent being Kshs. 780,000/=. From the facts, the Landlady has not adduced any evidence to buttress her claim for non-payment. Conversely, the Tenant has adduced a copy of the bank receipt as proof of payment of the amounts under clause 3(i) to which the Landlady has admitted under paragraph 7 of her Replying Affidavit.Whether the Tenant is entitled to the reliefs sought.31.Section 12 of the Act authorizes this Honourable Tribunal to make various orders which, inter alia, include:(e)to make orders, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, for the recovery of possession and for the payment of arrears of rent and mesne profits, which orders may be applicable to any person, whether or not he is a tenant, being at any material time in occupation of the premises comprised in a controlled tenancy;(l)to award compensation for any loss incurred by a tenant on termination of a controlled tenancy in respect of goodwill, and improvements carried out by the tenant with the landlord’s consent”32.Having determined that the Landlady’s Notice to Vacate is invalid thus unlawful, the Tenant is entitled to compensation for loss incurred upon the unlawful termination of the controlled tenancy by the Landlady. Notably, the Tenant has merely quoted as costs the value of the signages destroyed. However, there is no proof either payment receipt or document to show the value of the property.33.Further, the Tenant claims reimbursement of Kshs. 260,000/= as rent paid in upfront for the period in which the Tenant was not in occupation the suit property. It is noteworthy to consider upon lapse of the initial 6 months period on 31stJanuary 2024, the Tenant paid in advance Kshs. 800,000/= to the Landlady’s account and adduced a copy of the payment receipt. Accordingly, the Landlady is only entitled to the rent from 1stFebruary 2024 until 30thMay 2024 in which the Tenant was in occupation of the suit property being Kshs. 520,000/= and the balance of Kshs. 280,000/= be refunded since the Tenant is no longer in occupation of the suit property.34.On the issue of repairs, the Landlady has adduced an invoice in the sum of Kshs. 64,500/= as proof of the damages incurred during the subsistence of the tenancy. Notably, the Tenant has neither denied nor disputed any of the amounts in the Landlady’s invoice. Further, on the issue of contempt, the Tribunal takes note that the Tenant has vacated the suit property and is no longer in occupation thus the Tribunal cannot purport to act in vain since the orders are overtaken by events.G. Orders35.In the upshot, the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 27thMay 2024 is hereby allowed in the following terms:i.Landlady to offset the amounts as costs for repair as Kshs. 64,500/= from the balance of Kshs. 280,000.00;ii.Landlady to refund to the Tenant within 30 days from the date hereof rent balance of Kshs. 215,500.00; andiii.Each party shall bear its own costs.HON.

The said legal guardians, a married couple, signed a consent dated 29 January 2024 indicating their willingness to step in and care for the child in the event the Applicants are unable to provide for the child.14.From the material availed, I am satisfied that the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.Analysis and Determination15.Article 14 (4) ofThe Constitutionprovides as follows:A child found in Kenya who is, or appears to be, less than 8 years of age, and whose nationality and parents are not know, is presumes to be a citizen by birth.16.The child was abandoned within the Republic of Kenya a few days after he was born. I, therefore, declare that the child is a citizen of Kenya by birth.17.The child was abandoned and all efforts by the police to trace the child’s parents/relatives have borne no fruit. The letter dated 11 November 2019 from Kenyatta Police Post, Nairobi indicates that efforts to trace the child’s parents have yielded no positive results. In the circumstances, there exists no known person from whom consent for this adoption can be sought and/or obtained. I, therefore, waive this requirement in line with section 185 (4)(b) of theChildren Act, Cap 141 of the Laws of Kenya.18.In deciding any matter involving a child, the court is obligated to give priority to the best interest of the child. Section 8 of theChildren Actprovides:1.In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies –a.The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;b.The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule;2.All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to:-a.Safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;b.Conserve and promote the welfare of the child; andc.Secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in the public interest.19.This child who was abandoned soon after birth faced an uncertain future in the children’s homes and other similar institutions. This adoption, therefore, allows the child the opportunity to be raised in a stable and loving home environment.20.I have considered the Reports filed by the Adoption Agency, the Guardian ad litem, the Director of Children Services, all of which were positive and recommended the adoption. It is, therefore, my view that the adoption does serve the best interests of the child.21.Accordingly, I allow the Summons and make the following orders:i.That the Applicants, A.A. and C.C.C, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby EH ;ii.Upon adoption, the child shall be renamed as I.C.A;iii.The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges underthe Constitutionof Kenya and all applicable laws;iv.K. M. K. And E.K.O.M are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,v.The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;vi.That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 29 DAY OF AUGUST 2024HELENE R.

      [2024] KEHC 10481 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at Nairobi (Milimani Law Courts)FamilyMiscellaneous Case E138 of 2024H Namisi, JAugust 29, 2024IN THE MATTER OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT, CAP 248 OF THE LAWS OF KENYAANDIN THE MATTER OF M.C.M (PERSON SUFFERING FROM MENTAL DISABILITY)In the matter ofMCMSubjectandKNMPetitionerJudgment1.The Petition before the Court was brought by KNM, being the sister to the subject, MCM. MCM is a 39-year-old man residing in Donholm with his sister, the Petitioner. The Petition which is brought under sections 26 (1), 27 and 27 of theMental Health Act, is supported by an Affidavit sworn by the Petitioner, as well as annextures thereto. In the Affidavit, the Petitioner depones that she is the primary care giver to MCM, who suffers from intellectual and convulsive disorder, rendering him incapable of managing his affairs.2.At the hearing of the Petition, the Petitioner testified that there is no other living sibling or parent to care for MCM. It was her testimony that MCM suffers from convulsions and is forgetful. The convulsions began in 2017 after their mother passed on. The subject has been treated at Mathare National Teaching and Referral Hospital, where he was diagnosed with Intellectual Disability. The subject was examined by Dr. Kamunge and a report dated 8th August 2022 was submitted to the National Council of Persons with Disability (Annexture KNM1).3.Additionally, the Petitioner presented a letter dated 8th August 2022 from Dr. Kamunge to the Standard Chartered Bank informing the Bank of the subject’s condition. The Petitioner also presented a Medical Assessment Report for Persons with Disability from the Ministry of Health.4.I had an opportunity to speak to the Subject and I am persuaded that this Petition is properly before the Court.5.Section 26 of the said Act states that:1)The court may make orders—(a)for the management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder; and(b)for the guardianship of any person suffering from mental disorder by any near relative or by any other suitable person.(2)Where there is no known relative or other suitable person, the court may order that the Public Trustee be appointed manager of the estate and guardian of any such person.(3)Whereupon inquiry it is found that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder to such an extent as to be incapable of managing his affairs, but that he is capable of managing himself and is not dangerous to himself or to others or likely to act in a manner offensive to public decency, the court may make such orders as it may think fit for the management of the estate of such person, including proper provision for his maintenance and for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for maintenance, but need not, in such case, make any order as to the custody of the person suffering from mental disorder6.I have also considered all the material placed before me. It is apparent that the subject suffers from a mental disorder and that he is incapable of managing his own affairs, although he is not dangerous to himself.7.The definition in Section 2 of the Act provides that:“A person suffering from mental disorder” means a person who has been found to be suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol or substance abuse.”8.In the circumstances, the court makes a finding that the subject is a person suffering from a mental disorder within the definition of theMental Health Actand hereby appoints the Petitioner as the subject’s guardian. Additionally, the court appoints the said Petitioner as general manager of the estate of the subject. For the avoidance of doubt, such manager’s general powers will not include the power of alienation, sale or transfer of the subject’s immovable assets but will include all the powers necessary for the management of such and other assets, and to plead and prosecute and/or defend any action brought by or against the subject in respect of any of the assets forming part of his estate.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 29 DAY OF AUGUST 2024HELENE R.

Parties And Their Representatives1.The Applicant, John Kingori Andre Macharia, is the lawful owner of the suit premises erected on Plot No. Aguthi/Gatitu 2070 situate within Nyeri County in the Republic of Kenya.2.The Firm of Maina Kimumu & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.3.The Respondent, Peter Munuria Kioi, rented the suit premises and hence is a lawful tenant thereto.4.The Firm of Karweru & Company Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.B. Dispute Background5.On 6thOctober 2024, Landlord served the Tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy dated 4thOctober 2024 on the basis that the Tenant was in rent arrears amounting to KShs. 68,000.00. However, the Tenant did not object to the said notice and failed to vacate the suit premises on the effective date of the notice, 1stJanuary 2024.6.Consequently, the Landlord moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and Notice of Motion dated 10thJanuary 2024 seeking Orders certifying the matter as urgent, terminating the tenancy between him and the Tenant and consequently issue an eviction order against the Tenant, and break in orders should the Tenant restrain the Landlord from accessing the suit premises. Further, the Landlord prayed that the OCS Ruring’u Police Station to enforce the Orders of this Tribunal in this matter.7.The Tribunal through an Order dated 11thJanuary 2024 certified the matter as urgent and set the matter for hearing on 8thFebruary 2024 and further directed the Landlord to file an Affidavit of Service as proof of service, which the Landlord did on 9thJanuary 2024.8.On 8thFebruary 2024, this Court allowed the Landlord’s Application dated 10thJanuary 2024 terminating the Tenancy between Landlord and the Tenant herein in the absence of the Tenant and marked the matter as settled.9.The Tenant subsequently filed an Application under a Certificate of Urgency dated 27thFebruary 2024 seeking to have the Orders of this Court dated 8thFebruary 2024 terminating the Tenancy between him and the Landlord and any other consequential orders thereto stayed, set aside or vacated.10.It is the Tenant’s Application dated 27thFebruary 2024 that is the subject of this Ruling.C. The Tenant’s Case11.The Tenant’s Application is based on the grounds that he was not served with the notice of termination as alleged by the Landlord and hence, the said notice is ineffective.12.Further, the Tenant in his submissions dated 12thJuly 2024, submits that he was not served with the Application dated 10thJanuary 2024 and that the Orders of 8thFebruary 2024 were issued in his absentia thereby denying him an opportunity to participate in the proceedings.13.The Tenant therefore prays that this Court stays, sets aside and vacates its Orders dated 8thFebruary 2024 and direct the Landlord to allow his access to the suit premises.D. The Respondents’ Case14.In his replying affidavit dated 15thMay 2024, the Landlord avers that the Tenant was duly served with both the notice to terminate the Tenancy dated 4thOctober 2023 and the Reference and Application dated 10thJanuary 2024, but deliberately failed to respond to the said notice of termination and to enter appearance to defend the matter.15.The Tenant avers that following the Orders of this Court dated 8thFebruary 2024, the Tenant vacated the premises on his own volition and took all his items through his authorized agents.16.It is the Landlord’s case therefore that this Tribunal lacks the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter since the tenancy has already determined and the suit premises let to another person currently running a fish eatery business.E. Issues For Determination17.I have given full consideration to the Tenant’s Notice of Motion Application dated 27thFebruary 2024 and Respondents’ Replying Affidavit dated 15thMay 2024. It is my considered opinion that the sole issue that falls for determination is:Whether this Tribunal should stay, review and/or suspend the enforcement and/or execution of the Orders issued delivered on 8thFebruary 2024 and all consequential processes arising therefrom.F. Analysis And Determination18.Pursuant to Section 12 of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Cap 301 Laws of Kenya, this Court is clothed with the requisite jurisdiction to entertain an Application to stay, set aside or vacate its own Orders. It states;A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power—i.to vary or rescind any order made by the Tribunal under the provisions of this Act;19.The power to review is also provided for under Section 80 of theCivil Procedure ActCap 21 which provides that: -“Any person who considers himself aggrieved—a.by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; orb.by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.”20.Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides for the threshold to be met in an application for review. It provides that: -“1.(1)Any person considering himself aggrieved—a.by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; orb.by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”21.In elaborating Section 80 of theCivil Procedure ActCap 21 and Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 the Court in Republic v Public ProcurementAdministrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] eKLR held that: -“Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”22.Similarly, inRepublic v Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal Ex parte Apollo Mboya [2019] eKLR High Court of Kenya Nairobi Judicial Review Division Misc. Application No. 317 of 2018Mativo J culled out the following principles from a number of authorities including: -i.……………….ii.The expression ""any other sufficient reason"" appearing in Order 45 Rule 1 has to be interpreted in the light of other specified grounds.23.I am well aware that the power to review is discretionary. I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pancras T. Swai v Kenya Breweries Limited [2014] eKLR where the Court held: -“Order 44 rule 1 (now Order 45 rule 1 in the 2010 Civil Procedure Rules) gave the trial Court discretionary power to allow review on the three limps therein stated or “for any sufficient reason...”24.I have considered all materials placed before this Court and note that in deed, the Orders of the Court dated 8thFebruary 2024 were issued in the absence of the Tenant. However, I note that the Landlord filed a return of service being proof that service was effected on the Tenant.25.Further, I note that despite the Landlord indicates that the Tenant vacated and he has already let the suit premises to someone else, thereby terminating the tenancy between the parties herein. This, the Tenant has not denied. In the circumstances, this Tribunal lacks the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.G. Determination26.In the upshot, the Tenant’s Application and reference dated 27thFebruary 2024 is hereby dismissed. Each party to bear their own costs.HON.

Parties And Their Representatives1.The Applicant, Anytime Limited, is a proprietor of a wholesale and distribution business in a Go-Down owned by the Landlord within Eldoret Town in the Republic of Kenya.2.The Firm of E. Kinyanjui & Co. Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.3.The Respondent, Mohib Teherali Abdul Hussein is the owner of the Go-Down rented by the Tenant herein and hence the Landlord.4.The Firm of W. Kevin Michuki & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.B. Dispute Background5.The Tenant moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and a Notice of Motion Application dated 9thFebruary 2024 seeking orders certifying the matter as urgent, restraining the Landlord and his agents, servants and/or personal representatives from levying distress against the Tenant and declaring the distrain for rent illegal, irregular invalid and incompetent.6.When the matter came up for hearing on 19thFebruary 2024, the parties recorded a consent agreeing to open a joint interest earning account within 7 days wherein the Tenant would deposit rent arrears in the sum of KShs. 800,000.00 pending the determination of rent owing and issuance of ETR receipts. Further, the Court directed that parties exchange statements of accounts within 14 days and that the Tenant pays rent for the month of March before the next hearing date.7.On 3rdApril 2024, the parties confirmed that they had opened a joint interest earning account and that the Tenant had deposited the rent arrears owing but the Landlord was yet to issue the Tennant with an ETR Receipt.8.Consequently, the Tenant’s Reference and Application were settled by consent on condition that the amount deposited in the joint account be released to the Landlord upon issuance of ETR Receipts and invoices to the Tenant’s Advocates for onward transmission to the Tenant. As such, the Landlord undertook to issue the ETR Receipts upon payment of rent within 5 days and that the said undertaking would lapse within 3 months and the Landlord to keep issuing ETR Receipts upon payment of rent.9.Subsequently, the Tenant filed an Application dated 2ndMay 2024 under a certificate of urgency seeking orders certifying the matter as urgent, restraining the Landlord and its agents, Eshikhoni Auctioneers from levying distress on the Tenant pending the hearing and determination of the Application and orders declaring the distrain from rent undertaken on 29thApril 2024.10.The Landlord filed an Application dated 9thMay 2024 seeking orders compelling the Tenant’s Advocates to sign RTGS forms for releasing the rent arrears deposited in the joint account to the Landlord and in the alternative, the branch manager African Banking Corporation Ltd Bank be ordered to release the amount of rent arrears.11.It is the Tenant’s Application dated 2ndMay 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 9thMay 2024 that are the subject of this ruling.C. The Tenant’s Case12.The Tenant’s Application is based on the grounds that at the beginning of 2023, the Landlord instructed it to pay part rent of KShs. 80,000.00 by cheque while a further amount of KShs. 160,000.00 was to be paid in cash to various phone numbers as provided by the Landlord until November 2023 when the Tenant requested to be furnished ETR Receipts for the period between 2021 to 2023.13.It is the Tenant’s case that it stopped paying KShs. 160,000.00 as the Landlord was not willing to give ETR receipts in respect of that amount. Consequently, the Tenant agrees that the arrears owing amount to KShs. 800,000.00 which it has deposited in a joint interest earning account in light of the consent Order dated 3rdApril 2024 and which amount is to be released upon issuance of ETR receipts by the Landlord.14.The Tenant submits that it is unfair for the Landlord to be allowed to distress for rent while he has failed to comply with the Consent Order to enable the Tenant’s Advocates to release the funds to him.D. The Landlords’ Case15.The Landlord claims that he has issued the Invoices and ETR Receipts to the Tenant’s Advocates on 17thApril 2024 but the Tenant’s Advocates failed to release funds to him contrary to the Consent Order dated 3rdApril 2024.16.It is the Landlord’s case that the Tenant’s fresh demands to issue receipts from 2021 to 2023 does not absolve the Tenant from paying rent and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate on tax matters.E. Issues For Determination17.I have given full consideration to the Tenant’s Notice of Motion Application 2ndMay 2024, the Landlord’s Application dated 9thMay 2024, and all other materials placed before this Court. It is my considered opinion that the following issues fall for determination:a.Whether the consent order dated 3rdApril 2024 should be set asideb.Whether the amount held in the interest earning escrow account should be released to the Landlord?F. Analysis And Determinationa.Whether the consent order dated 3rdApril 2024 should be set aside18.I note that the principles that appertain to setting aside of a consent order are well established in a line of cases including Brooke Bond Liebig vs Mallya (1975) EA 266 where Mustafa Ag. VP stated thus;“The compromise agreement was made an order of the court and was thus a consent judgment. It is well settled that a consent judgment can be set aside only in certain circumstances, e.g on grounds of fraud or collusion, that there was no consensus between the parties, public policy or for such reasons as would enable a court to set aside or rescind a contract. In this case the parties and their advocates consented to the compromise in very clear terms; they were certainly aware of all the material facts and there could not have been any mistake or misunderstanding. None of the factors which could give rise to the setting aside of a consent agreement existed.”19.I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Board of Trustees National Social Security Fund versus Micheal Mwalo [2015] eKLR where the Court gave the grounds upon which consent judgment may be set aside in the case of as follows;“The law pertaining to setting aside of consent judgments or consent orders has been clearly stated. A Court of law will not interfere with a consent judgment except in circumstances such as would provide a good ground for varying or rescinding a contract between parties. To impeach a consent order or a consent judgment, it must be shown that it was obtained by fraud, or collusion or by an agreement contrary to the policy of Court.”20.In the instant case, the Tenant insists that the Landlord has failed to comply with the Consent Orders of this Honorable Court by failing to issue ETR receipts for the period between 2021 and 2023 and that the same should be set aside and its Reference heard on merit.21.I note that on the other hand, the Landlord insists that he issued the ETR receipts as required vide a letter dated 17thApril 2024 which lists the ETR receipt for KShs. 110,344.83, invoice dated 11thApril 2024 for KShs. 800,000.00, Invoice dated 21stMarch 2024 for KShs. 240,000 for the rent for March, Invoice dated 10thApril 2024 for KShs. 240,000 for the rent for April and an RTGS Application form dated 18thApril 2024.22.It is clear that the Landlord has not provided any ETR receipts for the period between 2021 to 2023 as well as for the months of March and April 2024. In fact, the Landlord believes that the Tenant’s demand for ETR receipts for the period between 2021 and 2023 amounts to a fresh demand.23.In the circumstances, it is my opinion that at the time of recording the Consent Order, there was a misunderstanding as to the period for which the ETR receipts were to be issued. I am therefore convinced that the Consent Order dated 3rdApril 2024 ought to be set aside to allow this Court to make a determination on the matter.b.Whether the amount should be released to the Landlord.24.Having set aside the Consent Order, is noteworthy that the Landlord he has to pay the amount in advance to generate the ETR receipt. I note that the Landlord has already issued a receipt in respect of the amount held in the escrow account. In the circumstances, is only fair that the Tenant releases the rent arrears in the escrow account to the Landlord.25.However, I note that the Landlord has issued the invoices but is yet to issue the ETR receipts for the months of March and April which he ought to have done by now.c.Whether the Landlord should be allowed to levy distress for rent26.Pursuant to Section 3 of theDistress for Rent Act, Cap 292 Laws of Kenya, the landlord has a right to levy distress for rent as follows:“Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other written law, any person having any rent or rent service in arrear and due upon a grant, lease, demise or contract shall have the same remedy by distress for the recovery of that rent or rent service as is given by the common law of England in a similar case.”27.However, this right must be exercised according to the Law. In this instance, the rent arrears owing is not in dispute. In fact, the Tenant had demonstrated goodwill and complied with the consent order by depositing KShs. 800,000.00 being the arrears owing.28.Therefore, it is quite unfair for the Landlord to distress for rent when the Tenant has already paid the arrears into an escrow account and which amount was to be released upon complying with the Consent Order. I therefore find the proclamation dated 29thApril to be illegal.G. DeterminationH.In the upshot, the Tenant’s Application and Reference dated 2ndMay 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 9thMay 2024 are hereby partially allowed in the following terms:a.The Consent Order dated3rdApril 2024is hereby set aside;b.The Landlord is hereby restrained form levying distress for rent;c.The rent arrears in the escrow account shall be released to the Landlord who shall within 7 days issue ETR Receipts failure to which the Tenant shall be at liberty to withhold further rent payment and apply for further directions;d.The Tenant shall continue paying rent on or before the 5thof every month and ETR shall follow within 5 days, failure to which the Tenant shall be at liberty to withhold further rent payment and apply for further directions; ande.Each party to bear their own costs.HON.

Background Of The Dispute5.The tenants moved this Tribunal by away of a Notice of Motion dated 28thMay 2024 under certificate of urgency of even date. The tenants sought, inter alia, injunction orders restraining the 2ndrespondent from evicting, attempting to evict, attaching, selling or interfering with the tenant’s business premises.6.The tenants claim that the 2ndrespondent unreasonably issued a notice threatening to demolish their shops through a letter dated 24thMay 2024 addressed to Buruburu Police Station attached to the application as SNT 1. They further aver that it seems there is a land ownership dispute between the 1stand the 2ndrespondent which should not affect them. CMELC NO. E193 OF 2022.7.Accordingly, the tribunal on 4thJune 2024 ordered that the applicant to serve the Application for inter partes hearing on 11thJune 2024.8.The 2ndrespondent responded to the tenants claims through a replying affidavit dated 19thJuly 2024. He claims that notice to vacate the suit premises was duly issued on 1stJuly 2024 to the tenants and that 6 tenants had already vacated the suit premises. However, there is no attachment of the said notice to this tribunal.9.The 2ndrespondent further avers that he owns the piece of land upon which the suit premises is built and requests the tribunal to summon Mr. Phillip Odengo, the 1strespondent to produce the documents before the honorable tribunal to verify his ownership of the piece of land.C. Issues For Determination10.Having carefully perused the Application and Responses presented by parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the issues for determination before this honorable tribunal are:a.Whether Notice to Vacate the Suit Premises issued by the 2ndrespondent valid?b.Whether this tribunal has the requisite jurisdictions to summon the 1strespondent to produce documents to verify legal ownership of the land in which the suit premises are situated?D.

Whether the Notice to Vacate the suit premises issued by the 2ndrespondent valid?11.Notice of termination of tenancy is a matter of law under Section 4 (2) of theLandlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter “the Act”) and must be taken into consideration by both parties in a tenancy relationship.12.The position of the law on the issue of termination notice is now settled. The court in Manaver N. Alibahai T/A Diani Boutique vs South Coast Fitness 7 & Sports Centre Ltd, Civil Appeal No. 203n of 1994, stated that:“The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in Form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”13.It is evident that the letter addressed to the Buruburu Police Station dated 24thMay 2024 herein was not in the prescribed form by the Act. Further, the termination letter did not specify when the eviction was to take place as it indicated at paragraph2; “...…. that any day from now, I will be removing some illegal structures built in my plot….” And that there is no tenancy relationship between the tenants and the 2ndrespondent.14.Hence, it is my finding that the Notice issued does not meet the requirement of the Act and therefore invalid. Accordingly, I will proceed to address the 2ndissue.b.           Whether this tribunal has jurisdictions to summon the 1strespondent to produce documents to verify legal ownership of the land in which the suit premises is situated?15.The 2ndrespondent has invited this honorable Tribunal to summon the 1strespondent to produce documents to prove ownership of the land upon which the suit premises is built. It is therefore necessary for the tribunal to determine whether it is within its confine to grant such orders.16.This tribunal is a creature of the statute and derives its powers from the statute that creates it. Its jurisdiction is thus limited by the statute. It can only do that which statute empowered it to do since its powers are express and cannot be implied. It is with that in mind that I find that under Section 12 of the Act, this tribunal can only determine disputes relating to:i.The amount of rent payable by a tenant;ii.The termination of tenancy;iii.The recovery of possession of a business premises by a landlord; andiv.Any other matter relating to business premises rent.17.Based on the above analysis, I find that this tribunal lacks jurisdiction over land ownership disputes, which fall within the exclusive purview of the Environment and Land Court.18.Before a determination is therefore made in CMELC NO E193 OF 2022 the presumption as to ownership will remain on the occupant of the land in this case Philip 1stRespondent unless there is an express order to the contrary from the Magistrates Court granting 2ndRespondent the said rights even on a temporary basis.E. Orders19.In the upshot, the Tenants’ Application dated 28thMay 2024 is hereby allowed in the following terms:i.The eviction notice issued by the 2ndrespondent through a letter dated 24thMay 2024 is invalid;ii.The 2ndrespondent is hereby restrained from evicting, attempting to evict, attaching, selling or interfering in any way with the tenants ‘business premises until the dispute on ownership of the land upon which the suit premises is built is determined by a competent court with requisite jurisdiction;iii.The tenants to continue paying rent to whoever they have been paying;iv.The OCS Buruburu Police Station to ensure compliance; andv.Each party to bear their cost.HON A.

Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter3.Rachel Mburu (the “Landlord”) is the registered owner of all that premises erected on land parcel no. Thika Majengo Block 11/233.4.The Landlord appears in person.B. Background Of The Dispute5.Through a Reference and an Application dated 19thSeptember, 2022 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Landlord be compelled to reopen the suit premises and allow the Tenant free access to the premises and failure to open the Tenant to break and gain access with the assistance of the OCS Thika Police Station, the Landlord be restrained from evicting, harassing and/or interfering with the Tenant and the OCS Thika Police Station to assist with compliance.6.Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application and Reference, the Honourable Tribunal, on 20thSeptember, 2024, ordered the Landlord to reopen the suit premises and allow the Tenant free access to the premises and failure to open the Tenant to break and gain access with the assistance of the OCS Thika Police Station and the OCS Thika Police Station to assist with compliance.7.Due to non-appearance of the parties, on 5thApril, 2023, this Honourable Tribunal dismissed the suit herein. The Tenant filed a letter dated 9thMay, 2023 highlighting reasons for the non-appearance and consequently, the Tribunal reinstated the suit for hearing and determination on merits and fixed the matter for hearing on 13thJuly, 2023.8.On 13thJuly, 2023, the Honourable Tribunal dismissed the suit again due to non-appearance.9.The Tenant through an Application dated 26thApril, 2024 canvassed through a Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Tribunal be pleased to set aside and/or review its order issued on 13thJuly, 2023, the suit herein be reinstated and fixed for hearing and the Tenant be allowed to deposit the rent for the premises in the Tribunal.10.Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application dated 26thApril, 2024, the Tribunal, on 9thMay, 2024, directed the matter be fixed for hearing on 11thJune, 2024.11.In response to the Tenant’s Applications dated 19thSeptember, 2022 and 26thApril, 2024, the Landlord filed a Replying Affidavit and a Notice of Preliminary Objection both dated 5thJuly, 2024.12.The Honourable Tribunal, on 8thJuly, 2024, directed the parties to file Submissions. The Landlord filed her Submissions on 17thJuly, 2024 in support of the Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5thJuly, 2024 while the Landlords filed his Submissions on 24thJuly, 2024.13.It is therefore the Landlord’s Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5thJuly, 2024 that is the subject of this Ruling.C. Landlord’s Case14.The Landlord avers that there no longer exists a tenancy relationship between herself and the Tenant, as the Tenant vacated the suit premises on 1stJune, 2024 per the Notice to Terminate the tenancy dated 13thMarch, 2024. She contends that this Honourable Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to determine the subject of the Tenant’s Applications as there exists no tenancy relationship between her and the Tenant.D. Tenant’s Case15.The Tenant affirms that at the time reference was filed, he was Tenant of the suit premises. He avers that at all material times relevant to the Reference herein, there existed a Tenancy relationship between the parties herein.E. Jurisdiction16.The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Court has been contested by the Landlord vide a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5thJuly, 2024.17.It is the Landlord’s contention that currently there exists no tenancy relationship between the parties herein as the Tenant has since vacated the premises. The Notice of the Preliminary Objection is premised on Section 2(1) as read with Section 12 (1) (a) and 12 (4)Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act, Cap 301, Laws of Kenya.F. Issues For Determination18.Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties. It is therefore my respectful finding that the sole issue for determination is: Whether this Honourable Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject of the suit.G. Analysis And Findingsi.        Whether this Honourable Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject of the suit.19.This Honourable Tribunal has the duty to interrogate the question of jurisdiction and satisfy itself before making any further step in line with the celebrated case of Owners of the Motor Vessel ‘Lillian S’ Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited [1989] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held as follows:“I think that it is reasonably plain that a question of jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest opportunity and the court seized of the matter is then obliged to decide the issue right away on the material before it…”20.In the matter herein, it is the Landlord’s contention that the consequence of the Tenant vacating the premises was that it extinguished the tenancy relationship between the parties herein and subsequently, the jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal as provided under Section 2 of Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya. Additionally, the Landlord contends that the Notice of Preliminary Objection is founded on a question of jurisdiction as set out by the Court in Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd v West End Distributors (1969) EA 696, where the court stated that:“Consists of a point of law which has been pleaded or which arises by clear implication out of the pleadings…Examples are an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, or a plea of limitation…”21.In response, the Tenant notes that the Reference herein was filed during the pendency of the tenancy relationship between the parties herein. As such the Reference was properly filed and thus this Honourable Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine it.22.A Notice to vacate a premises does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal as such ouster can only take place once all pending matters before the Tribunal have been resolved. As such, it is crucial to assess the reference and the subsequent pleadings filed herein to establish pending issues in the matter herein.23.Upon assessment of the Reference and Pleadings filed herein, there are two issues for determination; whether the Tenant’s Application dated 19thSeptember, 2022 has been spent and whether there are any outstanding rent owed.24.I duly note that the prayers sought by the Tenant vide his Reference and Application dated 19thSeptember, 2022 have since been spent as the Tenant moved out of the suit premises. The prayers pleaded for have since been overtaken by events. The tenancy relationship between the parties was severed when the Tenant vacated the suit premises hence he cannot claim the rights accrued to Tenant as prayed in his Application.25.Similarly, the Landlord’s claim for outstanding rent arrears of Kshs. 115,050.00 as at June, 2024 has since been abandoned and/or dropped by the Landlord due to the Notice of Preliminary Objection filed.26.In light of the above, this Honourable Tribunal notes that all pending issues before the Tribunal have since been dispensed with.H. Orders27.In the upshot the following orders shall abide;a.The Landlord’s Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5thJuly, 2024 is hereby allowed;b.The Tenant’s Reference dated 19thSeptember, 2022 is hereby dismissed.c.No orders as to costs.HON A.

LR 209/590.4.The Firm of Bryan Khaemba, Kamau Kamau & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.B. Background Of The Dispute5.Through a Reference and an Application dated 4thApril, 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Landlord be compelled to reopen the suit premises, the Landlord be restrained from arbitrarily increasing the monthly rent, the Tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment to the suit premises be affirmed and the Landlord be restrained from evicting, harassing and/or interfering with the Tenant.6.Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application and Reference, the Honourable Tribunal, on 9thApril,2024, directed the matter be fixed for hearing on 16thApril, 2024.7.On 14thMay, 2024, the matter came up for mention where the Honourable Tribunal directed the Landlord to immediately reopen the suit premises in the interim pending hearing and determination of the Tenant’s Application.8.The Landlord, vide an Application dated 17thMay, 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, sought inter-alia the directions issued on 14thMay, 2024 be varied and/or set aside and an order for compensation be issued in favour of the Landlord in the sum of Kshs. 300,000.00 being unpaid rent, legal costs and loss of user of premises.9.Upon perusal of the Landlord’s Application, the Tribunal directed the same be heard on 25thJune, 2024. On 25thJune, 2024, the Tribunal directed the Landlord to respond to the Tenant’s Application dated 4thApril, 2024 within 7 days and subsequently, the Tenant to respond to the Landlord’s Application dated 17thMay, 2024 within 7 days.10.The Landlord, in response to the Tenant’s Application, filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by the Managing Director of the Landlord on 1stJuly, 2024.11.Subsequently, the Tenant, in response to the Landlord’s Application, filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on 3rdJuly, 2024 and a Further Affidavit dated 23rdJuly, 2024.12.It is therefore the Tenant’s Application dated 4thApril, 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 17thMay, 2024 that are the subject of this Ruling.C. Tenant’s Case13.The Tenant admitted to entering into a tenancy agreement with the Landlord on 10thFebruary, 2023.14.The Tenant vide his Further Affidavit sworn on 23rdJuly, 2024 avers that the Landlord had locked the suit premises between March, 2024 and 16thMay, 2024. He notes that this cause of action was due to the arbitrary increase of 20% of the monthly rent. In addition, the Tenant avers that at the time of forced closure he had no outstanding rent arrears. Contrarily, the Tenant, vide Further Affidavit admits to being in arrears of Kshs. 31,000.00 as at February, 2024 which he settled in March, 2024.15.The Tenant notes that the Landlord’s action is unfair and unjust and have caused him undue hardship and distress.D. Landlord’s Case16.The Landlord, vide the Managing Director’s sworn statement, affirmed that it had entered into a lease agreement over the suit premises with Tenant herein where it was agreed that the monthly rent would be equivalent to Kshs. 50,000.00. The Landlord averred that as at July 2023 the Tenant had fallen into arrears to the sum of Kshs. 155,000.00. He further noted that, in spirit of being accommodative, the Landlord entered into a payment plan dated 14thJuly, 2023 with the Tenant to settle the outstanding arrears.17.The Landlord swore that the Tenant was yet to settle his arrears which had increased to Kshs. 204,000.00 contrary to Tenant’s misrepresentation. Consequently, and as a result of the outstanding arrears, the Landlord avers that it was forced to issue a Termination Notice dated 12thMarch, 2024 and distress for rent arrears of Kshs. 94,000.00. The Landlord averred that it instructed Jogan Dries Auctioneers to effect the distress.18.The Landlord avers that Tenant has since vacated the premises and it was in the process of procuring another Tenant.19.The Landlord stated that due to the prevailing economic circumstances it had increased the rent by Kshs. 5,000.00. It noted that the same had been communicated to all the Tenants. Additionally, it stated that the Tenant’s claim that rent had been increased by 20% was false and a misrepresentation.20.The Landlord sought the Tenant’s Application dated 4thApril, 2024 to be dismissed.E. Jurisdiction21.The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.F. Issues For Determination22.Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by th  DIVISION - e parties. It is therefore my respectful finding that the issues for determination are:a.Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application dated 4thApril, 2024;b.Whether this Honourable Tribunal should set aside and/or vacate the Orders issued on 29thFebruary, 2024; andc.Whether the Landlord is entitled to an Order of Compensation of Kshs. 300,000.00 being unpaid rent, damages and loss of user of premises.G. Analysisa.          Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application dated 4thApril, 2024;23.Vide the Application dated 4thApril, 2024, the Tenant sought to restrain the Landlord from interfering with his right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the suit premises without unnecessary interference from the Landlord and that the Landlord be restrained from arbitrarily increasing the monthly rent.24.This Honourable Tribunal notes that the Tenant has since vacated the premises25.On alteration of terms of a controlled tenancy, the Landlord must satisfy two conditions, that is, the notice must be in writing and duration allowed must be at least two months. Section 4 (2) of the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter “Cap 301”) provides that:“(2)A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or to alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under, such a tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form”26.This Honourable Tribunal appreciates the Notice issued by the Landlord on 23rdFebruary, 2024 increasing the rent from Kshs. 50,000.00 to Kshs. 55,000.00. The Tribunal notes that the Landlord cited the prevailing economic situation and cost of living crisis as the reason for the rental increase.27.However, for an alteration of terms notice to be valid, the duration given for effect must be two months. Section 4 (4) of the Act provides that:“No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party”28.The abovementioned notice was due to take effect in the month of April, 2024. This Honourable Tribunal notes that the Landlord afforded the Tenant a one-month allowance. The time allowance provided is thus inadequate contrary to the provision of Section 4 (4) of Cap 301.29.Though the Landlord properly issued the notice, the duration allowed was short contrary to the provisions of Section 4 (4). Therefore, the notice issued was improper thus null and void.b.          Whether this Honourable Tribunal should set aside and/or vacate the Orders issued on 29thFebruary, 2024;30.Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows: -“1.(1)Any person considering himself aggrieved—          by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or          by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason (emphasis added), desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”31.The Court in the case of Republic v Public Procurement Administrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] e KLR held that: -“Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”32.The powers of the Business Premises Rent Tribunal are provided by the Cap 301 Section 12(1)(i) of the Act provides that:“A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power­-          ovary or rescind any order made by the Tribunal under the provisions of this Act;”33.A reading of Section 80 of theCivil Procedure ActCap 21, Section 12(1)(i) of the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya and Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provide for that the power to review orders can be exercised on application of a person and which Application could be based on the three grounds provided. The Courts have further espoused that where an application is grounded on sufficient reason it is for the court to exercise its discretion. On this matter I am guided by the Court decision in Tokesi Mambili and others vs Simion Litsanga {2004} eKLR where the court noted that:“….ii. Where the application is based on sufficient reason it is for the Court to exercise its discretion.”34.In light of the above, this Tribunal notes that the Application brought by the Landlord places reliance on the third ground for review provided under Order 45 Rule 1 of the CPR. It is the Landlord’s case that the Tenant misrepresented the facts of the case herein. The Landlord avers that the Tenant did not inform the Honourable Tribunal of his outstanding arrears of Kshs. 204,000.00 and exaggerated the fact that rent had only been increased by Kshs. 5,000.00 which is 10%.35.In his Application dated 4thApril, 2024, the Tenant averred that he did not have any outstanding rent. Additionally, he averred that the Landlord, without any just cause or legal basis locked him out of the premises and had unilaterally increased the rent by 20%. An assessment of the documentary evidence filed, this Honourable Tribunal notes that the Tenant had misrepresented the facts.36.For that reason and after careful consideration of the facts and pleadings presented to this Tribunal, I find that the Landlord has provided sufficient reason within the meaning of Section 80 of theCivil Procedure Act, Cap 21 and Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.d.            Whether the Landlord is entitled to an Order of Compensation of Kshs. 300,000.0037.It is trite law that a claim for special damages have to be claimed and strictly proved by evidence. On this I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Richard Okuku Oloo v South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd (2013) eKLR where the Court held that:“We agree with the learned judge that a claim for special damages must indeed be specifically pleaded and proved with a degree of certainty and particularity but we must add that, that degree and certainty must necessarily depend on the circumstances and the nature of the act complained of.”38.In the matter herein, the Landlord produced a copy of the statement of rent paid by the Tenant from 1stFebruary, 2023 to 1stMay, 2024. The Landlord’s claim for compensation is founded on the unpaid rent, general damages and the loss of a Tenant.39.This Honourable Tribunal is therefore mandated to establish the amount, if any, of the special damages the Landlord is entitled to be compensated. The Landlord claims Kshs. 300,000.00 as compensation for the losses suffered. Therefore, this Tribunal has to interrogate the extent of the breach of the tenancy to warrant compensation.40.On the issue of outstanding rent, the Landlord vide Annexure NSA-3 attached to the Application dated 17thMay, 2024, provided a copy of the Tenant’s rent statement as at 1stMay, 2024. The statement provides the rent paid and the outstanding balance. The balance provided is Kshs. 204,000.00. Though the outstanding balance has been disputed by the Tenant, he failed to produce any evidence challenging the same. The Statement filed by the Tenant as Annexure PAY-1, PAY-2 and PAY-3 failed to highlight any payment to the Landlord.41.This Honourable Tribunal, under issue 1, addressed itself on the issue of rent increment in which it invalidated the notice issued by the Landlord. Thus, the outstanding rent for the months of April, 2024 and May, 2024 is Kshs. 50,000.00 and not the Kshs. 55,000.00 claimed by the Landlord.42.In light of the above, the outstanding rent amount owed by the Tenant and proven by the Landlord is Kshs. 194,000.00.43.With the foregoing in mind, and after careful consideration of the pleadings and evidence filed thereof, I find that the Landlord is entitled to Kshs. 194,000.00 being the unpaid rent.44.The Tribunal finds no evidential basis for a claim of damages.H. Determination And Orders45.In the upshot, the following orders shall abide:a.The Tenant’s Application and Reference dated 4thApril, 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs at Kshs. 10,000.00;b.The Landlord’s Application dated 17thMay, 2024 is hereby partially upheld in terms of prayer 3;c.This Tribunal’s Interim Orders issued on 14thMay, 2024 are hereby set aside;d.The Rental Increase Notice dated 23rdFebruary, 2024 is hereby declared null and void;e.The Tenant shall pay the Landlord Kshs. 204,000.00 being outstanding rent of Kshs. 194,000.00 and legal costs assessed at Kshs. 10,000.00 of the suit herein made by the Tenant;f.The amount in (e) above to be paid by the Tenant within 60 days of the pronouncement of this Ruling; andg.Reference settled on similar terms.HON A.

The Claimant’s Case6.The claimant’s case is expressed in the memorandum of claim, oral and documentary evidence adduced through the claimant (CW1), and the written submissions by his counsel.7.In the memorandum of claim, the claimant pleads that at the material time he was an employee of the 2ndrespondent as a registered teacher based at 1strespondent’s high school. The claimant states that he was employed on 1stSeptember, 1994 and served in many high schools as a graduate teacher.8.It is pleaded that in a letter dated 20thAugust, 2013, the 2ndrespondent, through county director of education, Nakuru, transferred the claimant from St Joseph’s Elburgon Secondary School to Nakuru Boys’ High School with effect from 27thAugust, 2018.

A second letter of interdiction was issued, reiterating the previous allegations and allegedly adding new ones. The claimant responded to those allegations and provided what he considered to be the necessary supporting documents.11.It is pleaded that after responding to the above letter, the secretary to the 1strespondent purported to summon the claimant to attend a disciplinary hearing on 2ndDecember, 2019. He pleads that the letter inviting him to the hearing was not served upon the claimant but the same was served upon the 2ndrespondent. Subsequently, after issuing the second letter to attend the disciplinary hearing, which was not served the claimant, the 1strespondent proceeded to discuss the matter on 6thDecember, 2019 in the claimant’s absence resulting in a unanimous decision to have the claimant interdicted with immediate effect.12.The claimant states that pursuant to the said decision, the claimant’s case was forwarded to the 2ndrespondent for further action since the claimant was an employee of the 2ndrespondent. The matter was forwarded to the 2ndrespondent and the claimant was summoned for a disciplinary hearing vide a letter dated 21stMay, 2021. The hearing was scheduled for 24thJune, 2021. The claimant pleads that he attended the disciplinary hearing notwithstanding serious reservations about the process including lack of response to his request that he be supplied with various documents, inter-alia, communication on the disciplinary meeting of 6thDecember, 2019, to no avail.13.Subsequently, the 2ndrespondent dismissed the claimant vide a letter dated 1stJuly, 2021.14.On 3rdMarch, 2022, the claimant's dismissal was upheld after his request for a review/appeal was dismissed.

It is pleaded that despite several attempts to have the matter resolved in compliance with the laid down laws and regulations, and after giving notice of intention to sue, the respondents have continued to perpetuate the alleged illegality.17.In his testimony in court the claimant reiterated the foregoing pleadings and testified that he was an employee of the 2ndrespondent as from 1stSeptember, 1994.

However, on 27thOctober, 2020 he was served with an amended letter of interdiction that contained the same allegations as the previous two letters.20.He stated that he lodged a defence and refuted all the allegations and demanded to be supplied with the documents that the respondents had applied in interdicting him.

He stated that he was not invited to the 1strespondent’s meeting held on 6thDecember, 2019 as confirmed in the minutes presented in the court. He stated that the meeting was unprocedural as no witnesses were called and he did not get an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. He stated that the interdiction was based on the resolutions of the 1strespondent’s meeting held on 6thDecember, 2019. He stated that there was no written complaint filed against him in any of the schools where he taught.25.He further stated that during the interdiction he was supposed to be receiving half of his basic salary but it is only after the dismissal that the same was paid in arrears. He stated that no investigation report was filed with TSC and he was not served with any such report. Additionally, he stated that the disciplinary hearing panel was supposed to be chaired by a commissioner but this did not happen. He stated that the proceedings at the TSC were for all intents and purposes illegal and un-procedural.26.He added that he was not charged with any criminal offence(s). He produced his filed documents as exhibits 1 to 24.27.In cross-examination by counsel for the 1strespondent, the claimant stated that he was in Afraha High School until he was suspended on grounds of desertion. He confirmed that the 1strespondent’s meeting of 6thDecember, 2019 discussed his alleged misconduct and that he agreed to refund same money to one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1), who had complained against him vide a letter dated 23rdJanuary, 2019.

He stated that he is familiar with the code of conduct and regulations of the 2ndrespondent. He confirmed that he worked at Afraha High School whereat he had interacted with one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1). He acknowledged that he was aware of the allegations that he had received money from Mr. Muyanzi. He further stated that when he joined Nakuru High School in 2018 he received money from parents for purchase of text books without the knowledge or authorization from the 1strespondent.30.On cross-examination by counsel for the 2ndrespondent, the claimant stated that it is untrue that he was dismissed due to the complaints from the parents and alleged that he did not know the reasons for his removal. He stated that he did not know that there was a BOM meeting at the school on 6thDecember, 2019, and he only came to know about it on 23rdDecember, 2019 when he received the letter of interdiction.31.He admitted that according to Regulation 148 of the TSC regulations a teacher may be denied the half pay when on interdiction. He further admitted that that 2ndrespondent issued him with an amended letter of interdiction as provided for under Regulation 147 of the TSC Code of Regulations.32.He stated that he was not subjected to the disciplinary process in regard to the money that he received from parents and members of the public while teaching at Afraha High School. He stated that he was not charged in any criminal proceedings.33.In re-examination by his counsel, he stated that solicitation of money from one Merlin Zanzila was not one of the charges that he faced during the disciplinary hearing. He clarified that in 2018 he was not teaching at Afraha High School. He reiterated that he was not invited to the 1strespondent’s meeting held on 6thDecember, 2019 and that he only learnt about the said meeting upon interdiction on 23rdDecember, 2019. However, he admitted to soliciting and receiving money from one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1) and allegedly repaying it back while he was still a teacher at Afraha High School.34.It is on the basis on the foregoing evidence and circumstances that the claimant is seeking that judgment to be entered in his favour as prayed in the memorandum of claim. The submissions by his counsel shall be considered in a succeeding part of this judgment.III.

The claimant was accused of inciting staff, fraudulently obtaining money in guise of assisting desperate persons in securing employment with the 2ndrespondent, among other charges/allegations.61.It is on the basis on the foregoing evidence and circumstances that the respondents pray that the claimant’s cause be dismissed with costs. The submissions by the counsel for the 1stand 2ndrespondents shall be considered in the succeeding parts of this judgment alongside those by counsel for the claimant.IV. Submissions By Counsel For The Claimant62.The claimant’s counsel identified the following three issues for determination - Whether the interdiction of the claimant by the 1strespondent was lawful and procedural; Whether the claimant’s subsequent dismissal by the 2ndrespondent was lawful and procedural; and, Whether the claimant should be granted the orders sought.63.On the first issue, it is submitted that for a dismissal or termination to be fair and lawful it should pass the substantive and procedural fairness test. Counsel cited Section 41 ofEmployment Act(the Act) as well as the Regulations for Teachers 2015 (the Regulations) promulgated under the Teachers Code of Conduct and Ethics for Teachers (the Code). It is submitted that any complaint against a teacher shall be in writing in accordance with Regulation 145(1).64.It is submitted that the interdiction of the claimant followed a meeting held by the 1strespondent on 6thDecember, 2019 in the absence of the claimant as he had neither been served with the charges/allegations nor invited to the meeting. It is submitted that no formal complaint had been made against the claimant as required in the legal provisions cited above. Yet, it is further submitted, the respondents allege that there were charges of the claimant inciting staff in a meeting held on 12thApril, 2019, allegations of solicitation of money while the claimant was a teacher at Afraha High School in 2018, and for failing to repay a loan of Kshs20,000/= that was advanced to him by the school, and soliciting for money from students and members of the public.65.It is submitted that the allegations/charges against the claimant when he served at Afraha High School were not the subject of the disciplinary process and no complaints had been made against the claimant in writing. It is submitted that the respondents veered off the procedure when they considered extraneous matters for which no charges had been filed and for which the claimant had not been called to defend himself. In any event, it is submitted, the BOM Afraha High School is not a party in this cause.66.It is submitted that the respondents, and more so the 1strespondent, failed to carry out proper investigation of the allegations and that is why no report was served upon the claimant and none was filed or availed in court during the trial of this cause. It is submitted that this casual approach by the respondents violated Regulations 144, 145, & 146(6) as well as the rules of natural justice.67.Counsel cited Mary Chemweno Kiptui V Kenya Pipeline Company LTD (2014) eKLR, Walter Anuro Ogaro V Teachers Service Commission (2013) eKLR, and Joseph Mwaniki Ng’ang’a V United Millers (2022) eKLR amongst other decisions in his assertion that the entire process as undertaken by the respondents was unfair and unlawful.68.On the second issue, it is submitted that having failed to comply with the provisions cited in the foregoing paragraphs the resultant dismissal of the claimant was wrongful, unfair, and illegal. It is submitted that the reason(s) for the interdiction and the procedure adopted were defective and as such the dismissal was unlawful. In that regard counsel cited Godfrey Khalitiba Lukorito V Teachers Service Commission (2019) eKLR.69.It is submitted that the dismissal was a nullity, ab initio, for lack of substance and the procedure was equally defective and unlawful. The court is reminded that the claimant was not charged with any crime notwithstanding all the unsubstantiated claims against him and no reports were made to the police yet Regulation 139(5) mandates the 2ndrespondent to work with law enforcement agencies where criminal conduct is alleged. Counsel has cited James Peterson Njeru V Teachers Service Commission (2017) eKLR in driving that point home.70.On reliefs, it is submitted that having been denied both substantive and procedural fairness the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the memo of claim. Again, counsel has urged the court to be persuaded by the reasoning in Godfrey Khalitaba Lukorito V Teachers Service Commission (Supra).V. Submissions By Counsel For The 1st Respondent71.The counsel for the 1strespondent identified the following three issues for determination - Whether the claimant’s interdiction and subsequent disciplinary hearing was lawful; Whether the claimant should be granted the reliefs sought; and, whether the claim offends the provisions of section 107 of theEvidence Acton the burden of proof.72.On the first issue, it is submitted that the claimant was interdicted on various counts of gross misconduct. The charges/allegations included inciting members of staff in a staff meeting, collecting money from unsuspecting parents and members of the public in guise that he could secure employment for them with the 2ndrespondent, failure to repay money advanced to him by the school, and failure to execute his duties diligently and in accordance with the Code and Regulations. It is submitted that the respondents complied with the law in conducting the entire process culminating in the dismissal of the claimant.73.It is submitted that under Section 20 of theTeachers Service Commission Actthe 2ndrespondent may generally or in particular delegate its mandate or part thereof to a committee, member, officer, staff, or agent in exercise of any of its functions and duties under the said law. It is submitted that it is on the basis and strength of the above law that the 1strespondent carried the investigations, conducted the disciplinary hearing, and issued an interdiction letter to the claimant in accordance with Regulations 146(2)(a) & 147(1). It is submitted that the claimant was informed of the disciplinary meeting held on 6thDecember, 2019 but he deliberately failed to attend the hearing. Counsel cited Jennifer Osodo V Teachers Service Commission (2013) eKLR in advancing the argument that a teacher should not hold the 1strespondent at ramson by insisting that disciplinary proceedings be conducted at the convenience an employee.74.It is submitted that in any event the interdiction was only a preliminary step in the entire disciplinary process and the claimant was afforded full and fair hearing in accordance with the Code and Regulations. Counsel cited Judicial Service Commission V Gladys Boss Shollei & Another in emphasizing that when considered in its entirety the disciplinary process against the claimant was fair, just, and lawful as the claimant was given a fair hearing in accordance with the law, the Code, and the Regulations.75.On the second issue, it is submitted that the claimant is not entitled to the reliefs sought as the dismissal was fair and lawful. It is submitted that in National Bank of Kenya V Samuel Nguru Mutonya (2019) eKLR the Court of Appeal held that the reliefs provided for under Section 49 of the Act are discretionary not mandatory.76.On the third issue, it is submitted that the claimant failed to prove his claim hence offending Sections 107 & 112 of theEvidence Act. In that regard the court is urged to follow the reasoning in Leonard Otieno V Airtel Kenya Limited (2018) eKLR & David Githinji Kibuge V New Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd (2019) eKLR.77.The court is urged to dismiss the claim with costs for all the reasons alluded to above.VI. Submissions By Counsel For The 2Nd Respondent78.The 2ndrespondent’s counsel identified the following three issues for determination- Whether the claimant was dismissed on reasonable grounds; Whether the due process for dismissal was followed; and, Whether the claimant is entitled to the prayers sought.79.On the first issue, it is submitted that the claimant was fairly and lawfully dismissed for infamous conduct after due process. It is submitted that the respondents had good and reasonable grounds in taking the disciplinary action all the way to the dismissal. It is submitted that based on the information and the allegations made against the claimant the respondents took the right action under Section 43 of the Act based on genuine believe and reasonable grounds of the alleged misconduct. It is submitted that based on Section 33 of theTeachers Service Commission Act& Regulation 146 of the Code the 2ndrespondent investigated the allegations against the claimant as provided by the 1strespondent from the latter’s meeting of 6thDecember, 2019, and found substance to escalate the matter to hearing.80.It is submitted that the 2ndrespondent, the employer, genuinely believed the allegations against the claimant, including the fact that the claimant had admitted refunding money to RW1 which money he had obtained with false pretences and or fraudulently. It is submitted that the above victim testified in this trial and indeed confirmed that the claimant had obtained a sum of Kshs30,000/= in the guise that he could secure employment with the 2ndrespondent for the victim’s son. The evidence on record is that the claimant subsequently refunded the money.81.It is submitted that the claimant admitted in the trial that he borrowed a sum of Kshs20,000/= from the 1strespondent which he failed, refused, and or neglected to repay. He also admitted receiving money from parents to allegedly purchase text books for the leaners outside the established official structure of school fees. It is submitted that based on the evidence availed the respondents took the appropriate action culminating in the fair and lawful dismissal of the claimant.82.Further, it is submitted that the claimant failed to prove that the dismissal was unfair and unlawful under Section 47(5) of the Act. Counsel cited Reuben Ikatwa & 17 Others V Commanding Officer British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) (unreported) & Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited (2017) eKLR among other decisions on this point.83.It is submitted that on a balance of probabilities the claimant failed to prove his cause while the respondents demonstrated that there were good and sound grounds for taking the disciplinary action based on genuine believe and indeed proved gross misconduct and infamous conduct on the part of the claimant.84.On due process, it is submitted that the respondents complied with Part XI of the Code, the Act, and Rules of natural justice. It is submitted that the claimant was issued with a show-cause letter spelling out the specific charges/allegations against him and he was given an opportunity to defend himself.85.It is submitted that while the original allegations related to the misconduct of the claimant while serving at Nakuru Boys’ High School, to wit incitement of staff, soliciting for funds from parents, and failing to repay the money advanced to him, it was subsequently discovered that the claimant had other serious and gross misconduct while serving at Afraha High School relating to fraudulently obtaining money in the guise of securing jobs with the 2ndrespondent for desperate job-seekers. It is submitted that the case of RW1 alluded to above is a clear case of gross misconduct and the claimant admitted to the same.86.It is submitted that the evidence on record proves that the claimant was issued with a show-cause letter, investigation was carried out, interdiction served, defence to the allegations filed, invitation to the hearing served, disciplinary hearing held, and a lawful decision arrived at based on the evidence adduced. The decision of dismissal was promptly communicated to the claimant. The court is urged to find that the respondents subjected the claimant to due process and as such to uphold the decision reached. It is submitted that upon filing his appeal /review dated 17thSeptember, 2022 the claimant was invited to argue and he indeed argued his appeal at length on 24thFebruary, 2022. The appeal was considered on merit but the dismissal was upheld.87.It is submitted that considering the entire circumstances in this cause the claimant was afforded both substantive and procedural fairness and the court is urged to uphold the dismissal. Counsel cited Judicial Service Commission V Gladys Boss Shollei & Another (Supra) to the effect that due process need not be so elaborate as demanded of a trial in court and that as long as the basic rules and tenets of natural justice are complied with the process should be deemed adequate and satisfactory.88.On reliefs, the court is urged to find that since the dismissal was fair and lawful the claimant is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought. It is submitted that in view of his demonstrated infamous conduct and gross misconduct the 2ndrespondent lost trust and confidence in the claimant and it is inconceivable that the claimant is seeking reinstatement yet he was the author of his own misfortune. It is submitted that the claimant is not a good example to the learners in view of his corrupt and unprofessional conduct.89.Further, it is submitted that since the dismissal was fair and lawful the issue of compensation does not arise. In any event, it is submitted, the claimant failed to prove that he was entitled to such compensation including gratuity which was in any event not provided for in his contract of service. As if a reminder was needed, the court is urged not to be driven by sympathy but by justice and consider the interests of both parties in the entire circumstances of this cause.VII. Issues For Determination90.The court has carefully and dutifully gone through the pleadings filed, the oral and documentary evidence presented from all the parties, and the written submissions by counsel for all the parties. In the considered view of the court the following issues commend themselves for determination: -a.Was the dismissal of the claimant wrongful, unfair, and unlawful?b.If (a) above is in the affirmative, is the claimant entitled to the reliefs sought? And,c.Costs?VIII. Substantive Justification And Procedural Fairness91.The jurisprudence on what constitutes unfair and unlawful termination and wrongful dismissal is somehow now settled. Besides the employer establishing a good reason for the termination or dismissal (substantive fairness) it has to be established that the employee was afforded and granted a hearing to defend himself against any allegations or charges levelled against him/her (procedural fairness). The substantive and the procedural fairness are what is collectively referred to as due process – See Mary Chemweno V Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (2017) eKLR, Loice Otieno V Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (2013) eKLR, and Walter Ogal Anuro V Teachers Service Commission (2012) eKLR.92.Without the necessity of repeating the analysis of the evidence availed, which has been so well analysed by counsel for the parties in their respective written submissions as summarized above, the court shall weigh the facts, evidence, and circumstances of this cause against the test stated above – substantive and procedural fairness – in determining whether the dismissal was unfair and unlawful as pleaded and prayed by the claimant.93.Vide a letter dated 1stSeptember, 1994 the 2ndrespondent engaged the claimant as a graduate teacher on the terms and conditions set out therein and his appointment was confirmed on 7thOctober, 1996. The claimant thereafter served in several schools including Afraha High School, St. Joseph’s Elburgon, and Nakuru Boys’ High School, the latter being his last station before dismissal vide a letter dated 1stJuly, 2021.94.The claimant joined Nakuru Boys’ High School on 27thAugust, 2018 as confirmed in a letter dated 7thSeptember, 2018 as per the letters that he exhibited in court.95.In a meeting held by the 1strespondent on 6thDecember, 2019, whose minutes were exhibited in the trial by the claimant, the conduct of the claimant was discussed. It was alleged that he had failed to refund or repay a sum of Kshs20,000/= that he had borrowed from the school; and, that RW1 had written to the principal of the school to the effect that the claimant had conned or fraudulently obtained from him a sum of Kshs30,000/= when the claimant was a teacher at Afraha High School in the guise that he would secure a job with the 2ndrespondent for the son of the victim. It is stated in the said minutes that the claimant had admitted to the misconduct and undertaken to refund the money. A similar complaint had been made by one Kogo Kipng’etich Noah. Further, it was alleged that the claimant had on several occasions incited members of staff against the administration and one such incident was cited to have occurred during a staff meeting held on 12thApril, 2019. It was also alleged that the claimant had been asking for and receiving money from parents to allegedly purchase books for learners without the knowledge and or approval by the school administration. It was also alleged that he had received money from parents in the promise of securing admission of their children to the school.96.The letters of complaint by the persons named above were exhibited and produced as exhibits by the 2ndrespondent. In my considered view those letters constituted the written complaints against the claimant.97.It was alleged that the claimant had been informed of the foregoing allegations and charges but no evidence was availed to prove that indeed the claimant had been informed of the charges and or invited to the meeting held on 6thDecember, 2019. The letter dated 13thNovember, 2019 inviting the claimant to the meeting and informing him of the charges bears no evidence that the claimant was served with the same.98.However, the court notes that the claimant filed the said letter as an exhibit in his bundle of documents and no explanation was offered as to how he obtained the same if the same had not been served upon him.99.Subsequent to the above meeting, the claimant was served with two undated letters of interdiction. In his evidence, the claimant admitted that he was served with the said letters on or about 23rdDecember, 2019. The interdiction took effect from 6thDecember, 2019. The claimant was accused of insubordination, incitement of staff, solicitation of funds, obtaining funds from parents, as stated in the minutes alluded to above, and he was invited to respond thereto in writing.100.The court has seen the response/defence by the claimant dated 25thDecember, 2019 in which he denied the charges and allegations levelled against him.101.As required by the Code and the Regulations, the 1strespondent escalated the matter to the 2ndrespondent and in a letter dated 28thSeptember, 2020 the claimant was interdicted by his employer in line with Regulation 146. The letter reiterated the charges and enumerated them as per the minutes of the meeting of 6thDecember, 2019, and the letter of interdiction earlier on issued by the 1strespondent. The claimant was invited to respond to the charges/allegations in writing and avail any evidence or defence that he had. As noted above, the claimant filed his amended response in the letter dated 25thDecember, 2019 following the initial interdiction by the 1strespondent.102.The court finds and holds that even if the claimant was not invited to the meeting of 6thDecember, 2019, by the 1strespondent, which is however in doubt as he readily filed in court the letter inviting him, such defect in the process was cured and rectified when he was served afresh by the 2ndrespondent and invited to defend himself and to attend the disciplinary hearing.103.In a letter dated 21stMay, 2021 the claimant was invited for a virtual hearing of his disciplinary case on 24thJune, 2021 which hearing was to take place in the 2ndrespondent’s county director’s office at Nakuru. For ease of reference the said letter provided as follows –Ref: No. TSC/351854 21/5/2021TSC/DISC/NO. 0503/01/2019/2020/35Mr/Mrs/Miss Peter Njoroge Ng’ang’aRe: Invitation For Hearing Of Discipline CaseFurther to the interdiction letter dated 6thDecember, 2019, I am directed to inform you that, your case will be heard virtually on 24thJune, 2021 at TSC County Director’s office – Nakuru at 8.30 a.m. or soon thereafter. You are invited to attend in person together with your witnesses (if any).Please bring the falling documents which the Commission may wish to examine during the hearing:a.Original copies of your academic and professional certificates;b.Last payslip;c.National Identification Card;d.Certificate of Registration as a teacher;You are also advised to bring your letter of interdiction together with any documents that may be useful in your defence.You are advised to contact the Teachers Service Commission if communication of the decision of the case is not communicated to you within 28 days from the date of the hearing.David MukuiFor: Secretary/chief ExecutiveTeachers Service Commission104.The proceedings of the disciplinary hearing were exhibited and produced by the 1strespondent capturing the entire hearing. Ultimately, a decision was made that the claimant be dismissed from service of the 2ndrespondent. The decision was communicated to the claimant in a letter dated 1stJuly, 2021.105.Dissatisfied with the decision to dismiss him, the claimant appealed vide a letter dated 17thSeptember, 2019. The appeal/review was considered on 3rdMarch, 2022 and the minutes indicate that the claimant attended the hearing and he argued his case extensively.106.However, the dismissal was upheld and the claimant was accordingly informed vide a letter dated 9thMarch, 2022.107.Of course, it is in the backdrop of the above background that the claimant filed this cause in court on 4thOctober, 2022 seeking for the reliefs alluded to in the introductory part of this judgment. For avoidance of doubt, the time of three years within which the claimant was to file his claim in court started running on the date when the appeal process concluded and the claimant informed of the outcome on 9thMarch, 2022.108.It is the finding and holding of this court that the employer, the 2ndrespondent, had genuine and reasonable grounds upon which to found disciplinary action against the claimant. Section 43(2) of the Act sets out a subjective test upon which an employer decides on whether to take disciplinary action against an employee. So long as the employer genuinely and reasonably believed that the alleged and disclosed misconduct or that the circumstances thereof disclosed misconduct, the employer had good and sound grounds to act.109.This court (ELRC) has to warn itself not to trespass into the arena of human resources management at the workplace as that should be the province and within the purview of an employer. Unless there is established illegalities or irregularities, the court should not and shall not intervene or interfere with and in the human resources management at the workplace.200.The claimant was accused of gross misconduct and or infamous conduct as set out in the show-cause letter. The details thereof were supplied right from the level where the matter was handled by 1strespondent to the level when the matter was escalated to the 2ndrespondent. The charges, in my view, as enumerated elsewhere in this judgment, were gross and grave.201.The allegation and claim by the claimant that he was charged with misconduct that did not occur while serving at Nakuru Boys’ High School but at Afraha High School is, to say the least, escapist and naïve. At all material times the claimant was an employee of the 2ndrespondent regardless of the school wherein he was teaching. In any event, the claimant’s proved misconduct while at Afraha High School followed him to Nakuru Boys’ High School. Suffice to say that all the charges against the claimant at whatever locus committed were laid out to him and he was called upon to defend himself.202.In my considered view, on the basis of the charges/allegations against the claimant, the respondents acted fairly and lawfully in pursuing disciplinary action against him in the genuine belief that the claimant had violated the law, the Regulations, and the Code. In terms of substance, in my considered view, the respondents complied with the law and more so Sections 43 & 45 of the Act.203.The claimant in his evidence admitted receiving and failing to repay the sum of Kshs20,000/= to the 1strespondent, he also admitted in cross-examination that he had received money from RW1 as charged and that he had refunded the same. He also admitted asking for money from parents to allegedly buy textbooks for learners outside the established school fees structure and without the knowledge and or approval from the 1strespondent. It does not matter that the claimant was not charged in a criminal court. Besides the provisions in the Regulations and the Code as cited by counsel for the respondents the claimant also violated Section 44(4)(g) of the Act.204.In terms of the procedure adopted, the court finds and holds that the claimant was informed of the charges and the particulars thereof, he was served with a show-cause letter and given a chance to respond thereto in writing, and he was invited for a hearing and informed of his right to bring his evidence and even call witnesses. He attended the hearing in person and as per the minutes was heard and afforded due process. The decision to dismiss him was promptly communicated to him and he was informed of his right of appeal/review which he exercised. Upon rejection of his appeal and upholding of the dismissal, the claimant was promptly informed of that outcome.205.With all due respect to the claimant and his counsel, the court finds and holds that the claimant was heard and due process accorded to him. The court finds no reason to fault the substantive and procedural steps as undertaken and executed by the respondents.206.For all the above reasons, the court upholds the dismissal and hereby declares and proclaims so. The court takes this position based on the facts and evidence adduced and presented in court in full cognizance of the fact that the claimant is a person living with a disability having appeared in the physical court to give his testimony and also tendering documentary evidence of his disability. There is no evidence of discrimination whatsoever as the claimant alleged in his evidence in court.207.The claimant is the author of his own misfortune for the path of self-destruction that he chose. He confirmed that he is well informed in the regulations and ethical dictates of his profession. As much as the court may be empathetic of the claimant and his condition, the facts and evidence in this court portrays the claimant as a person on a mission of self-destruction. I hope he learns from the experience of this matter and picks himself up towards a better future.208.For all the foregoing reasons, the claimant’s cause is hereby dismissed.IX. Orders209.The claimant’s cause is hereby dismissed in its entirety with no order as to costs.DELIVERED VIRTUALLY, DATED, AND SIGNED AT NAKURU THIS 4THDAY OF JULY, 2024.…………………….DAVID NDERITUJUDGE",Ng’ang’a v Board of Management Nakuru Boys High School & another (Cause E017 of 2022) [2024] KEELRC 2175 (KLR) (4 July 2024) (Judgment),Cause E017 of 2022,"DN Nderitu, J","July 4, 2024",

      [2024] KEELRC 2174 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the Employment and Labour Relations Court at NakuruAppeal E020 of 2023DN Nderitu, JJuly 4, 2024BetweenFred ChepkwonyAppellantandProtective Custody LimitedRespondent(Being an appeal from the ruling and order of the Senior Resident Magistrate (Hon E. S. Soita) delivered on 27th June, 2023, in Nakuru CMCC (ELRC) No. E229 of 2021)JudgmentI. Introduction1.The appellant herein (the claimant in the lower court) commenced Nakuru CMCC (ELRC) No. E229 of 2021 by way of a plaint dated 21stDecember, 2022 filed through Maragia Ogaro & Co. Advocates, claiming the following –a.Notice Payb.Overtimec.Underpaymentd.Off dutiese.Public Holidaysf.Leaveg.Compensationh.Certificate of service2.The memorandum of claim was accompanied with a verifying affidavit and a list of one witness, the claimant. No list or bundle of documents was filed.3.The claimant pleaded that he was engaged by the respondent as a day-guard in June, 2018 but he was allegedly unfairly and unlawfully terminated on 12thJuly, 2020. He did not plead or mention that there existed a written contract of employment or a letter of appointment between himself and the respondent.4.Once served with the summons, the respondent entered appearance on 31stJanuary, 2023. On 8thFebruary, 2023 the respondent filed a chamber summons dated 2ndFebruary, 2023 seeking the following orders –1.The cause filed herein be stayed and the dispute be referred to Arbitration in accordance with the Agreement of the parties as set out in the Appointment Letter dated 1stJanuary 2022.2.The costs of this application be borne by the claimant.5.Annexed to the supporting affidavit to the application is a purported letter of appointment allegedly executed between the parties herein which is alleged to be the contract of employment between the claimant and the respondent. The letter was allegedly executed by the parties on 1stJanuary, 2022.6.The contention by the respondent is that clause 7 of the said letter of appointment/contract provided that any dispute(s) relating to the employment relationship created between the parties is to be referred to arbitration for adjudication.7.In his replying affidavit to the application the appellant disowned the said letter of appointment/contract and vehemently denied ever executing the same. He refers to the document as a forgery and fraudulent.8.It is important to note that to this day the respondent has not filed a response/defence to the claim. This fact has a significant effect on the proceedings as shall be noted hereunder.9.In a ruling delivered on and dated 27thJune, 2023, the trial lower court issued the following orders –a.The court has no jurisdiction in this claim.b.The claim in struck out with no orders as to cost.10.This appeal is against the above ruling and orders and the appellant has raised the following grounds in the memorandum of appeal dated 24thFebruary, 2023 –1.That the learned trial magistrate court erred in law and in fact in granting the prayers that were not sought by the Respondent in the respondent’s application dated 2.2.2023.2.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note and take cognizance of the fact that the Appellant had denounced in whole the purported Appointment Letter that the Respondent had alleged that it was signed by the Appellant.3.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to address valid questions and issues that were raised in the said Appointment Letter.4.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the respondent who had propagated the question of “Reference to Arbitration” failed to refer the matter to Arbitration and or initiate the said process but opted to wait for the claimant to lodge the dispute in court for it to raise the issue of Arbitration. This casted doubt and faith to the authenticity of the purported Appointment Letter.5.That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the Employment and Labour Court under Article 162(2)(a) ofthe Constitutionis clothed with original and exclusive jurisdiction as read with the provision of Section 87 of theEmployment Act.6.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the Arbitration does not have the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine a dispute and especially the reliefs that were sought the Appellant given that the said reliefs are anchored under the numerous Section of theEmployment Act,Labour Institutions Actand the Wages Order which clothes and guides the Employment and Labour Court with clear tabulation mechanisms.7.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the submission filed on behalf of the Appellant then claimant.8.That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the subject clause (that is Clause 7 of the purported Appointment Letter) failed to meet the authentic test in that it only compelled the Employee to subject himself or herself to the whims of the Employers Board and if not, be subjected to the Arbitration Process for which the Employee has no easy access as is the Employment and Labour Relations Court.9.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the subject Clause had excluded the Appellant or any employee the initial access to the Employees Union or Representative, thus the said Clause cannot override the powers of the Employment and Labour Relations Court to hear and determine disputes emanating from unlawful termination.10.That the learned magistrate erred in law and in delivering a Ruling that was and will remain oppressive, wanting in law and logic, tilting to one side of the divide and biased in fairness.11.On 15thNovember, 2023 the court directed that the appeal be canvassed by way of written submissions. Mr. Maragia for the appellant filed his written submissions on 14thNovember, 2023, while Miss Kinoti for the respondent filed on 29thNovember, 2023. With the leave of the court, Mr. Maragia for the appellant filed supplementary submissions on 13thDecember, 2023.II. Submissions By Counsel12.On the one hand, counsel for the appellant identified the following issues for determination –i.Whether the court acted erroneously in holding that the claimant had agreed and or had submitted himself to the Arbitration by reference to the clause in the Appointment Letter that the claimant questioned.ii.Whether from the content of purported Appointment Letter, the claimant had no option but have the matter referred to Arbitration even on sight of the falsities pointed out by the claimant and steps taken by respondent.iii.Whether the claimant contested the purported Letter of Appointment and if the court ignored the said contestation raised by the claimantiv.Whether the court lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause arising from termination in terms of Section 87 of the Employment vis-a-vis Article 162(2)(a) ofConstitution of Kenya, 2010on the one hand and the provision of the Appointment Letter vis-à-vis the provision of Section 4 of theArbitration Act.13.On the first issue, it is submitted that the lower court ignored the fact that the appellant contested, opposed, and denied the purported letter of appointment/contract and that the appellant denied signing and or thumbprinting the same. It is submitted that the lower court misdirected itself and went against the evidence on record when it ruled and held that the appellant had not denied executing and or thumbprinting the said document. It is submitted that the appellant was extremely categorical in his replying affidavit that he neither signed nor thumb-printed on the alleged document and as such his position is that the same is a forgery intended to mislead the court and that the lower court fell into the trap.14.In the foregoing circumstances, counsel submits, there was no agreement and or consent between the parties that any dispute in regard to their employment relationship was to be arbitrated.15.Further, it is submitted that the appellant, as per his claim, was engaged by the respondent in June, 2018 and terminated in July, 2020. Yet, the contract is alleged to have been executed in January, 2022, long after the appellant had been terminated. It is submitted that the above facts and evidence abundantly demonstrate that the alleged letter of appointment/contract is a forgery and fraudulent and the trial lower court gravely erred in its ruling by holding otherwise.16.It is submitted that the subject matter of the claim is an employment dispute that properly lies within the jurisdiction of a court with jurisdiction over such matters and the trial lower court was properly seized of the matter but misdirected itself in holding and denying its jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. Counsel has cited Section 87 of theEmployment Act(the Act) in support of the jurisdiction of the court.17.It is submitted that the parties in their relationship did not invoke or subject themselves to theArbitration Actas no such jurisdiction was expressly or otherwise implied in the terms and conditions of service.18.On the other hand, counsel for the respondent identified two issues for determination – Whether there is a valid arbitration clause; and, Whether the trial court has jurisdiction over the subject matter.19.On the first issue, counsel relied on the disputed letter of appointment/contract submitting that going by the same the parties agreed and consented to arbitration in case of a dispute. Counsel has submitted extensively on the extent to which arbitration clauses in contracts bind parties and cited several authorities on the same. For reasons that shall become clear in a moment, the court shall not engage in analyzing the submission by counsel from that angle.20.On the second issue, counsel submitted along the same line of thought that once the parties consented to the arbitration clause in the alleged but disputed contract the jurisdiction of the court was ousted. Again, the court shall desist in interrogating the issue at this point but deal with the same in the succeeding parts of the determination.21.The court is urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.22.In the supplementary submissions, counsel for the appellant reiterated the position taken in the initial submissions. It is submitted that since the letter of appointment/contract is disputed the trial court made a grave error in relying on the same and arriving at the decision that it did - striking out the appellant’s case in the most draconian and unfair manner.23.The court is urged to allow the appeal with costs.III. Issues For Determination24.The court has carefully gone through the memorandum of appeal and the written submissions by counsel for both parties. In my comprehensive understanding of the issues raised in the memorandum of appeal and upon reading the ruling/order that gave rise to the appeal, the learned trial magistrate struck out the suit on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter.25.It is important to note and state that striking out of the suit is not one of the prayers that the respondent had sought in the application. What was sought in the application was for stay of the proceedings pending referral to and determination of the matter on arbitration.26.The following issues commend themselves for determination –a.Is there a proved and accepted letter of appointment/contract of employment between the parties wherein arbitration was agreed as the method of resolving any dispute(s) arising therefrom hence ousting the jurisdiction of the court?b.Depending on the outcome of issue (a) above, what are the appropriate orders for this court to make?c.Costs.27.The answer to issue (a) above is fairly straightforward. As noted elsewhere in this judgment, the appellant did not plead or allude to a letter of appointment or a written contract between him and the respondent. It is the respondent who introduced an alleged letter of appointment and only did so by way of an application. To this point, and the record confirms this, the respondent has not filed a defence or a response to the claim. Had a response or a defence been filed, the appellant should have had an opportunity to respond thereto.28.Be that as it may, the impugned letter of appointment is vehemently denied and opposed by the appellant. The court notes that the page allegedly executed by the parties is separate from the other part of the document. The first page is not signed or initialed by the parties. Contrary to what the counsel for the respondent alleges, it is the respondent who introduced the document into the proceedings and hence bore the burden of proving that indeed the same is genuine, more so, when the appellant disputed the same.29.Under Sections 10 and 74 of theEmployment Actit is the duty and obligation of the employer, the respondent, to keep records of employment and as such it is the employer who bears the burden of proving their authenticity. The court finds and holds that under Section 107 of theEvidence Actthe burden of proof into the authenticity and genuineness of the said document lies with the respondent.30.However, the required proof may only be achieved in a trial where the document is introduced as an exhibit and challenged for the court to determine its authenticity, genuineness, and admissibility in evidence. As it stands now, there is no evidence that the appellant executed the same as alleged by the respondent through an application. As far as I understand the appellant’s case in the lower court, his position is that there was no written contract or letter of appointment issued to him.31.Further, the appellant states that the letter of appointment reads that it was executed in January, 2022, long after he had been terminated. This is one of the reasons that the appellant termed the document a forgery and hence fraudulent.32.In my considered view, it was wrong, erroneous, and misleading for the lower court to rely on a contested document, which in any event had not been produced as an exhibit, to make such final and draconian orders against the appellant. Striking out a cause or suit is so draconian and should only be applied in the most obvious and clear circumstances.33.The respondent did not file and has not filed a defence or response to the claim; the contested document has not even been listed as one of those that the respondent shall be relying on during the trial; the appellant has not had the opportunity of responding to the expected defence; the impugned document is contested and the same has not been produced and admitted in evidence as an exhibit.34.In the foregoing circumstances, it was misleading, premature, prejudicial, erroneous, and wrong for the trial lower court to have relied on the said document to strike out the cause. The court denied the appellant a right to be heard as envisaged under Articles 47 & 50 ofthe Constitution.35.The multitude of cases cited by counsel is irrelevant at this stage. The appellant contested the impugned document and termed it a forgery and fraudulent. The trial court ought to have proceeded with the trial and allowed the parties to contest the document in the trial. The lower court wrongfully and unlawfully shifted the burden to the appellant to disapprove the authenticity and genuineness of a document that had not been, in the first place, produced as an exhibit.36.Further, the order of striking out the suit was not one of those sought by the respondent. The prayer sought was for stay of proceedings pending the arbitration process. Again, the trial court was too enthusiastic in striking out the cause which I find hasty and prejudicial to the appellant. Even if the lower court were to find, in a trial properly conducted, that the contested document was genuine, it ought to stay the proceedings and the parties directed to commence the arbitration.37.In answer to issue one, therefore, the court returns that so far there is no evidence of a binding letter of appointment/contract that demands that the parties refer the subject matter for arbitration. This is so because there is no such document on record properly produced in the trial. Further, the document that has been alluded to by the respondent in the application has been contested and denied by the appellant. The contest over the document may only be settled in a properly conducted trial.38.For all the foregoing reasons, therefore, the appeal is allowed and the court orders that the suit in the lower court be and is hereby reinstated to be heard by a magistrate, other than Hon. E. Soita, to its logical conclusion.39.The appellant is awarded the costs of the appeal.IV. Orders40.In allowing the appeal, the court issues the following orders -a.The order of the lower trial court striking out the suit for purported want of jurisdiction be is hereby set aside and the suit is reinstated for hearing on merits to logical conclusion.b.The suit shall now be heard on merits by any other magistrate, other than Hon. Mr. E.

      [2024] KEHC 10555 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at KakamegaCriminal Appeal 003 of 2021SC Chirchir, JAugust 26, 2024BetweenJohn Juma MatsanzaAppellantandRepublicRespondentJudgment1.The Appellant was charged in the Chief Magistrate’s court at Kakamega , with 7 others, of a number of offences under the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003. The Appellant herein was charged with three counts.2.On count 1 , he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the law relating to management of funds and incurring of expenditure contrary to section 45(2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act, 2003. On count 2 he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the law relating to the management of funds and incurring of expenditures contrary to section 45(2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003; and on count 3 he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the Applicable procedures and guidelines relating to procurement and tendering of contracts contrary to section 45(9) (2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003.3.He was convicted of the first two counts and fined ksh. 400,000 on each count or 2 years imprisonment in default.Memorandum of Appeal4.Aggrieved by the judgment , he proffered this Appeal and set out the following grounds.1.That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering that at the time the case was brought against the appellant the ethics and Anti-corruption commission was not properly constituted.2.The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the fact that the report and recommendations of the DPP were forwarded when the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was not properly constituted.3.The judgment passed by the trial court is against the law, incorrect and inconsistent.4.The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in ignoring the contradictions of the prosecution witnesses and in particular on whether or not members of the inspection and acceptance committee conducted a market survey.5.The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in basing his decision to convict the appellant on the pronouncement of a valuation report prepared and uttered by unqualified persons and hence gave force to as documentary evidence, a document that is of no evidentiary value.6.The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in arriving at his verdict based on facts that were not part to the charges read to the appellant and which facts to the charges read to the appellant and which facts therefore he could not be called upon to answer to.7.The learned magistrate erred by giving weightage to the procedures of direct procurement while the charges the appellants were called upon to answer to had no relation to direct procurement.8.The learned trial magistrate erred in failing to read and consider the law as a whole and erred in holding that the findings of the evaluation committee was legally and absolutely binding and without room for discretion on the part of the appellants and particularly the procurement unit.9.The learned trial magistrate erred in law at failing completely to address the constitutionality of the arrest and prosecution of the appellant by failing to appreciate the fact that the investigations having been conducted during the absence of a duly constituted commission were in breach of the constitutional provisions which rendered both the investigations as well as the resultant recommendations to prosecute a nullity.10.The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in holding that the items or equipment were ordinarily available in the market thereby contradicting his own finding that the equipment had been prefabricated.11.The learned magistrate erred in failing to appreciate that in the entire hearing no evidence was adduced of criminal intent as imported by the word wilfully in the charges and hence imputed without proof.12.The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in placing reliance while convicting the appellant on case law that were civil in nature thereby in effect convicting on standard of proof to a balance of probability rather than beyond reasonable doubt.13.The learned magistrate failed to take into account the evidence in totality mitigating circumstances and elimination of extraneous considerations and pressure while passing the sentence.5.The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions .Appellant’s submissions6.The Appellant presented the following issues for consideration:a).Whether the ethics and anti-corruption commission was properly constituted at the time investigations were conducted by the EACC and whether the resultant recommendation to prosecute the appellants was a nullity.b).Whether the prosecution met its burden and proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.c).Whether the elements of the crime as set out under section 45 (2) of the Anti-Corruption and EconomicAct No. 3 of 2003were established.d).Whether the sentence imposed was too harsh and excessive.7.On whether the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission ( EACC) was properly constituted, the appellant submits that EACC did not have commissioners between the month of May 2015 and January 2016. That the last commissioner to leave office resigned on may 2015 , while the new ones were sworn into office on 23rdJanuary 2016.8.It is pointed out that according to the investigations officer who testified during trial, the recording of statements, the collection of exhibits and the commencement of the prosecution, took place when there were no commissioners in the office.9.The Appellant further argues that , it follows that the evidence collected during that period were null and void , rendering the entire trial a nullity. In this regard the Appellant has relied on the court of Appeal decision in the case of Michael Sistu Mwaura vs EACC& 4 others ( 2017) e KLR where the court of Appeal held that investigations and recommendations to Director of public prosecutions(DPP) must be authorized and sanctioned by the EACC commissioners.10.It is further submitted that looking at the core mandate of EACC the work of sanctioning investigation and making recommendations to DPP belongs to EACC as a corporate entity , who are required to exercise oversight over the secretariat and that there is nothing in the EACC Act that allows the EACC secretariat to pass by the commissioners in their recommendations.11.According to the appellant, upon the completion of an investigation, the commissioners are the ones responsible for reporting to the ODPP the reports of the investigations and making appropriate recommendation.12.The Appellant has further relied on the high court decision in Kakamega Criminal Appeal No. 90 of 2018 Ayub Tuvaka China and 4 others versus Republic where Justice Njagi pronounced himself on the commencement of investigation where the EACC commissioners were not constituted at the time the investigation began. In the said decision the Appellants were charged together with the Appellant herein at the chief magistrates court and the Appeal was against the same decision.13.The Appellant has finally relied on another high court decision inBusia County Government versus Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Milimani Constitutional petition No. 382 of 2015(d2016) eKLR where the Justice Onguto held that though the absence of the commission did not render the EACC extinct, the EACC had no powers in the absence of the commissioners, to initiate investigations on its own motion.14.The decisions in the cases ofRobert Cheruiyot vs. Republic Nakuru HCCRA No.3 of 2017and John Mwangi Maina & 2 others versus Republic (2018) and Gabriel Mburu Irungu vs. Republic were also relied on.Respondent submissions.15.The Respondent filed its submissions on 16thJanuary 2023, in which it confined itself to the issue of the late filing of the Appeal. The respondent further submitted that save for the issue of the time bar , they are not opposed to the Appeal.Determination16.This is a first Appeal and the mandate of this court is well settled . In the case of Odhiambo =versus= Republic (2005)eKLR the court of Appeal held ‘’On a first appeal the court is mandated to look at the evidence adduced before trial afresh, re-evaluate and re-asses it and reach its own independent conclusions. However it must warn itself that it did not have the benefit of seeing the witnesses when they testified as the trial court did and therefore cannot tell their direction (see Pandya =Vs= Pandya (1957) E A 336)”17.I have considered the memorandum of Appeal the lower court record and the parties submissions. I have identified the following issues for determination:a.Whether the Appeal herein was time- barredb.Whether the investigation , recommendation for prosecution and the prosecution of the Appellant in the lower court was illegalc.Whether prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.Whether the Appeal was time- barred.18.Let me first dispense with the only issue raised by the Respondent, namely the issue of the whether the Appeal was filed late and whether if any leave was sought for any late filing.19.The record shows that the issue of whether or not the Appeal was filed out of time was dealt with by my brother Justice J. A Wananda. Through the Ruling delivered on 25thJanuary 2023. He admitted the Appeal and deemed it to have been filed within the time. This issue is therefore moot.Whether the investigations , recommendation for prosecution and the prosecution of the Appellant was illegal20.The testimony of PW15, the investigation officer, attached to EACC , is relevant in this regard. He told the court that on 18/ 9/ 2015  he received instructions to carry out investigations regarding acquisition of wheel barrows by Bungoma county. He proceeded to procure several documents for that purpose . He further stated that he forwarded his findings to ODPP and the accused persons before court were eventually charged. I notice that the witness was not taken to task on the legality of his actions at the time or on whether there was a commissioner(s) in the office to give him Authority to conduct the investigation. Equally in his defence , the Appellant herein did not question the legality of the prosecution process as well as his prosecution. . The issue of the legality of the prosecution therefore is being raised for the first time in this Appeal.21.The next question then is whether the Appellant should be allowed to raise this issue on an Appeal yet he acquiesced on it during trial. In Mwangi v. Republic (2006) 2 KLR 94 the Appellate court was determining the legality of a lower trial based on unsworn evidence of prosecution witnesses, which issue had not been raised during trial . The court held interalia:  It does not matter that the issue is being raised for the first time in this appeal. If a trial was a nullity then it does not matter at what stage that issue is raised.”22.The main issue in this Appeal is the legality of the investigations and trial of the Appellant. Though the nature of the illegality was different in Mwangi’s case(supra), the issue to be determined is the same;- , namely whether the trial was a nullity due to its illegality. The principle set out in Mwangi’s case is therefore applicable to this case. Am duly guided . This court will therefore proceed to consider this issue notwithstanding the fact that it is being raise for the first time in this Appeal.23.The Appellant’s case is that , there were no commissioners in office at the time he was investigated and at the commencement of his prosecution, and therefore, the EACC was not properly constituted. That was the period between May 2015 and 23rdJanuary 2016, according to the Appellant. This submission has not been contested by the Respondent and therefore I will treat it as an admitted fact.24.It is further submitted that in the absence of the commissioners there was no one to sanction his investigation and recommendation for prosecution.25.To address this issue effectively it is imperative to look at the structure of EACC, its functions as an entity, the role of commissioners, and or against that of the secretariat. What central role do the commissioners play in the commission? In their absence, the commission ceases to function?26.The EACC is established pursuant to the provisions of Article 79 ofthe Constitution. TheEthics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act, No. 22 of 2011 was later enacted by the parliament to operationalize Article 79.27.Pursuant to Article 253 ofthe constitution, EACC , like other independent commissions established bythe constitution, is a corporate entity with a legal personality of its own, capable of suing and being sued and independent of the commissioners and/or its employees in any event.28.The functions of EACC is set out under section 11 of the EACC Act . Under section 11(1) (d) one of the functions , relevant to this case ,is to “ investigate and to recommend to the director of public prosecutions of any acts of corruption , bribery or economic crimes or violations of codes of ethics or other matter prescribed under this Act , the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act or any other law enacted pursuant to chapter six ofthe constitution.”29.The functions of the commissioners are found in section 11(6). The functions are:“a).assist the commission in policy formulation and ensure that the commission and its staff including the secretary perform their duties to the highest standards possible in accordance with this Actb).give strategic direction to the commission in the performance of its functions as stipulated in this Actc).establish and maintain strategic linkages and partnerships with other stakeholders in the rule of law and other governance sectord).deal with reports, complains of abuse of power; impropriety and other forms of misconduct on the part of the commission or its staff and;e).deal with reports of conduct amounting to maladministration including, but not limited to delay in the conduct of investigations and unreasonable invasion of privacy by the commission or its staff.”30.The responsibilities of the secretary of the commission is set out under section 16 (8) (c ) and it includes to : (i) carry out the decisions of the commission , (ii) day to day Administration and management of the affairs of the commission (iii) supervision of Employees of the commission , (iv) the performance of such other duties as may be assigned by the commission”31.The imperative , and indeed a preliminary question that needs to be answered is whether the commission, through its secretary, as head of the secretariat could carry out its legal mandate in the absence of commissioners.32In Ephantus M. Kagomo & 6 others vs Industrial and commercial Development corporation (2012) e KLR justice Odunga had this to say about the central role of directors in a Corporate entity: “A corporation is an artificial legal entity. Accordingly it must of necessity act through agents, usually the Board of Directors.In other words the corporation’s brain is the Board of Directors who make decisions on behalf of the company.A company may in many ways be likened to a human body; it also has hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with the directions from the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be said to represent the mind or will.Others are directors and managers who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control what it does. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of the company and is treated by law as such. The day to day management of the company may, however, be handled by specific officers tasked to do so on behalf of the Board. However, the ultimate responsibility rests with the directors. It therefore follows that the management of the corporation must be deemed to be carried by or on behalf of the Board save in cases where the ultra vires principle applies”( Emphasis added).33.Am of the view that the above central role of the board directors apply to any legal entity having a legal personality of its own. Depending on the structure of such legal entity the “ the brain of the company” in the words of Justice Odunga( supra) goes by the name : “Board of Directors,” “Board of trustees” “ Commissioners “ as in the case of EACC , or by whatever other name called.34.I entirely associate myself with the findings of justice Odunga in the above stated case, that is to say , ultimately it is the Board , or commissioners who are accountable of what happens in an organization, They must answer to the stakeholders and third parties.35.Further , with specific reference to EACC, the court of Appeal had this to say in mwaura kamau’s case ( supra), about the mandate of the Board of EACC: “It is the core mandate of EACC under section 11(1) (d) of the EACC Act to: ‘ investigate and recommend to the director of public prosecution of any acts of corruption , bribery of economic crimes or violation of codes goes by the name of ethics or other matter prescribed under this Act, the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act or any other law enacted pursuant to chapter six ofthe constitution: From that provision it is crystal clear to us that the functions of investigating and making recommendations to the DPP belong corporately to EACC and not to the secretary or secretariat alone. The investigations and the recommendations to the DPP must beauthorised and sanctioned by the commissioners who are required to exercise oversight over the secretariat and overall, to give strategic direction to EACC in the performance of its function under the Act. That is the position notwithstanding section 3 of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act which empowers the secretary or the person authorized by the secretary to conduct investigations on behalf on behalf of EACC.A proper reading of ACECA together with EACC Act ca not justify the conclusion that that officers to whom specific powers of EACC have been delegated can purport to bypass the EACC Commissioners who are ultimately responsible to the Kenyan people for the proper discharge of EACC’s constitutional and statutory duty” ( Emphasis added)36.On whether the secretary/ secretariat could act on its own , in the same Mwaura’s case ( supra), the court went on to state: Whereas we appreciate that the staff may, based on their areas of specialization, perform the duties for which they are appointed, to contend that they have a free hand to make binding recommendations arising from their duties without reference to the Commission, in our view would be absurd. The outcome of the tasks undertaken by the Commission’s staff must be ratified by the Commissioners if they are to be deemed as the decisions of the Commission otherwise unilateral actions taken by the staff may well be deemed to be insubordination”.37.Looking at the functions of the EACC Secretariat as set out in section 16(8) (c) (supra), apart from carrying out the decisions of the commission, it is evident that the other functions are purely the Administrative and management functions. In this regard , I find support again in the mwaura case where the court held that the investigations and recommendation of prosecution are key functions of the commission which the secretariat cannot carry out while bypassing the Commissioners .38.Am bound by the decision of the court of Appeal as set out in mwaura’s case. In the absence of the commissioners , the secretariat could not investigate and recommend to the DPP the prosecution of the Appellant herein. The entire process was a nullity.39.The investigation and the prosecution of the Appellant was therefore a nullity from the start. It can not be allowed to stand. The conviction and sentence is hereby quashed.40.The next question is whether a retrial should be ordered.41.The test as to whether a retrial should be considered was set out in the case of Opicho v. R [2009] KLR 369, 375 where the court of Appeal stated as follows:“In many other decisions of this Court it has been held that although some factors may be considered, such as illegalities or defects in the original trial; the length of time elapsed since the arrest and arraignment of the appellant;whether mistakes leading to the quashing of the conviction were entirely the prosecution’s making or not; whether on a proper consideration of the admissible evidence or potentially admissible evidence, a conviction might result from a retrial; at the end of the day, each case must depend on its own particular facts and circumstances and an order for retrial should only be made where the interests of justice require it.( Emphasis added).42.In the present case , the circumstances were that it was not just the trial that was illegal but the entire investigation was tainted with illegalities. It can not be said therefore that the admissible or potentially admissible evidence on record will secure a conviction if a retrial was to be ordered. Ordering for a retrial on the basis of such evidence will mean that the trial will suffer the same outcome. In the circumstances of this case therefore a retrial can not be the next course of action.43.I hasten to add that this conclusion does not bar the EACC from taking any further action against the Appellant as long as there is compliance with the EACC Act ,the Constitutionand other applicable laws .44.In the end this Appeal succeeds. The trial of the Appellant in Kakamega Chief Magistrate’s court EACC NO.1 of 2017 is hereby quashed and sentence set aside.DATED, SIGNED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI, VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS THIS 26THDAY OF AUGUST 2024.S.

      [2024] KEHC 10554 (KLR)Republic of KenyaIn the High Court at Nairobi (Milimani Commercial Courts)Commercial and TaxIncome Tax Appeal E156 of 2023A Mabeya, JAugust 27, 2024BetweenCommissioner of Domestic TaxesAppellantandW.E.C Lines Kenya LimitedRespondentRuling1.This ruling determines the application dated 11/10/2023 by the appellant. It was brought under section 32 of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act, Rule 10 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (Appeals to the High Court) rules 2015, Order 22 rule 22, Order 42 rules 4,6 and 7, section 79G of theCivil Procedure Act, Order 51 rules 1 and 3 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010, section 3 and 3A of theCivil Procedure Act.2.The application seeks orders that the memorandum of appeal be allowed and be deemed to be properly on record. That orders for stay of execution be issued pending the hearing and determination of the application.3.The application was supported by the grounds set out on the face thereof and the affidavit sworn by Christine Mwanja on 11/10/2023. It was contended that the time for filing an appeal against the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal had already expired. The delay in lodging the appeal was attributed to government bureaucracies, which resulted in the appeal being filed outside the statutory timelines.4.The appellant argued that the appeal was filed without unreasonable delay and was justified, as it raised important legal and factual issues. Additionally, the appellant noted that the respondent would not suffer any prejudice if the extension was granted and that it would be in the interest of justice to allow the appeal to be heard and determined on merit.5.The application was opposed vide a replying affidavit sworn by Leila Beatrice Kayoro sworn on 6/11/2023. She deponed that the appellant owed the respondent Kshs 52,673,752/- in VAT Refunds from the year 2005 to 2023 which amount continues to exacerbate.6.It was argued that the appellant had not satisfied the conditions for a stay of execution, as it failed to demonstrate substantial loss or provide security. The appellant could not claim it would suffer loss by repaying money that rightfully belongs to the respondent. It was further stated that the funds would help the respondent replenish its cash flow and any delay in receiving the refund would be unfair to it. That it should not be prevented from enjoying the fruits of its judgment.7.Parties filed their respective submissions which I carefully considered. The appellant submitted that the Court should exercise its discretion under section 3A and allow the appeal to be filed out of time. That the appellant should not be denied the opportunity to pursue its appeal. Counsel noted that the delay in filing the appeal was 25 days after receiving the certified copies of the proceedings and judgment. That this delay was not excessive as it had been explained.8.Regarding the stay of execution, counsel expressed concern that it was uncertain whether the respondent would be able to refund the money if the appeal was to succeed. The respondent had not filed an affidavit of means, leaving its financial status unclear. Additionally, counsel pointed out that there had been no unreasonable delay in bringing the application to court.9.For the respondent, it was submitted that judgment was delivered on 14/7/2023, giving the appellant 30 days to appeal, which expired on 14/8/2023. The appellant, however, filed the appeal 30 days beyond the statutory deadline without obtaining leave of Court. It was submitted that the appellant's failure to seek the court's permission before filing the memorandum of appeal violated procedural laws.10.The respondent’s Counsel submitted that the delay in filing the appeal was not adequately explained. Regarding the stay of execution, it was submitted that the appellant had not demonstrated any substantial loss it would suffer. That in any event, the appellant had not provided any security for the due performance of the decree.11.I have carefully considered the parties' arguments in their pleadings and the submissions on record. The first issue to be determined is whether the memorandum of appeal should be considered properly filed. The appellant stated that the Tribunal delivered its judgment on 14/7/2023, prompting the appeal against that decision. However, the time allowed for filing an appeal had already expired, and the appellant attributed the delay to government bureaucracies in issuing instructions to file the appeal.12.The timelines and procedure for filing appeals from the Tribunal are governed by section 32(1) of theTax Appeals Tribunal Act. This provision gives the court the discretion to extend the time within which an appellant may file a Notice of Appeal and a Memorandum of Appeal. It provides as follows: -“A party to proceedings before the Tribunal may, within thirty days after being notified of the decision or within such further period as the High Court may allow, appeal to the High Court, and the party so appealing shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the other party.”13.Other applicable provisions are section 53 of theTax Procedures Actand Rule 3 of the Tax Appeal Tribunal Rules 2015 Rules.14.The cumulative effect of the foregoing is that, a party has a right to appeal the decision of the Tribunal within 30 days of being notified of the decision. In Commissioner of Domestic Taxes v. Mayfair Insurance Company Ltd, ML HC ITA No. 31 of 2017 [2017] eKLR, the court held that its powers and discretion to extend time are unlimited but must be exercised judiciously.15.From the record, the decision of the Tribunal was made on 14/7/2023. The notice of appeal was served on 9.8.2023. The appeal was subsequently filed on 9/10/2023, resulting in a delay of 30 days. The Supreme Court has established additional guidelines that courts must consider when deciding on an application for an extension of time. See Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat V Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 7 Others, [2014] eKLR.16.Some of the considerations are, the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, public interest and the prejudice to be suffered by the other party.17.In the present case, the delay was for only 30 days. I have reviewed the appellant's reasons for the delay and I find that the 30-day delay is not excessive. Furthermore, the respondent will not suffer any prejudice if the appeal is allowed to proceed as it is.18.Regarding the stay of execution, I am alive to the twin requirements under Order 42 Rule 6. Rule 6(1) of substantial loss and security. The appellant contended that if the monies were released to the respondent the latter may not be able to refund the same were the appeal to succeed. I have considered that notwithstanding such a challenge, the respondent did not give any evidence to show its ability to refund the same.19.As to security, I am alive to the fact that the applicant is the official government’s revenue collector. Obviously, it is here to stay and has perpetual succession. It will be able to pay the sum any time it may be required tom do so unlike many government Ministries and Departments.20.I am alive that there is a Rapid Response initiative that has been put in place by the Principal Judge of the High Court. That if this appeal were to be filed forthwith, it can be determined before the end of October, 2024.21.For the foregoing reasons, I find the application to be meritorious and I allow the same. Due to the time between 2005 and now that the respondent states that it is suffering for being denied the refunds it claims, I make the following orders with strict timelines: -a.Time for filing the appeal is hereby extended as prayed and the Memorandum of Appeal on record deemed properly filed.b.The appellant to file and serve a Record of Appeal within 7 days of this Ruling.c.The respondent to file and serve its Statement of facts within 7 days of service of the Record of Appeal.d.The Appellant to file and serve own submissions within 7days of service of the Statement of facts.e.The respondent to file and serve own submissions within 7 days of service of the submissions by the appellant.f.Time is of the essence and any party who files any document outside the timelines set out hereinabove will result in the document being deemed struct out without the necessity of making an application for that purpose or any order for that purpose.g.Matter shall be mentioned before the DR on 26/9/2024 to fix this matter in the RRI Cause List.h.The costs of the application shall be in the Cause.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 27THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.A.

He denied the existence of any account as Ac No. 2045687623. That the other account numbers 2043113737 and 2043456130 were incorrect and did not exist.c.The 3rdgarnishee filed a replying and supplementary affidavit by Jackson Nyaga and Christine Wahome dated 21/9/2023 and 8/11/2023. It admitted holding 2 accounts holding a total of Kshs.28,035.12. That any debits made in the accounts were before the order nisi was served.d.The 4thgarnishee filed a replying affidavit by Mathew Kipngetich sworn on 6/10/2023. It admitted holding the subject account with Kshs.98.78 only.8.The parties filed their respective submissions which I have considered together with the authorities relied on. From the outset, it must be noted that garnishee proceedings are usually secondary and not primary execution proceeding. The primary execution proceeding is as between the decree-holder against the judgment/debtor.9.In Choice Investments Ltd vs. Jeromnimon (Midland Bank Ltd, Garnishee) [1981] 1 All ER 225 at page 227, the court stated that: -“There are two steps in the process. The first is a garnishee order nisi. Nisi is Norman-French. It means ‘unless’. It is an order on the bank to pay the £100 to the judgment creditor or into court within a stated time unless there is some sufficient reason why the bank should not do so. Such reason may exist if the bank disputes its indebtedness to the customer for one reason or other. Or if payment to this creditor might be unfair by preferring him to other creditors: see Pritchard v Westminster Bank Ltd [1969] 1 All ER 999, [1969] 1 WLR 547 and Rainbow v Moorgate Properties Ltd [1975] 2 All ER 821, [1975] 1 WLR 788. If no sufficient reason appears, the garnishee order is made absolute, to pay to the judgment creditor, or into court, whichever is the more appropriate.”10.In CG Waithima & Company Advocate vs Africa Merchant Assurance Company Limited; UBA Bank Kenya Limited & 2 others [2023] KEHC 2344 (KLR), the court held that: -“… in law, the onus placed on a Garnishee would only be discharged where it successfully establishes that the account or accounts covered by the Garnishee Order nisi do not exist in its system or if it exists, it is in debt and not in credit or that it has a right of set o? or lien which are due effective against the customer.”11.Finally, in Brookside Dairy Limited v Adoncan Njagi & 2 others; Cooperative Bank of Kenya & another (Garnishee) [2021] eKLR, the court held that: -“This Court is mindful that it cannot confirm a garnishee order where the account from which a debt is sought to be attached is non-existence. Court orders cannot be made in vain.”12.In the present case, the defendant’s principal claim is as against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs made a spirited defence claiming that the amount due was not Kshs.45m odd but that they had paid in excess of Kshs.26m. A statement of payment was produced to that effect. The plaintiffs also deposed that they were willing to surrender for valuation and subsequent sale of all the securities created to secure the decretal sum.13.Although the said offer was made on without prejudice to other claims being asserted by the plaintiffs, the decree-holder did not respond to the said assertions. This is so notwithstanding that the decree-holder filed a supplementary affidavit in which it could have responded to those claims.14.The question therefore that begs is, what is the amount due that any of the garnishees can be called upon to answer? Is it Kshs. 45m plus 18% or that amount less Kshs.26m? Further, in view of the paltry sum due in the acknowledged accounts, should the garnishees be pursued when the securities are being offered by the judgment-debtor to realize the decretal sum? I think in the circumstances of this case, it is better to pursue the judgment-debtor before pursuing the garnishees. In any event, the amounts due in the admitted accounts are paltry.15.In view of the foregoing, I find the application to be unmeritorious and the same is dismissed. I will not make any order as to costs.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 27THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.A.

It was brought under Order 5 Rules 1(3), 5 and 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules and sections 1A, 1B and 3A of theCivil Procedure Act. It sought the striking out of the plaint dated 30/8/2021 for failure to take out summons within the stipulated time.2.It was supported by the affidavit of Hedaya Malesi SWORN ON 3/5/2023. The grounds were that the suit was commenced vide the plaint dated 30/8/2021 which was accompanied with a Motion on Notice of even date. The Motion sought injunctive orders against the defendant restraining it from dealing with Molo/Sachangwani Block1/79 (“suit property”).3.That the two documents were served on 2/9/2021. That the defendant’s advocates on record filed a Notice of Appointment and replying affidavit to the Motion. That to-date, no Summons to enter appearance have ever been served upon the defendant as provided under Order 5 Rules 1 and 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules. That in the premises, the suit has abated by operation of law.4.The application was opposed vide a replying affidavit of Joy Othieno Ochieng sworn on 29/6/2023. It was contended that as at the date of swearing the affidavit, 3 years had not lapsed since the date of filing suit and the suit had therefore not abated. That failure to take out summons to enter appearance was an inadvertence of counsel and was caused by the urgency in the plaintiff’s application dated 30/8/2021 seeking to injunct re-advertisement and auction of the suit property.5.Counsel stated that immediately after the injunction application was heard, she would have taken out the Summons but she fell sick and her staff failed to bring the file to her attention. That the suit is based on a Charge made over 30years ago. That the failure to take out the summons was a technicality. She urged that the application be dismissed as no prejudice was caused by failing to include summons in the pleadings.6.The parties filed submissions which I have considered. I have also considered the many authorities cited by Learned Counsels. The defendant cited no less than 8 authorities in its contention that the failure to serve the summons was not a mere procedural step but a mandatory step which goes to the root of the suit.7.This is an application to strike out the suit on the grounds that summons were not taken out and that the suit has abated by dint of Order 5 Rule 1(6) of the Civil Procedure Rules.8.There are two schools of thought that exist on this matter. The first school of thought is that, by the use of the term ‘shall’ it is mandatory and the failure to comply therewith leads to the striking out of the suit. That the suit shall abate on failure to take out and serve the summons within 30days. Some of these cases include Grace Wairimu Mungai vs. Catherine Njambi Muya [2014] Eklr, Karandeep Singh Dhilon & Anor vs. Nteppes Enterprises Ltd & Anor [2010] eKLR and Tana Trading Ltd vs. National Cereals and Produce Board [2014] eKlr.9.The second school of thought is that, notwithstanding the use of the word ‘shall’, the suit does not nevertheless abate, the failure is curable and that each case has to be considered on its own peculiar circumstances. Some of the case under this school include Paulina Wanza Maingi vs. Diamond Trust Bank Ltd & Anor [2015] Eklr, Tropical Foods International & Anor Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank & Ano [2017] Eklr, Nairobi Aviation Ltd vs. Nation Media Group Ltd [2020] eKLR, Fredrick Kibet Chesire vs. Raymond W. Bomet [2006] Eklr.10.In Paulina Wanza Maingi case (supra), Aburili J held: -“In my humble view, since the purpose of summons to enter appearance is to notify the defendant and or invite them to defend the suit, … and six years having elapsed since this suit was instituted, it would be a traversity of justice to dismiss the suit for want of summons when the 1stdefendant has actively been participating in the suit.”11.In Amina Hersi Moghe & 2 Others vs. Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd & Anor [2021], Tuiyot J ( as he then was) held that: -“This Court identifies itself with the latter views. It takes the position that where, even without the issuance and service of summons, a Defendant enters appearance or files defence or otherwise actively participates in defending its position in proceedings without protesting that it has not been served then it will be taken to have waived its right to challenge the validity of the suit on account of failure to comply with Order 5 rule. Unless, and this is the condition, it can demonstrate that non-adherence to those provisions has prejudiced or caused it hardship which cannot be compensated in costs.”12.After careful consideration and soul searching, I will depart from the position I held in 2014 at the time of Tana Trading Ltd vs. National Cereals and Produce Board (supra). It is clear that the issuance and service of summons is meant to notify a defendant of the plaintiff’s claim and require the defendant to defend its position. If a defendant comes to know of the suit and appears and actively participates thereon, what prejudice does it suffer for not having been served with summons? I see none. No doubt the issuance and service of summons cannot be said to be insignificance in the prosecution of a suit, but in the interests of justice, its purpose should be considered in the overall administration of justice.13.In the present case, the suit was lodged on 30/8/2021. The plaint and Motion were served on 2/9/2021. Were the defendant not having participated subsequent thereto by appearing and filing its responses to the Motion, the suit would have abated on 2/10/2021. However, there was active participation by all the parties culminating in the ruling of 14/10/2022 which allowed the injunction application.14.What is at stake is land. The parties entered into a loan agreement whereby certain facilities amounting to Kshs.300,000/- were advanced to the plaintiff in 1993. The plaintiff alleges that he has since paid the same in full yet the defendant was demanding a sum of Kshs.1,372,806/- as at June, 2021. What prejudice has the defendant suffered with the failure to serve the summons? I see none. On the other hand, if the application is allowed, the plaintiff will not only suffer the monies he has already paid to the defendant but he will also lose the suit property.15.Further, the active participation of the defendant in the interlocutory proceedings coupled with the explanation of the sickness of the advocate for the plaintiff appeals to this Court to exercise its discretion in favor of sustaining the suit. In any event, the summons has since been issued and served, albeit after the filing of the present application. There is already a defence on record, though filed under protest.16.In view of the foregoing, I am inclined to support the second school of thought, that where a defendant actively participates in proceedings where summons have not been served, it would be unjust and unfair to allow such a defendant to turn around and seek the dismissal of such suit. The defendant should be taken to have been aware of the suit and be having participated as such, waives his right to seek the remedies under Order 5 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.17.Accordingly, I find that the application lacks merit and is dismissed. I will however, allow the costs in favor of the applicant of Kshs.15,000/-. Let the parties undertake pre-trials expeditiously before the Deputy Registrar.It is so ordered.DATED AND DELIVERED AT NAIROBI THIS 27THDAY OF AUGUST, 2024.A.
