Ruling










I. Introduction


1.
In a judgment delivered on 16
th
 March, 2023 the court in found favour of the claimant and made the following orders-
a.
A declaration be and is hereby issued that the dismissal of the claimant by the respondent was wrongful and unlawful.
b.
The claimant is awarded a total of Kshs2,123,736/= together with interest thereon from the date of this judgment less statutory deductions. The said sum is made of-
i.
Balance of salary for the month of          September, 2017…… Kshs164,571/=
ii.
Three months gross wage in    lieu of notice………… Kshs393,633/=
iii.
Compensation for wrongful and     unlawful dismissal equivalent to     12 months gross salary………Kshs1,574, 532/=
Total…………………………... Kshs2,132,736/=
This amount is subject to statutory deductions.
c.
All the other claims are denied.
d.
The claimant is awarded costs of this cause.
e.
The respondent is ordered to issue and deliver to the claimant a certificate of service within 30 days of this judgment.






2.
In a notice of motion dated 15
th
 December, 2023 (the application) filed under a certificate of urgency through Kiplenge, Andama & Makau Advocates the respondent (the applicant) is seeking the following:-
1.
Spent
2.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to order a stay of execution of the judgment delivered in this suit on the 16
th
 March, 2023 and rectified on the 23
rd
 March, 2023 pending the hearing and determining of this application.
3.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to order a stay of execution of the judgment delivered in this suit on the 16
th
 March, 2023 and rectified on 23
rd
 March, 2023 pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal against the said judgment.
4.
That the costs of this application be provided for.






3.
The application is expressed to be brought under Order 42 rule 6, Order 51 rule 1 and Order 63 of the Civil Procedure Rules, section 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
.






4.
The application is based on the grounds on the face of it and supported with the affidavit of Mutai K. Owen, the advocate for the respondent, sworn on even date, with several annexures thereto.






5.
In opposition to the application, the claimant filed grounds of opposition dated 18
th
 January, 2024 through Raydon Mwangi & Associates stating that the same is an abuse of the court process, and a delaying tactic and thus it should be struck out with costs.






6.
On 7
th
 February, 2024, the court directed that the application be canvassed by way of written submissions and granted stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the application. Mr. Mutai, counsel for the respondent, filed his submissions on 21
st
 February, 2024, while counsel for the claimant did not file any written submissions.








II. Analysis


a.      The respondent’s supporting affidavit


7.
In summary, the respondent is seeking a stay of execution of the judgment and the decree arising from the orders alluded to in the introductory part of this ruling.






8.
It is deposed that on 23
rd
 March, 2023 this Honourable Court proceeded suo moto under Rule 34 of the Employment and Labour Relations Court Rules, 2016 and rectified an arithmetical error in the decretal sum reducing the same to Kshs1,977,407.20/=.






9.
Thereafter, the respondent lodged a notice of appeal. However, the claimant filed an application in the Court of Appeal in Nakuru Civil Appeal No. E037 of 2023 praying that notice of appeal to be struck out.






10.
In a ruling delivered on 8
th
 December, 2023, the Court of Appeal ruled that the notice of appeal was not served upon the claimant within seven days as per Rule 79(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules and the same was struck out. The respondent filed an application under Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules seeking for extension of time to lodge another notice of appeal against the judgment in Nakuru Civil Applicati
on No. E114 of 2023
. As far as the evidence shows the application is still pending hearing and determination.






11.
It is deposed that the intended appeal against the judgment raises triable issues and that since there is no stay of execution against the said judgment, execution may be effected thus rendering the intended appeal nugatory. Further, it is deposed that the intended appeal is arguable and has high chances of success. It is further deposed that the respondent is willing to abide by any terms for stay of execution that the court may set.








b.      The grounds of opposition


12.
In the grounds of opposition dated 18
th
 January, 2024, the claimant (the respondent in the application) is opposed to the application on the following grounds -
1.
That the application is a non-starter, having no legal foundation whatsoever -
2.
That the application is legless and expressly violates the mandatory provisions of Order 42 rule 6(4) of the Civil Procedure since it is not based on a Notice of Appeal.
3.
That the court is functus officio having delivered its judgment and there is no valid appeal or pending application for review against its decision.
4.
That In any case the application is an abuse of the court process being a delaying tactic aimed at prolonging litigation and should be struck out with the costs.








c.      Submissions by the respondent’s counsel


13.
On the one hand, counsel for the respondent raised two issues for determination as follows - Whether the instant application satisfies the requirement for the grant of an order for stay of execution of the judgment; and, Who should bear the costs of the application.






14.
Counsel cited the Court of Appeal in Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal [1979] eKLR where it was held that the court has discretionary powers to grant or decline stay of execution. Counsel also cited RWW V EKW [2019] eKLR where the court highlighted the purpose of a stay for execution pending appeal.






15.
Counsel cited Order 42 rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides for the factors to be considered in an application for a stay of execution as follows -
(2)
No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.






16.
On the issue of substantial loss, it is submitted that the respondent stands to suffer substantially in the event that execution is enforced. It is submitted that if execution is allowed to proceed and the decretal sum is paid to the claimant and the appeal ultimately succeeds, the claimant will not be in a financial position to refund the decretal sum. It is further submitted that failure to grant the stay the execution will render the appeal nugatory and a mere academic exercise. Counsel cited Nicholas Stephen Okaka & Another V Alfred Waga Wesonga (2022) eKLR in support of that position.






17.
Counsel argues that the draft memorandum of appeal raises triable issues defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary as “subject or liable to judicial examination and trial”. Counsel also cited Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui vs Tony Ketter & 5 others [2013] eKLR wherein an arguable appeal was described as not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court and which is not frivolous.






18.
On the issue of unreasonable delay, it is submitted that there was an application dated 13
th
 December, 2023 seeking for extension of time to lodge the notice of appeal after the initial notice of appeal was struck out by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal (application) No. E037 of 2023.






19.
On the issue of security, it is submitted that the respondent is willing to comply with the conditions as may be set by the court and it has been proposed that the decretal sum be deposited in a joint interest-earning account in the names of the advocates for both parties.






20.
On the issue of costs, counsel relied on Republic V Rosemary Wairimu Munene, ex-parte application V Ihururu Dairy Farmers Co-operative Society Ltd submitting that the application be allowed with costs.










III. Determination


21.
The court has perused and considered the application, the grounds of opposition, and the written submissions filed by counsel for the respondent. The court identifies two issues for determination –
a.
Whether the stay of execution should be granted,
b.
Who should bear the costs of the application.






22.
Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules provides for the conditions for granting stay of execution to be –
Whether there will be substantial loss on the part of the applicant; Whether the application has been filed or made without unreasonable delay; and, Whether the security for costs in the due performance of the decree or order has been provided for or an undertaking to comply with any orders that the court may issue.






23.
In Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal [1979] eKLR the Court of Appeal held that a court has discretionary powers in granting or declining an application for stay of execution.






24.
On the issue of substantial loss, the respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent stands to suffer substantial loss if the stay is not granted in that the claimant has not demonstrated that she is capable of repaying the decretal sum in case the appeal ultimately succeeds.






25.
In James Wangalwa & Another V Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR the court held that execution does not automatically amount to substantial loss under Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, and the applicant should prove that the execution shall irreparably affect or negate the applicant’s core as the successful party in the appeal. In any event, a successful litigant is entitled to the fruits of a judgment.






26.
On the issue of unreasonable delay, the court notes that the application in Civil Appeal No. E037 of 2023 was struck out by the Court of Appeal and this court is of the view that the application for extension of time in Civil Appeal No. E114 of 2023 is just a delaying tactic to prevent the claimant from enjoying the fruits of a lawful judgment. There is no appeal pending hearing and determination.






27.
If there is no appeal pending hearing what would an order for stay be pending?






28.
The respondent has not satisfied the conditions for stay of execution as set out in Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules thus the application lacks merits and the same is hereby dismissed. An order for stay of execution shall be synonymous to this court sitting on appeal of its own orders. There is no appeal pending and this court is functus officio in the matter having pronounced itself in the impugned judgment.






29.
The court agrees with the claimant that the application has been filed in bad faith and the same amounts to abuse of court process.








IV. Costs


30.
The application is dismissed with costs to the claimant.








V. Orders


31.
For all the foregoing reasons, the notice of motion dated 15
th
 December, 2023 by the respondent lacks merits and the same is hereby dismissed with costs to the claimant.

Ruling










A. Parties And Their Representatives


1.
The Applicants, (the “Tenants”) are the lawful tenants of shops on property known as Title Number MSA/Block XXII/186 situated along Archbishop Makarios Road on Mombasa Island within Mombasa County (the “suit premises”).






2.
The Firm of Michael Ngure and Co. Advocates represents the Tenants in this matter.






3.
The 1
st
 Respondent, Engroup (K) International Limited is the registered proprietor of the suit premises and hence the Landlord (the “Landlord”).






4.
The 2
nd
 Respondent, Sure Auctioneers, have been instructed to distress for rent and hence are agents of the Landlord.






5.
The firm of Addulrahman, Saad, & Associates Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.








B. Background Of The Dispute


6.
Vide a ruling delivered by Hon. P. May delivered a ruling on 10
th
 September 2021 dismissing the Tenants’ References dated 15
th
 December 2020 and Applications dated 21
st
 May 2021 and validating the Landlord’s notice of alteration of terms seeking to increase rent from KShs. 10,000.00 to KShs. 50,000.00.






7.
Dissatisfied with this decision, the Tenants filed an appeal at the Environment and Land Court in Civil Appeal E059 of 2021: Mohammed Alwly & David Ngure Kienjeku v. EN Group (K) International Limited where Naikuni J. allowed the appeal by setting aside the ruling of this Court dated 10
th
 September 2021 and directing that this Court supervises the Parties’ deliberations on a fair, reasonable and equitable rental increment based on the current market rate and that the matter be mentioned on 18
th
 January 2024.






8.
When the matter was mentioned on 17
th
 July 2024, the Tenants’ Advocate, Mr. Omboga, submitted that Naikuni J. advised that the rent payable be reviewed by an independent valuer. Further, he noted that Gazette Notice No. 89 had been published indicating the compulsory acquisition of the suit premises by Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and the National Land Commission (NLC).






9.
The Court directed that the matter be mentioned on 26
th
 July 2024 for further directions on valuation reports and for the Tenants’ Advocate to give an update on the gazette notice for demolition of the suit premises as well as supply the Court with ELC decision in Civil Appeal No. E059 of 2024.






10.
As in all mediation cases which this was for all purposes intended to be by the High Court Judge to find a middle ground parties seem to have stood firm on their grounds and unwilling to negotiate. In the circumstances the Tribunal guided by the High Court ruling instructed parties to file submissions on their respective valuation reports as parties again placed reliance on their old reports and were not willing to file fresh ones.






11.
Subsequently, the Tenants filed their submissions dated 30
th
 July 2024 and the Landlord filed its submissions on 1
st
 August 2024.








C. Tenant’s Case


12.
The Tenants submit that while the parties are willing to deliberate on the rent payable, major changes affecting the landlord-tenant relationship were currently underway because the suit premises was to be demolished as per Gazette Notice Number 15192 and Gazette Number 89 dated 2
nd
 December 2024 and 10
th
 June 2024 respectively.








D. Landlords’ Case


13.
The Landlord submits that its valuation report dated 13
th
 October 2021 has merit and that the rent proposed was based on comparable along Archbishop Makarios road and factored in inflation affecting the country in totality.






14.
The Landlord further submits that since this matter was filed in Court, the Tenant has not made any rent payment and maliciously kept writing cheques in a different name other than that of the respondent, making it difficult for the Landlord to cash them out.






15.
The Landlord therefore prays that the Tenant be ordered to pay the rent arrears from December 2020 when this suit began to date and that the cheques be written in the Landlord’s name.








E. Jurisdiction


16.
The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.








F. List For Issues For Determination


17.
Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the issues that falls for determination are:
a.
What is the rent payable by the Tenants?
b.
Whether the Landlord is entitled to the rent arrears?








G. Analysis And Determination


What is the rent payable by the Tenants


18.
I note that the Environment and Land Court in setting aside the decision of the Tribunal directed that parties should be deliberate on a reasonable, fair and equitable amount of rent and advised that valuation be done by an independent valuer.






19.
However, there has been developments of impending demolition of the suit premises in light to two gazette notices produced by the Tenants listing the suit premises as part of land to be compulsorily acquired by the Government for the construction of the Mombasa gate bridge project.






20.
As rightly submitted by the Tenants, the aforementioned developments will ultimately have the effect of terminating the subsisting landlord tenant relationship in the near future, which may be by January 2025.






21.
Be that as it may, these events do not negate the Tenant’s obligation to pay rent. This Tribunal has a duty to ensure that justice is not only done but must be seen to be done. Besides, it is an implied condition of every lease that the tenant pays rent as and when it falls due, unless the Court directs otherwise.






22.
It therefore would be improper to allow the Tenants to get away with the nonpayment of rent which the Landlord alleges is for the period since this suit commenced, to date.






23.
The Tenants have not placed sufficient material before this Tribunal to demonstrate that they have been paying rent, even at the rate of Kshs. 4,500.00 and KShs. 10,000.00, the prevailing rate before issuance of the notice by the Landlord to increase the rent despite being in occupation of the suit premises.






24.
It is noteworthy that the valuation reports filed by the Parties herein indicate that the rate of Kshs. 4,500.00 and KShs. 10,000.00 is significantly low. The Tenant’s valuation report indicates that the rent payable as at 2021 is KShs. 24,000 while the Landlord’s Report indicates a rate of KShs. 40,000.






25.
Going by the Tenant’s valuation report, I note that two years have lapsed and the rent payable must be increased to reflect the current value of the property. Further, I note that the Valuer has not taken into consideration the service charge as well as Value Added Tax at the rate of 16%.






26.
In the circumstances, I am convinced that the rate of KShs. 24,000.00 ought to be increased by 10% after every two years to KShs. 26,400 per month and a service charge of KShs. 5,000.00. Additionally, VAT at a rate of 16% mut be added thereto to amount to KShs. 36, 424. 00.






27.
Accordingly, I find the amount payable as rent to be KShs. 36, 424.00 which ought to have been paid since August 2021.










H. Orders


28.
In the upshot the following Orders shall abide;
a.
The Tenants to pay any outstanding rent arrears of KShs. 1,347,688.00 within 14 days of the date hereof, failure to which the Landlord shall be entitled to levy distress for rent and to take back vacant possession with the assistance of OCS Central police Station, Mombasa; and the same shall be payable in the landlords name Engroup International Limited
b.
Tenant to keep paying rent at the rate of KShs. 36,424.00 and when it falls due until the process of compulsory acquisition is complete;
c.
Each party to bear their own costs.

Between




Paul Caleb Ajiba


 


Plaintiff




and




Dr Stephen Wandefu Manya


 


Defendant










Ruling










1.
The plaintiff is a communicant or parishioner, or, in the Kenyan parlance, member, of the ACK St. Barnabas Esikura Lugulu Parish, while the defendant is the Vicar in charge of St. Stephen ACK Parish in Nambale Diocese. In his suit, the plaintiff avers that the defendant was not properly appointed to his office, given that he previously served with the Mumias Diocese, and the Bishop for that Diocese did not release him, for transfer to the Nambale Diocese, to take charge of St. Stephen ACK Parish. He invites the court, in his plaint, for a declaration that the due process was not followed for the said transfer, and the appointment of the defendant, to his current position, was, therefore, not procedural, and that he was illegally in office.






2.
The plaint was filed simultaneously with a Motion, dated 22
nd
 January 2024, seeking that an order issues to restrain the defendant, or his agents, from conducting the affairs of St. Stephen’s ACK Parish, Nambale Diocese, on grounds that the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese had not released him for appointment as Vicar for the St Stephen’s Parish in Nambale. He argues that the defendant transferred himself to the said Parish, without the knowledge of the Mumias Bishop.






3.
The defendant reacted to that application, by an affidavit he swore on 5
th
 February 2024. He asserts that he is the Vicar-General for the Diocese of Nambale, serving at the St. Stephen’s Church, on appointment by the Bishop of Nambale. He further states that, following the appointment, he was duly installed as such, in a ceremony that was conducted by the Bishop of Nambale Diocese, on 21
st
 February 2024. He avers that he did serve at the Mumias Diocese, up to 2005, after which he left for further studies, in Nairobi, at Daystar University. He explains that, while studying at Daystar University, he was appointed, by the Bishop of the All Saints Cathedral Diocese, Nairobi, to serve at the St. Joseph Parish at Kabete. He also taught at Daystar University and Alupe University, and it was from the latter that he was appointed the Vicar-General. He complains that the suit herein is an attempt to scuttle his intention to vie for the position of Bishop of the Nambale Diocese.






4.
In a further affidavit, sworn on 14
th
 February 2024, the defendant avers that the Church has a constitution, which regulates the matters in dispute, and which provides for an internal dispute resolution mechanism, which the plaintiff has not exhausted. A copy of that constitution is attached.






5.
I gave directions, on 24
th
 April 2024, for canvassing of the said application, by way of written submissions. The only written submissions that I see in the record before me are by the defendant. He argues around the principles for grant of injunctive relief, and asserts that the threshold has not been met. He cites Giella vs. Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd [1973] EA 358 (Sir William Duffus P, Spry VP & Law JA), Mrao Ltd vs. First American Bank of Kenya Ltd [2003] eKLR (Kwach, Bosire & O’Kubasu, JJA), Kitur & another vs. Standard Chartered Bank & 2 others [2002] eKLR (Tunya, J), Pius Kipchirchir Kogo vs. Frank Kimeli Tenai [2018] eKLR (Ombwayo, J) and Showind Industries vs. Guardian Bank Limited & another [2002] eKLR (Ringera, J).






6.
The above decisions state the law, with respect to what should be established, for the purpose of persuading a court to grant the relief sought in the instant application. Has the threshold been met? I do not think so. There are several reasons.






7.
In the first place, I doubt that the plaintiff has any locus to bring a civil suit of this nature against the defendant. It turns on Church affairs. The plaintiff is not in a position of leadership within the Church, and he appears to have brought the suit in his personal capacity. The wrong, that he complains of, does not affect him as a person. He does not come from the same Parish with the defendant, according to his papers, and he has not attempted to explain why he would be aggrieved. The defendant was allegedly appointed the Vicar of the St. Stephen’s Parish, the plaintiff is from St. Barnabas Parish. What business does he have complaining about what goes on at St Stephen’s? How does it affect him? What loss would he personally suffer should the appointment remain in place? With profound respect to the plaintiff, the space or position from which he is prosecuting this suit projects him as a busy-body.






8.
In the second place, the plaint, as framed, as I understand it, is presenting a case in public interest, and, therefore, the plaintiff is suing the defendant in public interest. However, suits of that nature only work best in the realm of public law, against State entities, where Judicial Review, constitutional petitions and fair administration action suits are permissible. The Church is not in that space. It is not a State organ or entity, and public interest litigation is not suitable to agitate claims against it, or its officials.






9.
In the third place, the plaintiff is asserting that the defendant was serving under the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese, and could not transfer his services from the Mumias Diocese to another diocese, or accept appointment by another diocese, without being released or permitted to do so by the Bishop of Mumias. The plaintiff has not provided material to demonstrate that he is the official mouthpiece of the Bishop of the Mumias Diocese, or that he has the authority of that Bishop to pursue the case on his behalf. There is no proof that the said Bishop is aggrieved about the defendant, and even if he was, there is nothing to show that he has authorised the plaintiff to bring the suit, to articulate his grievance.






10.
In the fourth place, the Church is not personal property, where the plaintiff would have proprietary rights, neither is it a firm, where members or adherents would have shares, which would provide basis for litigation in the manner of the instant suit. The Church is a society, where the plaintiff would have interests, as opposed to rights. Courts are generally shy about entertaining suits over societal interests, given that such societies would have rules under which they play by, and it would be expected that any disputes would be resolved within those rules. The plaintiff would like the court to declare that due process was not followed in the appointment and transfer of the defendant, and that would presuppose that a certain process had been provided for such transfer and appointment, yet the plaintiff has not pointed at any rule or regulation that ought to have governed such transfer and appointment.






11.
In the fifth place, and related to the fourth, the Church, being a society, ought to be governed by certain rules, often referred to as a constitution, which regulates conduct of its affairs, and sets out how any differences and disputes, between members of the society, or between the members and the leadership, ought to be resolved. These are what are commonly known as internal dispute resolution mechanisms. The defendant has stated that the Church does have a constitution, and he has availed a copy, which provides for an internal dispute resolution mechanism, and has argued that the plaintiff did not exploit that mechanism before rushing to court. I have perused that constitution, and I have noted those mechanisms. The business or affairs of the Church should be run by the Church itself, and not the State, whether through the Executive or the courts. State intervention would be only in extreme cases, where there would be violation of the law, or breakdown of law and order, or a serious threat to those. The State trusts that the Church is capable of taking care of its own affairs, and intervenes only where it is established that the Church has failed in that regard. A member of a Church, who is aggrieved by anything that happens within the Church, is expected to raise the matter internally, and to seek to have it resolved within the internal Church structures, and should only approach the court where he has exhausted those mechanisms, or where the processes are carried out in violation of the law. The plaintiff has not demonstrated that he exploited the internal mechanisms established by the Church, without success, or the Church mechanisms operated in breach of the law relating to due process and fair hearing, or that he did not expect to get justice in that process.






12.
In the sixth and final place, the issue raised appears to touch on employment and labour relations. It is about an employee of the Church being appointed, and transferred. The High Court has no jurisdiction to address employment and labour relations issues. Whether a person is properly appointed to a position within an organisation, or society, such as a Church, and whether he is properly transferred from one station of work to another, within the organisation, is a matter of employment. Under Article 162(2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, promulgated in 2010, that jurisdiction lies with a court envisaged by that Article, which court was established by Parliament, in 2011, and designated the Employment and Labour Relations Court. 
The Constitution
 emphatically states, at Article 165(5) of 
the Constitution
, that the High Court shall not exercise jurisdiction over any of the matters reserved for the courts contemplated under Article 162(2). The High Court can only exercise jurisdiction, to a very limited extent, where the constitutional issue raised is framed under Article 165(3) of 
the Constitution
, and the same is not exclusively an employment issue.






13.
I do not think I should belabour the issue. I am not persuaded that a prima facie case, with probability of success, exists.  As indicated above, there is nothing to show that the plaintiff would stand to suffer damage of any kind, should the orders not be granted, for he has no personal interest in the matter, and the instant suit does not fall within the rubric of public litigation. There is no merit in the application, dated 22
nd
 January 2024, therefore, and I hereby dismiss it, with costs to the defendant. It is so ordered.

Tenant










Ruling










A. Parties And Their Representatives


1.
The Landlord, Adan Sharif, (the “Landlord”) is the lawful owner of Shop 1 & 2 erected on Plot No. 330 Block of Volcano Association, Ardhi river, within Machakos County (the “suit premises”).






2.
The Firm of Ibrahim, Issack & Company Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.






3.
The Tenant, Charles Nichodemus (the “Tenant”), is the tenant occupying the suit premises.






4.
The firm of Mukami Njeru & Associates represents the Landlord in this matter.








B. Background Of The Dispute


5.
Through a Reference and an Application dated 23
rd
 May 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Landlord moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders inter-alia: orders certifying the matter as urgent, evicting the Tenant from the suit premises and compelling the Tenant to clear all outstanding liabilities on their account in respect of electricity, water, generator fuel and maintenance in the sum of KShs. 20,000.00.






6.
Upon perusal of the Application, this Honourable Tribunal on 28
th
 May 2024 directed that the Landlord to serve the Application and Reference for hearing on 24
th
 June 2024 and subsequently file an affidavit of service.






7.
In response to the Tenant’s Application, the Tenant filed a Replying Affidavit dated 11
th
 July 2024.






8.
The Landlord filed submissions in support of his Reference and Application dated 19
th
 July 2024 and the Tenant subsequently filed his submissions dated 2
nd
 August 2024.






9.
It is the Landlord’s Reference and Application dated 23
rd
 May 2024 that is the subject of this ruling.








C. Landlors’s Case


10.
The Landlord avers that he served the Tenant with a notice to vacate dated 15
th
 April 2024 on the basis that the Tenant was making irregular rent payments which had led him to be in arrears of KShs. 20,000.00.






11.
Further, the Landlord submits that the Tenant had continuously breached other terms of the tenancy








D. Tenant’s Case


12.
The Tenant avers that the Landlord’s notice to vacate does not comply with the requirements espoused under Section 4(2) of Cap 301 and is therefore invalid.






13.
It is the Tenant’s case that the Landlord intends to let the suit premises to another tenant and has attached correspondence to that effect.








E. Jurisdiction


14.
The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.








F. Issues For Determination


15.
Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the sole issue that falls for determination is;
Whether the orders sought by the Landlord should be granted








G. Analysis And Determination


16.
The powers of the Business Premises Rent Tribunal are provided by the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter the Act). Section 12(1)(i) of the Act provides that:
4.
“In addition to any other powers specifically conferred on it by or under this Act, a Tribunal may investigate any complaint relating to a controlled tenancy made to it by the landlord or the tenant, and may make such order thereon as it deems fit.”






17.
This Tribunal notes the parties herein entered into an oral tenancy agreement which amounts to a controlled tenancy that is subject to the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court and whose termination should be in compliance with Section 4 (2) of Cap 301 which provides:
“
A Landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy or to alter to the detriment of the Tenant any term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the Tenant under such a tenancy shall give notice in that behalf to the Tenant in the prescribed form.”






18.
Further, Section 4 (4) of Cap 301 provides that:
“
No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party, as shall be specified therein:
Provided that—
ii.
where the terms and conditions of a controlled tenancy provide for a period of notice exceeding two months, that period shall be substituted for the said period of two months after the receipt of the tenancy notice;






19.
I have perused the notice of termination dated 15
th
 April 2024 issued by the Landlord. I note that the notice lacks form as the same is a letter as opposed to the prescribed form under Cap 301.






20.
Additionally, the notice lacks substance for the reasons that; it provides for a termination period of 28 days as opposed to the two months’ notice period and it does not require the Tenant to respond in writing indicating whether or not he is willing to comply with the notice. convinced that the same falls short of the requirements of Section 4 of Cap 301.






21.
In the circumstances, I find that the notice of termination dated 15
th
 April 2024 falls short of the requirements for termination of a controlled tenancy under Section 4 and hence, is invalid.






22.
Be that as it may, I note that the Tenant has been making irregular rent payments and has not paid rent for several months as per the Landlord’s Mpesa statements dated 6
th
 May 2024 accumulating arrears in the sum of KShs. 40,000.00. It is an implied term of every tenancy that the Tenant pays rent as agreed by the parties to the tenancy.








F. Orders


23.
In the upshot the Landlord’s Reference and Application dated 23
rd
 May 2024 are hereby partially allowed in the following terms;
a.
The Tenant to clear any outstanding arrears within 14 days failure to which the Landlord shall be at liberty to distress for rent;
b.
The tenant to pay rent on or before the 10
th
 of every month without fail, failure to which the Landlord will be at liberty to distress and take back vacant possession with the Assistance of OCS Athiriver police station.
c.
The Landlord is at liberty to issue a fresh notice; and
d.
Each party to bear their own costs.

and




Stephen Mwangi


 


Interested Party










Ruling










A. Parties And Their Representatives


1.
The Respondent/Applicant, Boniface Kamande Kinyanjui, instituted this suit (hereinafter known as the “Applicant”).






2.
The Applicant is represented by the Firm of Mwaura Kelvin Karuga & Associates Advocates.






3.
The Tenant/Respondent, Patrick Muiruri Kamau, is the Tenant of a rented business space known as Victory Choma Roast (hereinafter known as the “Tenant”).






4.
The Tenant is represented by the Firm of Daniel Henry & Company Advocates.








B. Dispute Background


5.
This Honourable Tribunal vide a Ruling dated 17th January 2023 made Orders inter alia:
I.
Status quo be maintained and the Tenant to continue paying rent to the Interested Party, the Landlord of the premises as per the Lease Agreement entered into by the two parties.
II.
The Respondent to cater for the losses incurred by the Applicant as a result of the illegal closure of the business premises contrary to CAP 301 assessed at KShs.90,000 within 30 days.
III.
The Respondent to cover the Applicant’s costs of the suit assessed at KShs.10,000.






6.
Subsequently, the Applicant filed a Notice of Motion Application dated 23rd January 2024 seeking orders inter alia that this Tribunal be pleased to set aside and /or quash the Judgment dated 17th January 2023 pending the hearing and determination of this application.






7.
It is this application that is the subject of this Ruling.








C. The Applicant’s Claim


8.
The Applicant contends that the Ruling was rendered in his absence, as the law firm of M/S Solomon Mugo & Co. Advocates, whom he had instructed to represent him, failed to act despite being provided with the mention and hearing notices.






9.
Furthermore, he asserts that the failure of his advocates to act led to an unfavourable Ruling which ordered that he must pay the Tenant Kshs.90,000 as damages for the closure of the business premises and Kshs.10,000 as costs of the suit.






10.
He maintains that the issuance of the Ruling occurred without his participation contrary to the principles of natural justice.






11.
The Applicant avers that the execution of the Ruling and any resulting Decree would result in irreparable loss, injury, and damage to him.






12.
Additionally, he avers that the errors of his counsel should not be attributed to him as an innocent litigant.








D. The Tenant’s Defence


13.
The Tenant filed an undated Replying Affidavit and a Supplementary Affidavit dated 19th March 2024 both sworn by Patrick Muiruri Kamau.






14.
He avers that court proceedings are adequate enough to demonstrate who attended court on a particular day and what transpired on the said day.






15.
Furthermore, he contends that the only means for the Tribunal to ascertain attendance is by reviewing the court proceedings, as he has adequately highlighted.






16.
The Tenant maintains that the Ruling can only be overturned if the Applicant has fulfilled the necessary requirements, which, in this instance, the Applicant has failed to do. He characterizes the Applicant's Application as an afterthought, as no reasons have been provided to justify why the requested prayers should be granted.








E. Issues For Determination


17.
I have given full consideration to the parties’ pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal, and in my respectful view, I find that the sole issue that falls for determination is:
Whether this Tribunal should set aside and/or quash its Ruling and orders delivered on 17th January 2023.








F. Analysis And Determination


18.
Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 Cap 21 provides as follows: -
“
Any person who considers himself aggrieved—
a.
by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
b.
by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.”






19.
Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows: -
“


1.
(1)
Any person considering himself aggrieved—
a.
by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
b.
by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”








20.
In Republic v Public Procurement Administrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] e KLR it was held: -
“
Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”






21.
Flowing from the above, the issue for determination is whether the applicant has satisfied any of the conditions set out in Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules.






22.
The Applicant has not presented any evidence indicating the grounds as outlined in the aforementioned jurisprudence, which is necessary for seeking a review.






23.
It should also be noted that the application herein was made one year after the Ruling was rendered. It is trite law, as per Order 45 Rule (1) (b), that an application for review should be made without unreasonable delay.






24.
With regard to delay in seeking review, the Court, in Stephen Gathua Kimani vs. Nancy Wanjira Waruingi t/a Providence Auctioneers [2016] eKLR, stated:
“
One thing is clear in this application. The delay of one year has not been explained. Perhaps, it’s important to recall the last sentence of Order 45 Rule 1 (1) (b) which reads “… may apply for review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”
The logical question that follows is, was the present application made without unreasonable delay? Or is a delay of one year reasonable. The issue for determination is whether or not the applicant has unreasonably delayed in filing the present application. Under normal circumstances it should not take an applicant one year to file an application in court. It would require sufficient explanation to justify a delay of one year. To my mind this is a long period, and indeed an unreasonable delay.”






25.
In the present case, the applicant, has not addressed the delay in filing the application for review, let alone the reasons for it. The delay is, therefore, not explained. It is my view that a delay of one year is gross and unreasonable, and, therefore, the orders sought in the instant application cannot be available for granting. Only issue raised is the ruling was delivered in his absence thus denying him right to be heard a ruling is at the tail end after hearing of parties and not attending to the same would not culminate into a breach of a right to be heard as parties were already heard.






26.
In the upshot, the applicant has utterly failed to provide sufficient grounds to justify grant of the orders sought in the application, dated 23
rd
 January 2024.








G. Determination


27.
In the upshot, the following orders shall abide:
a.
The Review Application dated 23rd January 2024 is dismissed based on unreasonable delay. Review must be within reasonable time.
b.
Each party to bear their own costs.

th
 April 2024.
ii.
That prior to the notice herein, the landlord/respondent without any reason on 19
th

iv.
That the applicant reported the matter to Ukunda Police station who commenced investigation and forwarded the file to the DPP for possible criminal prosecution.
v.
That when the respondent/landlord was told by the O.C.S Ukunda Police station to fix the door, the landlord said he had sold it, forcing the tenant to replace it at her own cost of KES. 36,000 in order to secure her tools of trade.






4.
This court granted interim orders of injunction dated 8
th
 May 2024 pending hearing of the application inter-partes.






5.
The application is opposed vide a replying affidavit dated 29
th
 May 2024 wherein the landlord/respondent deposes as follows; -
i.
That the application is totally incompetent and an abuse of the court process.
ii.
That the applicant had defaulted in rent payment with respect to the suit premises for 7 months in 2023.
iii.
That on several occasions, the landlord’s agents one Coast View Agencies, confronted the tenant on her default in settling rent arrears, however the tenant always gave false promises.
iv.
That the receipts annexed by the tenant to her supporting affidavit are a fabrication. That the said agents could not issue receipts for January to March when the tenant had arrears for previous months.
v.
That in an attempt to evade payment of rent arrears, the applicant presented false accusations before the police in Diani Police station and accused the landlord of breaking the door to the suit premises and stealing items.
vi.
That the police in their wisdom found no merits in the applicant’s accusations against the respondent hence no charges were preferred.
vii.
That based on the tenant’s offensive conduct, which affected the landlord-tenant relationship, the landlord proceeded to issue the eviction notice.
viii.
That the applicant ought to have responded to the notice prior to filing the reference herein.
ix.
That the applicant has not provided any evidence regarding the allegations that she incurred costs of replacing the alleged broken door and hiring of a guard.






6.
At a court hearing on 6
th
 June 2024, the tribunal ordered that the application be disposed of by way of written submissions and the applicant/tenant was granted leave to file a further affidavit.






7.
The tenant/applicant filed a supplementary affidavit dated 19
th
 June 2024 wherein she deposes as follows; -
i.
That the landlord is a person who always practice impunity without regard to the law and that this is not the first time for the tenant to be in court due to the landlord’s harassment and unlawful action.
ii.
That sometime in June 2023, the landlord unlawfully in a move to illegally enforce a verbal notice, disconnected the tenant’s electricity supply and the tenant was forced to file an application dated 17
th
 June 2023 subject of BPRT No. E142 of 2023 for remedy. A copy of the order is annexed and marked “A”.
iii.
That the allegations that the tenant has not paid rent and the receipts are fabricated are untrue.
iv.
That after finalization of BPRT No. 142 of 2023 in which the tenant was awarded costs of KES. 15,000, the parties sat down in the presence of a villager Chairman known as “Mzee wa Mtaa” and calculated all the rent arrears which the landlord had refused to accept in an attempt to enforce the said verbal notice and the total thereof in the sum of KES. 35,000 was paid on 13
th
 December 2023 where the landlord acknowledged receipt of the same by signing an acknowledgment note and directed that the rent paid be remitted to the agent, one Coast View Agencies.
v.
That the landlord welded and removed the door to the suit premises. Copies of the acknowledgement signed by the landlord and the village elder, receipts of purchase of the new door and of the shaving machines and blow-drier, and picture of removed door are annexed as “B”.
vi.
That the respondent cannot speak on behalf of the investigating officer and nothing has been presented to this court to show that the investigations are complete.






8.
Both parties complied by filing their written submissions. The tenant filed hers dated 19
th
 June 2024 and the landlord filed his dated 26
th
 June 2024. We shall consider both submissions while dealing with the issues for determination.








B. Issues for determination


9.
The following are the issues for determination; -
a.
Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5
th
 April 2024 is valid and lawful.
b.
Whether the tenant/applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 6
th
 May 2024.
c.
Who shall bear the costs of the application?






Issue (a) Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5
th
 April 2024 is valid and lawful.


10.
The landlords herein issued a notice to vacate dated 5
th
 April 2024 which is annexed to the applicant’s supporting affidavit.






11.
In the case of Manaver N Alibhai t/a Diani Boutique – vs- South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was held as follows: -
“
The Act lays down clearly in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated and no term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of any such tenancy shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”






12.
In the instant case, we have perused the impugned notice to terminate tenancy and we note that the same is not in the prescribed form according to Cap 301 laws of Kenya.






13.
We therefore find that the respondent’s/landlord’s insistence on the tenant vacating the suit premises contravenes Section 4(2) of Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya and it is in this regard that we find that the Notice to Vacate the suit premises dated 5
th
 April 2024 is null and void ab initio.








Issue (b) Whether the tenant/applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 6th May 2024.


14.
The tenant/applicant approached this tribunal seeking for orders to restrain the landlord from evicting or interfering with her tenancy in any manner as well as compensation for costs incurred due to the landlord’s illegal actions.






15.
We have already established that the notice to terminate tenancy dated 5
th
 April 2024 is unlawful and illegal, therefore the tenant’s plea for restraining orders against eviction or interference shall be granted as prayed.






16.
The landlord avers in his written submissions that the tenant was in rent arrears which caused him to issue the impugned notice to terminate tenancy. The tenant on the other hand tendered evidence of rent payment to the landlord’s agent for the months of January to March 2024 which the landlord disputes and claims that the said receipts are forged.






17.
Upon perusal of filed documents in this matter, we find that the landlord has not filed any rent account statements to demonstrate the tenant’s rent arrears. There being no proof on the landlord’s side, the tribunal shall order that the tenant continues to pay rent as and when the same falls due.






18.
On the issue of compensation, the tenant in her written submissions refers the court to pictures showing her shop without a door which are annexed to her supplementary affidavit.






19.
The tenant states that as a result of the landlord’s action above mentioned, the tenant lost her items to wit, 3 shaving machines and blow drier worth KES. 32,800 as per the attached receipts, and also spent KES. 36,000 for buying and fixing a new door to secure her items.






20.
The landlord on the other hand in his written submissions states that the tenant has not presented any evidence regarding the allegations that the respondent broke the door to the suit premises and the losses allegedly incurred as a result thereof.






21.
In addition, the landlord states that the receipts annexed to the applicant’s supplementary affidavit only shows purchase of the items and do not constitute evidence of theft of the items in question. Furthermore, the landlord avers that the receipt with respect to the purchase and fixing of the door is not a confirmation that the door in question was for the suit premises and that the tenant has annexed unclear photos showing the alleged broken door.






22.
We have perused the photographs annexed to the tenant’s supplementary affidavit and we agree with the landlord that they are not clear. Consequently, there is not enough proof on the issue of the broken door therefore this tribunal is unable to issue orders with regard to compensation of the alleged broken door.






23.
On the issue of the missing items, we have perused the said receipts of the items, however there is not enough proof to demonstrate that the said items were stolen from the suit premises. The said receipts are purchase receipts of the items which does not amount to sufficient evidence that the items were lost as a result of the alleged breaking of the door to the suit premises.






24.
The tenant has also not shown any evidence of paying a guard for 8 days at the rate of KES. 2,000 per day for the period after the landlord had allegedly broken the door to the suit premises.






25.
It is trite law that “he who alleges must prove”. Based on the above analysis, the tribunal is unable to grant the orders of compensation that the tenant has sought in the application.








Issue (c) Who shall bear the costs of the application?


26.
Under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya, costs of any suit before this Tribunal are in its discretion but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall order costs of the application to the tenant/applicant.










C. Orders


27.
In conclusion, the following final orders commend to us; -
a.
The notice to terminate tenancy dated 5
th
 April 2024 is declared defective and unlawful.
b.
The application dated 6
th
 May 2024 is allowed in terms of prayers 2, 3 and 7.
c.
The tenant shall continue to pay rent as and when the same falls due and payable.
d.
The landlords are at liberty to issue a proper notice to terminate tenancy in the prescribed form in accordance with Section 4(2) of Cap 301 Laws of Kenya.
e.
Costs of KES. 25,000 to the tenant to be offset against the rent account.




It is so ordered.

4.

B. Dispute Background


5.
On 27
th
 October 2023, this Honourable Court delivered a ruling allowing the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 30
th
 may 2023 in the following terms:
a.
The landlady’s preliminary objection dated 14
th
 June 2023 is hereby dismissed.
b.
The Landlady’s notice of alteration of terms dated 6
th
 September 2022 and the notice of termination dated 23
rd
 February 2023 are invalid.
c.
The tenant to remain in the premises and continue to pay rent as and when it falls due and to enter into a formal lease with the Landlady.
d.
Landlady at liberty to issue fresh and proper notice to the tenant.
e.
Each party to bear its own costs.






6.
Subsequently, the landlady issued a notice of termination dated 5
th
 April 2024 on the grounds that the Tenant has continued to make irregular payments and has failed to formalize the tenancy despite being given ample time to review and consider the terms of the lease.






7.
On 18
th
 July 2024, the Landlady moved this Court vide a Notice of motion Application under a Certificate of Urgency seeking eviction orders against the Tenant to which the Tenant opposed in a Repying Affidavit dated 20
th
 August 2024.






8.
It is the Landlady’s Application dated 18
th
 July 2024 that is the subject of this ruling.








C. Claim And Defence


9.
It is the Landlady’s claims that the Tenant has failed to comply with the Court’s directives issued vide the Ruling delivered on 27
th
 October 2023. The landlady avers that the Tenant has continued to make irregular rent payments and formalize the lease despite been given ample time to review and consider the terms of the lease and being reminded severally.






10.
The Landlady avers that based on the above grounds, she issued the Tenant with a notice to terminate dated 5
th
 April 2024 with an effective date of 1
st
 July 2024, which notice period has lapsed yet the Tenant has declined to vacate the suit premises.






11.
In his Replying Affidavit dated 20
th
 August 2024, the Tenant avers that he has been paying rent and has already cleared the arrears owing but the Landlady has not been issuing him with receipts which he did not produce as proof of payment.






12.
Further, the Tenant avers that he is willing to make good the payments record going forward.








D. Issues For Determination


13.
I have carefully analyzed all the Pleadings filed and the relevant evidence adduced before honorable Court. I considerately find that the issues that fall for determination are:
Whether this Court should grant the Orders sought.








E. Analysis Of The Law


Whether this Court should grant the Orders sought.


14.
I have carefully perused the Ruling delivered by this Honourable Court dismissing the Landlady’s Preliminary Objection and allowing the Tenant’s Application on the grounds that the notice of termination issued was invalid and hence, ineffective.






15.
Consequently, this Court directed that the Tenant continues to pay rent as and when it falls due and to formalize the tenancy between him and the Landlady.






16.
I note that the Landlady has produced before this Court bank statements that clearly indicate the Tenant’s irregular rent payment while the Tenant has not produced any material to prove that his rent payment is up to date.






17.
Further, the Landlady has attached a letter dated 13
th
 March 2024 where she indicated that the Tenant was yet to share his comments on the draft lease and imploring the Tenant to pay rent in full and on time.






18.
In light of the above, it is clear that the Tenant has failed to comply with this Court’s directives.






19.
Additionally, the Tenant did not challenge the Landlady’s notice to terminate which I find valid and to be in compliance with the requirements of terminating a controlled tenancy as per Section 4 (2) of Cap 301.






20.
It is noteworthy that the Landlady’s right to property, which right includes the right to get a return on his investment, is protected under Article 40 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010.






21.
Besides, it is an implied term of every Tenancy that the Tenant pays full rent as agreed and to pay the same on time.










F. Determination


22.
The upshot is that the Landlady’s Notice of Motion Application dated 18
th
 July 2024 is allowed in the following terms:
a.
The Tenant shall pay any outstanding rent arrears within 14 days and give back vacant possession to the Landlady within 30 days. Failure to which the land lady shall be at liberty to break in with the assistance of OCS Kamkunji Police Station.
b.
Each party to bear its own costs.

II. Affidavits


7.
As indicated above the respondent is seeking for stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of an intended appeal. There is a notice of appeal annexed to the application dated 26
th
 September, 2023, and filed on 28
th
 September 2023, four (4) days after the judgment was delivered.






8.
In the supporting affidavit it is deposed that the decretal sum is substantial and that the claimant’s assets are not within the knowledge of the respondent and the respondent shall suffer substantial loss unless stay of execution is granted.






9.
It is deposed that the respondent has discharged the legal burden by demonstrating that on reasonable grounds the claimant is incapable of repaying the decretal sum if the appeal ultimately succeeds. Further, it is deposed that the respondent moved to court within reasonable time and it is willing to provide security for the due performance of the decree as by it may be directed by this Honourable court.






10.
In the replying affidavit, the claimant deposed that the application is an abuse of the court process, a delaying tactic, and that the same does not meet the legal threshold for stay of execution to issue. it is deposed that if allowed the stay shall cause substantial loss to the claimant.






11.
Further, it is deposed that the respondent has not provided security for due performance of the decree hence making the application unmerited and prejudicial to the claimant if granted.

It is deposed that the claimant is a financially stable business owner with uniform shops across Kenya. It is further deposed that the respondent has failed to prove that it is likely to suffer substantial loss if the decree is executed.






13.

It is deposed that if a stay of execution is granted, the court should direct the respondent to deposit the entire decretal sum in an interest-earning account in the joint names of advocates for the parties.








III. Submissions By Counsel


14.
Counsel for the respondent submitted on the principles for granting stay of execution pending appeal as provided for under Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides that -
(2)
No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.






15.
Counsel cited the case of Kiambu Transport vs Kenya Breweries on conditions applicable for stay of execution.






16.
On the issue of unreasonable delay, counsel argues that the notice of appeal was filed within the seven days period provided for under Rule 77 of the Court of Appeal rules after the impugned judgment was delivered on 21
st
 September, 2023.






17.
On the issue of substantial loss, counsel argues that the logbook furnished by the claimant was not accompanied with a valuation report and no proof of ownership of the alleged business was availed. Counsel further argues that if the appeal ultimately succeeds the respondent will not be in a position to recover the decretal sum from the claimant hence substantial loss. Counsel cited Mukuma V Abuoga (1988) KLR 645, Tropical Commodities Suppliers Ltd & Others V International Credit Bank Ltd Misc Applicati
on No. 379/2003
 which cited Antoine Ndiaye V African Virtual University [2015] eKLR and Daniel Chebutul Rotich & 2 Others V Emirates Airlines Civil Case No. 368 of 2001 on what amounts to substantial loss.






18.
On the issue of proof of ability of a decree-holder to repay the decretal sum, counsel cited ABN Amro Bank V Le Monde Foods Ltd Applicati
on No. 15 of 2002
, 
National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd V Aquinas Francis Wasike & Anor Civil Application No. 238 of 2005
(UR 144/2005); and Alhyder Trading Company Ltd V Lucy Jepngetich Mibei (2016) eKLR. Counsel submitted that the claimant admitted that she is unemployed and that she has failed to demonstrate her ability to repay the decretal sum in case the appeal ultimately succeeds.






19.
On the issue of security, counsel argues that the respondent is willing to tender security in accordance with Order 42 rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules and that it is willing to have the decretal sum deposited in an interest earning account in the joint names of the advocates for the parties within 60 days. Counsel cited Vista Holdings International Limited V Span Image (K) Limited [2014] eKLR and Nduhiu Gitahi Warugongo [1988] KLR; 1 KAR 100 [1988-92] 2 KAR 100 on provision of security in an application for stay.








IV. Determination


20.
The primary and overriding objective and duty of this court is to do justice in accordance with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
, Sections 1A, & 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, and Section 3 of the Employment & Labour Relations Court Act, amongst many other provisions of the law.






21.
Order 42 Rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules grants this court discretionary powers in allowing stay of execution considering factors such as - Whether the appeal raises triable issues; Whether the appeal shall be rendered nugatory if stay is denied; Whether the decree-holder has the ability to repay the money in the case the appeal ultimately succeeds. See - Butt V Rent Restriction Tribunal (1979) KLR.






22.
The application was filed on 2
nd
 November, 2023 and a notice of appeal was filed on 28
th
 September, 2023, four days after the judgment was delivered. Further, the respondent has offered to provide security in due performance of the decree pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.






23.
In Absalom Dova V Tarbo Transporters (2013) eKLR the Court of Appeal interpreted Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules on stay of execution pending an appeal to a superior court as follows -
“
The discretionary relief of stay of execution pending appeal is designed on the basis that no one would be worse off by virtue of an order of the court, as such order does not introduce any disadvantage, but administers the justice that the case deserves. This is in recognition that both parties have rights. The Appellant to his appeal which includes the prospects that the appeal will not be rendered nugatory, and the decree holder to the decree which includes full benefits under the decree. The court in balancing the two compelling rights focuses on their reconciliation.”






24.
In the interest of justice, therefore, the court shall allow the application on the terms set hereunder.








V. Costs


25.
The costs of the application shall abide with the costs in the appeal.








VI. Orders


26.
The notice of motion dated 2
nd
 November, 2023 by the respondent is allowed on the following terms -
a.
Stay of execution be and is hereby granted pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal.
b.
The respondent shall within 30 days of this ruling –
i.
Pay a sum of Kshs1,500,000/= to the claimant.
ii.
Deposit the balance of Kshs1,375,000/= in a joint interest-earning account to be opened in the joint names of the law firms for both parties in a different but reputable financial banking institution other than the respondent.
c.
In default of (b) above, the stay of execution shall automatically lapse.
d.
Costs of the application shall be in the appeal.

the Constitution
, Rule 11(1)(2) & (4) of the Advocates (Remuneration)(Amendment) Order 2014, & Sections 1A, 1B, & 3A of the

th
 February, 2024.








II. Evidence/affidavits


11.
Essentially, the application by the client is seeking for leave to file a reference (essentially an appeal or review) of the taxation done by the taxing officer, alluded to in the introductory part of this ruling, out of time. The other prayer is for stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the application, which was allowed by consent as stated in an earlier part of this ruling. There is no express prayer for stay of execution pending the filing, hearing, and determination of the intended reference.






12.
In the supporting affidavit, it is deposed that after the advocate/client bill of costs was taxed at Kshs482,012.50 the advocate applied for execution and warrants of attachment were issued and the client’s moveable properties were proclaimed for attachment and sale through public auction in satisfaction and settlement of the amount due and payable.






13.
The impugned ruling on taxation was delivered on 3
rd
 October, 2023 while the warrants of attachment were issued on 22
nd
 November, 2023.






14.
It is deposed that the delay in filing of the reference was occasioned by illness on the part of counsel for the client who allegedly was on sick-leave from 4
th
 October, 2023 to 17
th
 November, 2023.






15.
It is deposed that the application was filed without unreasonable or inordinate delay and that the delay is explained on the basis of illness on the part of counsel for the client.






16.
It is deposed that the client now wishes to file a reference against the taxation. It is alleged that the taxing officer failed to account for a sum of Kshs200,000/= that had allegedly been paid by the client to the advocate prior to the taxation.






17.
It is deposed that the taxing officer failed to give reasons for the taxation as she did and as such it is alleged that the taxation highly prejudiced the client.






18.
In response, it is deposed in the replying affidavit that the client only filed the application to forestall the execution process and to further delay the settlement of the matter. It is deposed that the advocate expected a higher award than what was granted in the taxation, but for the sake of bringing the matter to a close the advocate decided not to apply for a reference and hence only proceeded to apply for execution once the client took no steps towards payment and settlement of the taxed amount. It is deposed that the application is intended to frustrate the advocate from recovering lawful fees for services rendered.






19.
It is deposed that the client filed the application only upon being served with the notice of proclamation and attachment in execution.






20.
It is deposed that on 3
rd
 October, 2023, the date of the ruling on taxation, counsel for the client, Mr. Chumo, was present in court and no application for stay of execution, leave to file a reference, or any other application was made in court.






21.
It is further deposed that no efforts were made by the client to pay the amount awarded in taxation or file a reference and therefore, ultimately, the advocate took out the execution proceedings.






22.
It is deposed that no evidence has been availed in court to demonstrate that the client’s counsel was sick on or between 3
rd
 October, 2023 and 17
th
 November, 2023. It is deposed that counsel for the advocate was in constant contact with the counsel for the client and at no point was it mentioned or alleged that counsel for the client was unwell.






23.
It is deposed that the alleged sum of Kshs200,000/= paid to the advocate by the client was fees in a completely different matter, an anticorruption case, where the advocate defended the client and the same had nothing to do with the taxation herein which was in regard to an employment and labour relations cause between the client and her former employer, Maasai Mara University, being Nakuru ELRC No. E009 of 2020.






24.
It is deposed that the taxing officer gave her reasons for the taxation in the ruling and in any event no request has been made by the client to have such reasons clarified or restated altogether.






25.
In the supplementary affidavit it is deposed that the counsel in conduct of the matter, Mr. Chum Kibet, fell ill on 9
th
 October, 2023 and remained on sick-leave till 24
th
 October, 2023 and it is alleged that this explains why he was unable to file the reference within the time allowed. It is deposed that when the client contacted the said counsel sometimes in November, 2023 the time for filing a reference was long gone hence the instant application.








III. Submissions By Counsel


26.
Counsel for the client submits that the client intends to challenge the entire taxing as the same is deemed excessive with no reasons given by the taxing officer.






27.
In regard to whether the leave to file the intended reference out of time should be granted, counsel cited Paragraph 11 of the Advocates Remuneration Order, 2014 (ARO) which provides as follows –
11.
(1)
Should any party object to the decision of the taxing officer, he may within fourteen days after the decision give notice in writing to the taxing officer of the items of taxation to which he objects.
(2)
The taxing officer shall forthwith record and forward to the objector the reasons for his decision on those items and the objector may within fourteen days form the receipt of the reasons apply to a judge by chamber summons, which shall be served on all the parties concerned, setting out the grounds of his objection.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the judge upon any objection referred to such judge under subparagraph (2) may, with the leave of the judge but not otherwise, appeal to the Court of Appeal.
(4)
The High Court shall have power in its discretion by order to enlarge the time fixed by subparagraph(1) or subparagraph(2) for the taking of any step; application for such an order may be made by chamber summons upon giving to every other interested party not less than three clear days’ notice in writing or as the Court may direct, and may be so made notwithstanding that the time sought to be enlarged may have already expired.






28.
It is submitted that going by the above provisions this court has discretionary powers to enlarge time. It is further submitted that the same position is supported by Order 50 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 that provides as follows –
6.
Whereas a limited time has been fixed for doing any act or taking any proceedings under the Rules, or by summary notice or by order of the court, the court shall have power to enlarge such time upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require, and such enlargement may be ordered although the application for the same is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed.
Provided that the costs of any application to extend such time and of any order made thereon shall be borne by the parties making such application, unless the court orders otherwise.






29.
Counsel cited several decisions on the factors that the court should consider in determining how to exercise its discretion in an application such as this one. It is submitted that the court should consider the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the chances of the reference succeeding, and the degree of prejudice to either party if the application is granted.






30.
In regard to the length of delay counsel cited Sokoro Savings & Credit Co-operative Society Ltd V Mwamburi (2023) eKLR; Charles N. Ngugi V ASL Credit Limited (2022) eKLR; and George Kagima Kariuki & 2 Others V George M. Gichimu (2014) eKLR.






31.
On the reasons for the delay it is submitted that the illness on the part of the counsel for the client caused the delay and failure of the reference being filed in the time stipulated. It is submitted that in the circumstances the delay is excusable. Counsel cited Mativo J (now JA) in Njoroge V Kimani (2022) eKLR on what constitutes inexcusable or inordinate delay. In the same breath, counsel cited other decisions among them County Government of Tana River V Miller & Co Advocates (2021) eKLR; Florence Nyaguthii Muchemi V Attorney General & Another (2018) eKLR; and CMC Holdings Limited V Nzioki (2004) 1KLR 173 amongst other decisions on the same point.






32.
It is submitted that prima facie the intended reference has merits.






33.
On the issue of prejudice to the client if the application is allowed, it is submitted that with the high chances of success in the intended reference, the client shall be prejudiced if the application is denied and the execution allowed to proceed.






34.
Although the application does not expressly pray for stay of execution pending the filing, hearing, and determination of the reference, counsel for the client has submitted on stay of execution without specifying what the requested stay shall pend.






35.
Counsel for the advocate submitted that the medical records attached to the supplementary affidavit are categorical that contrary to the allegations made by the client, counsel for the client was unwell between 9
th
 and 24
th
 days of November, 2023. It is therefore submitted that for the period after the ruling on 3
rd
 October, 2023 to 9
th
 November, 2023 the concerned counsel was well and in good health. It is submitted that this fact demonstrates that the application by the client is made in bad faith, intended to frustrate the advocate in recovery of lawful legal fees for services rendered, aimed at delaying the conclusion of the matter, filed with the intention of misleading the court, and without merits.






36.
Counsel for the advocate cited Joseph Lekodi Teleu V Jonathan Paapai & Another (2022) eKLR in support of the argument that the application has no merits and urged the court to be persuaded by the said decision which dealt with similar issues as those in the instant application.






37.
It is submitted that after the ruling on the taxation the client did not issue a notice to the taxing officer on what items she was opposed or objecting to as required under Paragraph 11 of the ARO as reproduced elsewhere in this ruling. It is argued that the client has not even demonstrated in the application which items she intends to object to or challenge.






38.
It is vehemently argued that the application is a ploy to frustrate the advocate in the process of recovery of legal fees for services rendered and delay the settlement as long as it takes. It is argued that even if one assumed that the counsel for the client fell ill as alleged, which is however vehemently denied, the client has not demonstrated what efforts she made in following up the matter that in reality belongs to her not to her counsel. The court is urged to dismiss the application.








IV. Determination


39.
Upon careful and thorough reading of the application, the affidavits filed in support and in opposition thereto, the proceedings and the ruling by the taxing officer, and the written submissions by counsel for both parties, the following issues commend themselves for determination by the court -
a.
Should the client be granted leave to file a reference out of time?
b.
If (a) above is in the affirmative, should the applicant be granted stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of the intended reference?
c.
What are the appropriate orders on costs?






40.
The subject matter of this application is not as complex as the parties, and more so the client, wishes the court to believe. The applicable law is Paragraph 11 of the ARO cited verbatim in a proceeding part of this ruling. The procedure applicable is that once a taxing officer makes a ruling a party wishing to object to any of the items may issue a notice to the taxing officer within 14 days of the decision to that effect. Upon receipt of the notice the taxing officer may respond thereto giving or stating the reasons for the taxation of the objected items within 14 days of the notice. Upon receipt of the reasons from the taxing officer the objecting party may within 14 days file a reference before a judge by way of a chamber summons for the determination on the objected items.






41.
Paragraph 11(4) of the ARO donates to a judge the discretionary power to enlarge the foregoing timelines upon an application filed by way of chamber summons.






42.
The client missed on the deadlines set by the law cited above as a result of which she has filed the instant application for enlargement of the time to start the process of filing the intended reference. The reason advanced for the client not acting within the time allowed is that her counsel fell sick and failed to take the appropriate steps. That is the one and only reason given as to why the intended reference was not filed within the time allowed.






43.
The court finds and holds that the above reason advanced by the client lacks merits and it is only intended to mislead the court. Firstly, counsel for the client was present in court when the ruling on the taxation was delivered on 3
rd
 October, 2023. The medical records availed by the client for the alleged illness on the part of the said counsel, Mr. Chumo Kibet, indicate and confirm that he was attended to in the hospital between 9
th
 to 24
th
 November, 2023, over a month after the ruling. Secondly, there is no evidence or explanation whatsoever as to what steps the client took to instruct his counsel to commence the process of filing the reference. Thirdly, the said counsel has not filed any affidavit in support or in explanation of the delay in filing the reference and even the application to file the reference out of time. Fourthly, it is not explained or established that the said counsel was the only one in the law-firm who could handle the matter.






44.
The court finds and holds that the client only considered filing the application after the advocate took out the execution proceedings. The delay has not been explained and hence there is no reason for the same, the same is an afterthought intended to defeat justice and deny the advocate the fees as taxed for legal services rendered.






45.
Since there is no explanation given for the delay, the delay is held to be unreasonable and inordinate. The law sets deadlines for the purposes of fair and just adjudication of disputes. If parties were allowed to take actions at their pace, pleasure, and convenience, justice shall be delayed and denied.






46.
In the circumstances, the court finds no reason to grant the leave sought and consequently there are no grounds for granting stay of execution.






47.
Consequently, therefore, the application by the client is hereby dismissed with costs to the advocate. The costs of the application are hereby assessed at Kshs20,000/=. The client shall also meet the costs of the execution that was stayed.








V. Orders


48.
For all the foregoing reasons, the chamber summons application by the client dated 23
rd
 November, 2023 is hereby dismissed in its entirety with costs to the Advocate, which costs are hereby assessed at Kshs20,000/=. The client shall also meet the costs of the execution that was stayed.

Colin Stuart T/A Little Bay Investment Ltd


 


Applicant




and




Michael Yego


 


Respondent










Ruling










A. Parties And Representatives


1.
The Applicant, Colin Stuart T/A Little Bay Investment Ltd., is the owner of Shop No. 113 located at Digo Bazaar situated in Diani, being the suit premises herein (hereinafter the “Landlord”).






2.
The firm of Dagaye & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.






3.
The Respondent, Michael Yego, is the tenant and had rented space for business in the suit property (hereinafter the “Tenant”).






4.
The firm of Wonanio & Kabiaro Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.








B. Background Of The Dispute


5.
The Landlord moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and a Notice of Motion Application filed under a Certificate of Urgency both dated 14
th
 March, 2024 on a complaint that the Tenant has refused to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord despite being issued with a Termination Notice as per the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotel and Catering Establishments) Act.






6.
In response thereto, the Tenant filed a Replying Affidavit dated 10
th
 May 2024 and the Landlord correspondingly filed a Further Affidavit dated 5
th
 June 2024.






7.
The Tribunal directed that the Application dated 14
th
 March 2024 will be canvassed by way of written submissions and accordingly, the Landlord filed its Written Submissions dated 3
rd
 July 2024 while the Tenant filed his Written Submissions dated 10
th
 July 2024.








C. The Landlord’s Claim


9.
The Landlord submits that the nature of their tenancy is a controlled tenancy governed by a written agreement that commenced on or about February 2022 and was for a period of 5 years.






10.
The Landlord also submits that the tenancy between itself and the Tenant had been terminated vide a Notice to Terminate dated 8
th
 December 2023 (hereinafter “the Notice”) which was meant to take effect on 1
st
 March 2024 being two months after issuance of the Notice.






11.
It is the Landlord’s averment that the Notice was issued in accordance with the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotel and Catering Establishments) Act which provides for termination of a controlled tenancy.






12.
Ultimately, the Landlord urged the Tribunal to allow the Landlord’s Reference and Notice of Motion Application with costs to the Tenant.








D. The Tenant’s Claim


13.
The Tenant agrees that the Agreement between himself and the Landlord began in February 2022 for the period of five (5) years subject to renewal upon the expiration of the Agreement in 2026 thus the tenancy is a controlled tenancy.






14.
In light of the same, the Tenant avers that he had the firm believe that the tenancy was going to be a long-term business relationship and consequently invested heavily in the suit premises by erecting semi-permanent structures and conducting renovations on the let space with the full knowledge and consent of the Landlord.






15.
The Tenant also states that the suit premises, which is situated on the ground floor of the building, was subject to leakage arising from the unfinished state of the first floor which was still under construction and heavy rainfall caused water to leak through the pipes containing electric cables leading to destruction of the Tenant’s electronics. The Tenant avers that he incurred a cost of Kshs. 56,000.00 for repair and replacement of the electronics and Kshs. 28,000.00 for repair of the leaking roof.






16.
It is the Tenant’s averment that the Landlord instituted termination as a scape goat for compensating the Tenant for the aforementioned repairs.








E. List Of Issues For Determination


17.
Having given full consideration to the submissions filed by Counsels, the issue for determination is;
a.
Whether the Notice to Terminate dated 8
th
 December 2023 is valid and as such, whether the Tenant should hand over vacant possession to the Landlord?








F. Analysis & Determination


18.
The Submissions filed by the parties raises fundamental issues discussed herein below:
a)
Whether the Notice to Terminate dated 8
th
 December 2023 is valid and as such, whether the Tenant should hand over vacant possession to the Landlord?






19.
The 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
 Chapter 301 Laws of Kenya Act at section 4(2) provides that:
“
A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or to alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under, such a tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form.”






20.
Section 4(4) of Cap 301 further provides that:
“
No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party, as shall be specified therein.”






21.
In the case of Manaver N. Alibhai T/A Diani Boutique vs. South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited, Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was stated as follows;
“
The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in Form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”






22.
Section 4(5) of the Act states:
“
A tenancy notice shall not be effective for any of the purposes of this Act unless it specifies the grounds upon which the requesting party seeks the termination, alteration or reassessment concerned and requires the receiving party to notify the requesting party in writing, within one month after the date of receipt of the notice, whether or not he agrees to comply with the notice.”






23.
In this case the Landlords issued the tenant with the Notice on 8
th
 December 2023 which was to take effect from 1
st
 March 2024. Based on the above provision, the said notice was to take effect after more than two months which is as per the Provisions of CAP 301.






24.
Moreover, the Notice provided for the recipient to communicate whether or not they intend to comply with the Notice within one month after receipt thereof. This is in line with the provision encompassed in Section 4(5) of the Act which establishes the contents of an effective termination notice.






25.
The main question for determination that remains before this Tribunal is with regards to the substance of the said Notice.






26.
Section 7 of the Act provides for the grounds within which Landlord is allowed to issue a termination notice and at subsection (g) it provides as follows;
“
Where under section 4 of this Act served a notice of termination of a controlled tenancy on the tenant, the grounds on which the landlord seeks to terminate such tenancy may be such of the following grounds as are stated in the aforesaid notice—subject as hereinafter provided, that on the termination of the tenancy the landlord himself intends to occupy for a period of not less than one year the premises comprised in the tenancy for the purposes, or partly for the purposes, of a business to be carried on by him therein, or at his residence.”






27.
It is of equal importance to highlight the guidelines of opposing a termination notice as provided for in Section 6(1) of the Landlord & Tenant Act which states as follows:
“
A receiving party who wishes to oppose a tenancy notice, and who has notified the requesting party under section 4(5) of this Act that he does not agree to comply with the tenancy notice, may, before the date upon which such notice is to take effect, refer the matter to a Tribunal, whereupon such notice shall be of no effect until, and subject to, the determination of the reference by the Tribunal: Provided that a Tribunal may, for sufficient reason and on such conditions as it may think fit, permit such a reference notwithstanding that the receiving party has not complied with any of the requirements of this section.”






28.
Pursuant to the above provision, this Tribunal is of the view that the Tenant had sufficient time and means to oppose the Notice but he did not issue written communication that he did not agree to comply with the Notice within a month after receipt of the Notice. Neither did the Tenant refer the matter to a tribunal before the Notice was to take effect being 1
st
 March 2024.






29.
Inferring from the Tenant’s behavior as outlined hereinabove, the Tribunal is of the impression that the Tenant was willing to comply with the Notice as he did not follow due procedure of opposing the said Notice.






30.
Therefore, it remains unclear why the Tenant refuses and/or neglects to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord whilst he had opportunity to legally oppose the termination notice before the date it was meant to take effect.






31.
The Court opines that the Tenant is raising issues that are not pertinent to the matter at hand and whilst we hold high regard for the weight of the issues raised herein by the Tenant, the Tenant should have sought redress for the same in the manner prescribed by the law.






32.
Accordingly, this Tribunal is guided by the provisions of the law encapsulated in the Landlord and Tenant Act and is inclined to uphold the validity and legality of the Termination Notice dated 8
th
 December 2023 as it fully satisfies the requirements of a valid Termination Notice as per the aforesaid Act.








G. Orders


33.
The upshot is that the Landlords Reference and Notice of Motion Application dated 14
th
 March 2024 are dismissed with orders as follows:
a.
The Tenant is hereby ordered to hand over vacant possession to the Landlord within thirty (30) days after issuance of this Ruling;
b.
Upon the Tenant’s failure to comply, the Landlord is at liberty to break into the suit premises and take vacant possession of the same;
c.
O.C.S Ukunda Police Station to ensure compliance of these Orders; and
d.
Costs of the suit to be borne by the Tenant at Kshs. Ten Thousand Only (10,000.00)

IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF MUKHWABI RAGAMA AND KIRONDE MUKHWABI (DECEASED)








Ruling










1.
The application, for determination, is a chamber summons, dated 16
th
 April 2024. It is at the instance of Everline Natocho Juma, and it seeks that she and Peter Juma be subjected to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, with the Government Chemist, to clear all doubts as whether Peter Juma was her biological father.






2.
The said application was provoked by the outcome in Busia HC Misc. Applicati
on No. E052 of 2023
, where the administrator herein had obtained an order against the National Registration Bureau, to release documents relating to her national identity card registration, to confirm who was reflected, in those documents, as her parents. The administrator alleged that her parents are Peter Juma and Leonida Mugeni, something which she asserts not to be true. She asserts that her parents are Kironde Mukhwabi and Leonida Mugeni. She avers that both Kironde Mukhwabi and Leonida Mugeni are dead, but Peter Juma is alive, hence a DNA test could be conducted using samples from him. She avers that, should the order not be granted, she would suffer prejudice.






3.
There is a reply to the application, by Morris Oduor Were, the administrator. He avers that the said application is frivolous and an afterthought, prompted by confirmation from the State that the registration details in its possession confirm who the parents of the applicant are. He avers that the applicant has not denied that she was the author of the information in the possession of the office of the registrar of persons. He further avers that the applicant had alleged that Peter Juma was her uncle, and not her biological father. He asserts that conduct of the DNA test would be a wild goose chase, as it would not produce proof beyond doubt who her father is. He argues that if the court were to be persuaded that Peter Juma was not her biological father, then the court should cite her for perjury. He argues that 1 can only have 1 father for succession purposes, and that once she renounced the deceased as her father, in those registration documents, then she can only inherit from her officially recognised father, Peter Juma. He further argues that the application by the applicant, for revocation of grant, which is still pending, dated 28
th
 September 2023, revolves around the paternity of the applicant, and the applicant was bound to prove that Kironde Mukhwabi was her father.






4.
I have perused the summons for revocation of grant, dated 28
th
 September 2023, and noted that paternity of the applicant is at the heart of it. I have also perused the file in Busia HC. Misc. Applicati
on No. E052 of 2023
, which subpoenaed the records from the registrar of persons, with respect to the details the applicant used to obtain her national identification card, and noted that the same was prompted by the filing of the application, dated 28
th
 September 2023, and was intended to obtain information for use at the hearing of the said summons.






5.
I am persuaded that the application herein, dated 16
th
 April 2024, is premature. It should become necessary after hearing and disposal of the application, dated 28
th
 September 2023. A DNA test is intrusive (see In re Estate of SMM’I (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Mabeya, J)), particularly where the consent of a person who is not party ot the cause is not obtained (see RNC & & 2 others vs. SMG [2017] eKLR (Ougo, J)), In re Estate of MAP (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Ougo, J) and In re Estate of ZWN (Deceased) [2022] eKLR (J. Ngugi, J), and it should be adverted to as a last resort. See SWW vs. GMK (2012) eKLR (Majanja, J), RNC & & 2 others vs. SMG [2017] eKLR (Ougo, J and In re Estate of Peter Muraya Chege alias Muraya Chege (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Ndung’u, J). It should be considered only after the application, dated 28
th
 September 2023, is resolved in a manner which establishes that the applicant herein was not a child of Kironde Mukhwabi. A trial, on the correctness or genuineness of the information from the registrar of persons, should be conducted at the hearing of the revocation application. It should be in that hearing that the applicant has to establish the manner in which she is a child of Kironde Mukhwabi, and only upon strong evidence pointing to a close relationship between the mother of the claimant and the deceased, pointing a possibility that it could have led to a conception of the applicant. See In re Estate of JSM (Deceased) [2019] eKLR (Achode, J) and In re Estate of JMK (Deceased) [2021] eKLR (Achode, J). The best way forward, with respect to the application, dated 16
th
 April 2024, is to have it canvassed within the hearing of the revocation application, dated 28
th
 September 2023, where, depending on the evidence adduced, the court will assess whether or not to order a paternity test through DNA samples.






6.
There is one matter that I have noted, which is not raised in any of the applications, but which is of critical importance, and, I believe, it should be addressed at the hearing of the summons for revocation of the grant. The cause herein relates to an estate of 2 individuals, Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi. There cannot be a joint estate of 2 individuals, for succession purposes. There can only be 1 estate for each individual. There must be 1 for Mukhwabi Ragama, and another for Kironde Mukhwabi. It could be that the 2 owned the property jointly, or 1 was the father of the other, and upon the death of the father, it was presumed that the estate automatically devolved upon the son, hence the need to initiate 1 succession cause in respect thereof.






7.
Whatever the case, there can only be 1 succession cause in respect of the estate of 1 individual, and a single succession cause should not combine administration of estates of two or more individuals. There can only be 1 administration for each estate. See In Re Estate of James Kiarie Muiruri (Deceased) [2004] eKLR (Koome, J), In re Estate of Samuel Ngugi Mbugua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Musyoka, J) and In re Estate of Josphat Gatia Muchiri (Deceased) [2018] (Musyoka, J). In this case, therefore, 2 causes ought to have been initiated, 1 in the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, and the other in the estate of Kironde Mukhwabi. If Kironde Mukhwabi was a son of Mukhwabi Ragama, then succession to the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama should be handled first, so that what is due to the estate of Kironde Mukhwabi, from the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, is determined and devolved to that estate, to enable the descendants of Kironde Mukhwabi have access to that assets.






8.
I have seen a copy of the search certificate, in respect of the estate asset, Samia/Bujwanga/959, and I have noted that the property was registered in the names of 3 individuals, including Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi, with each holding a 1/3 share. That meant that the 3 held the property in tenancy in common, with each of the co-owners having a distinct 1/3 share. See In re Estate of John Ngumba Njoroge (Deceased) [2018] eKLR (J. Ngugi, J) and In re Estate of Philip Nguli Kivulu (Deceased) [2021] eKLR (Odunga, J). Upon demise of Mukhwabi Ragama and Kironde Mukhwabi, their estates were entitled to a 1/3 share each. Succession ought to have been sought separately for each 1/3 share. The parties will have to resolve the issue, by deciding on the way forward, for as it is, the cause herein is not tenable. Succession to 2 separate estates cannot be litigated in 1 succession cause. See In re Estate of Godfrey Kituku (Deceased) & Regina Mukui Ndaka (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Chitembwe, J) and In re Estate of Rolf Rainer Schmid (Deceased) [2017] eKLR (Musyoka, J). The parties will have to decide on whether this cause should relate to the estate of Mukhwabi Ragama, or that of Kironde Mukhwabi, but not both.






9.
The final order shall be that the application dated 16
th
 April 2024, shall not be determined in this ruling, instead it shall be canvassed simultaneously with the summons for revocation of grant, dated 28
th

nd
 May 2024 stated above.






8.
On 24
th

At a court hearing on 3
rd
 June 2024, the court issued orders that both applications in this matter be canvassed together by way of written submissions and the date issued for inter-partes hearing for the application dated 22
nd
 May 2024 was vacated.






10.
The tenant opposes the landlord’s application vide a replying affidavit dated 14
th
 June 2024 in which he deposes as follows; -
i.
That the landlord indeed issued a notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 which was to take effect on 15
th
 May 2024.
ii.
That a day after the issuance of the said notice, the tenant wrote to the landlord asking to be given a window to clear the said arrears as the tenant had found promising clients who were ready and willing to buy furniture and aid in easing the rent burden.

That the landlord despite the request above proceeded to close down the suit premises.
iv.
That the landlord and/or their agents informed the tenant that they no longer needed the said rent and they wanted the tenant out of the suit premises.

That the tenant acknowledges the rent arrears owed to the landlord.
vi.
That the tenant owns goods whose worth is above KES. 2,500,000 still being held within the suit premises.
vii.
That the tenant had plans to pay all outstanding debts however the same was thwarted by the illegal actions of the landlord.






11.
The landlord filed a further affidavit dated 4
th
 July 2024 in which it deposes that the allegations that he has goods worth KES. 2,500,000 within the suit premises is baseless as the tenant has not submitted any evidence to prove the said allegation.






12.
The landlord further deposes that at no time has the landlord ever informed the tenant that it no longer needed to be paid the rent or rent arrears owing from the tenant and that the tenant has failed to pay his rent and rent arrears.






13.
Both parties complied by filing their written submissions with the tenant filing his dated 14
th
 June 2024 and the landlord filling its submissions dated 4
th
 July 2024. We shall consider both submissions as we deal with the issues for determination.








B. Issues for determination


14.
The following are the issues for determination.
a.
Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 is valid and lawful.
b.
Whether the tenant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 14
th
 May 2024
c.
Whether the landlord is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 22
nd
 May 2024.
d.
Who shall bear the costs of both applications?






Issue (a) Whether the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 is valid and lawful.


15.
The landlord herein issued the tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 which was due to take effect on 15
th
 May 2024.






16.
The tenant in his replying affidavit dated 14
th
 June 2024 deposes that the said notice is illegal because the tenant was to vacate the premises after the lapse of 1 month which he states to be the 15
th
 May 2024.






17.
In the case of Manaver N Alibhai t/a Diani Boutique – vs- South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was held as follows: -
“
The Act lays down clearly in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated and no term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of any such tenancy shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”






18.
We have perused the notice to terminate tenancy subject matter herein and note that the same is dated 14
th
 March 2024 and was expressed to take effect on 15
th
 May 2024, which constitutes a period 2 months as required by Cap 301 Laws of Kenya. In addition, we find that the notice is in the prescribed form according to Cap 301 Laws of Kenya.






19.
Consequently, we find that the said notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 is lawful and valid.








Issue (b) Whether the tenant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 14
th
 May 2024.


20.
The tenant approached this tribunal seeking for restraining orders against the landlord from evicting or interfering with his occupation of the suit premises, that the landlord restores the tenant’s access to the suit premises and that the landlord be compelled to accept rent at the rate of KES. 50,000 per month or in the alternative, the tenant be allowed to pay the said rent to the tribunal.






21.
The tenant in his written submissions states that the landlord acted illegally by closing the premises a day after issuing the termination notice and that the mandatory period of 2 months had not lapsed.






22.
The landlord on the other hand states in its written submissions that it is not true that it had locked the suit premises as alleged and that the landlord believes that the tenant is the one who locked up the suit premises perhaps to avoid being followed up to pay the outstanding rent arrears. The landlord also deposes the same in its replying affidavit.






23.
We note that the court issued interim orders among other orders that the landlord restores the tenant’s access and control of the suit premises. During the hearings and mentions in this matter, the tenant did not at any time mention that the said orders had not been complied with. The tenant has also not presented any evidence to show that the said premises had been locked by the landlord.






24.
The tenant has also not denied that he owes the landlord the claimed rent arrears of KES. 1,669,500 as deposed in the landlord’s supporting affidavit dated 22
nd
 May 2024.






25.
In the case of Samuel Kipkori Ngeno and Another – vs- Local Authorities Pension Trust (Registered Trustees) & Another (2013) eKLR at paragraphs 
9
 and 
12
, the court held as follows: -
“


9.
A tenant’s first and main obligation is to pay rent as and when it becomes due for the landlord has the right to an income from his investment. Why would a tenant allow himself to fall into such huge arrears of rent”?






“12.
The temporary injunction sought in the present application is an equitable remedy at the court’s discretion. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands. A tenant who is in huge arrears of rent is underserving of the court’s discretion. The court cannot be refuge of a tenant who fails to meet his principal obligation of paying rent as and when it becomes due”.








26.
Despite the alleged closure of the suit premises by the landlord, the foregoing case provides sufficient guidance in directing that the tenant pays rent arrears owed to the landlord and in default the court shall direct that the landlord be at liberty to use lawful means to recover the same.






27.
Based on the establishment that the notice to terminate tenancy is legal, the tribunal is not able to grant orders compelling the landlord to accept rent from the tenant.






28.
Consequently, the tribunal shall order that the application dated 14
th
 May 2024 be dismissed with costs to the landlord/respondent.








Issue (c) Whether the landlord is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 22
nd
 May 2024.


29.
The landlord filed the application dated 22
nd
 May 2024 seeking for orders that the tribunal vacates orders made on 16
th
 May 2024, that the landlord be allowed to break into the suit premises for purposes of taking an inventory of the property/items therein and thereafter keep such property in safe custody pending hearing and determination of the matter and that the court issue orders of compensation to the landlord for loss and damage due to the tenant’s reference.






30.
The landlord in his written submissions has directed the court to paragraph 16 of its replying affidavit where the landlord states as follows; -
“
… by email dated 27th March 2024, the tenant/applicant effectively notified the landlord/respondent that the tenant/applicant would be moving out of the demised premises, thereby signalling that the tenant/applicant had agreed to comply with the said Tenancy Notice dated 14th March 2024. Particularly, the tenant/applicant stated thus:
“… our clients have turned up with high value business propositions that can allow us to settle the arrears in a couple of months even as we prepare to move out … Meanwhile the CEO/Manager Concept Mahogany will furnish you with a payment plan to demonstrate our commitment to clear the arrears and move on …”






31.
We agree with the landlord in that the statement above is an indication that the tenant had agreed to comply with the said termination notice from the onset.






32.
Upon perusal of the documents filed in this matter, there is no evidence of the proposed rent arrears payment plan by the tenant to show his willingness to pay the said rent arrears.






33.
Furthermore, the tenant has not filed any reference under Section 6 of Cap 301, Laws of Kenya to oppose the notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024.






34.
Section 6 of the Act states;
“
A receiving party who wishes to oppose a tenancy notice, and who has notified the requesting party under section 4(5) of this Act that he does not agree to comply with the tenancy notice, may, before the date upon which such notice is to take effect, refer the matter to a Tribunal, whereupon such notice shall be of no effect until, and subject to, the determination of the reference by the Tribunal”






35.
Based on the above analysis, the court finds that the landlord is deserving of the orders sought in the application dated 22
nd
 May 2024 and this court shall vacate the orders issued on 16
th
 May 2024.








Issue (d) Who shall bear the costs of both applications?


36.
As regards costs, the same are in the Tribunal’s discretion under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall award costs to the landlord/respondent.










C. Orders


37.
Given the above analysis, the final orders which commend to us are;
a.
The Notice to terminate tenancy dated 14
th
 March 2024 is hereby upheld and the tenant’s tenancy in respect to the suit premises is hereby terminated.
b.
The application dated 14
th
 May 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs to the landlord/respondent.
c.
The reference dated 14
th
 May 2024 is settled in terms.
d.
The landlord’s application dated 22
nd
 May 2024 is hereby allowed in terms of prayer 2.
e.
The tenant shall vacate the suit premises within the next 21 days and in default shall be forcibly evicted therefrom by a Licensed Auctioneer who shall be provided with security by the OCS Kisumu Central Police Station.
f.
The tenant is liable to pay rent arrears owing to the landlord up to and including the date of such vacation or eviction and in default, the landlord is at liberty to use all lawful means to recover rent arrears against the tenant.
g.
The tenant shall pay costs of Kshs.50,000/- to the landlord.




It is so ordered.

Ruling










A. Parties And Representatives


1.
The Applicant, Granada Energy Limited, has rented space for purposes of operating a petrol station business (“the Tenant”) erected on Plot No. 27 situated in Old Town Mavoko within Machakos (the “suit property”).






2.
The firm of B.V. Francis & Associates Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.






3.
The Respondent, Felista Kanini Maundu, is the Landlady and owner of the suit property who rented out the suit property to the Tenant (the “Landlady”).






4.
The firm of Onwong’a Nyakeriga & Co. Advocates represents the Landlady in this matter.








B. The Dispute Background


5.
Vide a Reference dated 27
th
 May 2024 and an Application evenly dated, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking to raise an objection to the Landlady’s Notice to Vacate dated 13
th
 May 2024.






6.
On 28
th
 May 2024, the Tribunal in consideration of the Tenant’s Application, certified the matter as urgent and granted restraining orders against the Landlady from interfering with the Tenant’s quiet possession of the suit property pending hearing. The OCS Mavoko Police Station was ordered to ensure compliance.






7.
Subsequently, the Tenant filed an Application for review on the orders dated 28
th
 May 2024 on the grounds that the orders be addressed to the OCS Athi-river police station instead of OCS Mavoko police station as previously ordered. Consequently, on 5
th
 June 2024, the Tribunal granted the orders sought by the Tenant thereby directing the OCS Athi River Police Station to ensure compliance.






8.
Following this, the Landlady filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 10
th
 June 2024 on the grounds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine this suit.






9.
During the hearing on 8
th
 July 2024 in the presence of the Counsels for both parties, the Tribunal directed parties to file their submissions. On 25
th
 July 2024, the Tenant confirmed to this Tribunal that parties have complied and filed their submissions. Therefore, it is in respect of the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 27
th
 May 2024 that this matter comes for ruling.








C. Tenant’s Claim


10.
The Tenant avers that the Landlady’s termination notice dated 13
th
 May 2024 is defective as it purports to issue a 16 days’ notice instead of a 30 days’ notice in accordance to the Lease Agreement dated 1
st
 August 2023 between the Tenant and the Landlady.






11.
The Tenant also avers that it has always been remitting rent within reasonable period to the Landlady’s bank account. As such, the Tenant denies owing any rent arrears. The Tenant avers that upon execution of the Agreement, the Tenant duly paid to the Landlady the sum of Kshs. 780,000/= as rent for a period of 6 months in which it has annexed bank payment receipt as evidence. Additionally, the Tenant avers in paragraph 6 of its Supporting Affidavit that it made further payment of Kshs. 800,000/= to the Landlady as rent for a further 6 months as allegedly agreed to which it adduced proof of bank receipt.






12.
In response to the Landlady’s Replying Affidavit dated 10
th
 June 2024, the Tenant avers under paragraph 9 of its Further Affidavit that the allegations for a refund of Kshs. 250,000/= by the Landlady is not true. The Tenant depones that the said amounts paid by the Landlady was in partial satisfaction of a claim for Kshs. 300,000/= which loss was occasioned by the Landlady’s son as a result of an offence of stealing by servant which was reported to the Police and an OB Number issued.






13.
The Tenant contends that the Landlady is in contempt of the orders dated 28
th
 May 2024. The Tenant avers that despite proper service of the Court Orders, the Landlady has occasioned damage of the Tenant’s property as evidenced in the photographs attached therewith.






14.
Further, the Tenant avers that the Landlady has occasioned loss of business and hindered business operations through the illegal actions of the Landlady to rent out the suit property to a third party during the existence a binding Agreement between the parties.








D. Landlady’s Claim


15.
In response, the Landlady alleges that despite the Tenant being in breach of the Agreement her pleas have gone unheard. Under paragraph 9 of the Respondent’s Replying Affidavit, the Landlady disputes that she has neither held conversation with the Tenant nor made arrangements to accept any partial rent payment as alleged by the Tenant.






16.
The Landlady alleges that it is the Tenant who initiated request for refund of the balance of rent and to find another tenant. To salvage the suit property from wasting away, the Landlady avers that she issued a notice to the Tenant to vacate.






17.
The Landlady avers that upon the alleged refund of Kshs. 250,000/= to the Tenant on 30
th
 May 2024, the Tenant handed possession to the Landlady and willingly vacated the suit property. As a result, the Landlady depones that the tenancy relationship does not exist.






18.
The Landlady also avers that she has incurred damages of Kshs. 64,500/= as cost of repair as evidenced in the attachment to her replying affidavit.








E. Issues For Determination


19.
Upon perusal, I find the following to be the main issues for determination:
i.
Whether there exists any tenancy relationship between the Landlord and the Tenant;
ii.
Whether the termination notice dated 13
th
 May 2024 is enforceable; and
iii.
Whether the Tenant is entitled to the reliefs sought.








F. Analysis And Findings


Whether there exists any tenancy relationship between the Landlord and the Tenant


20.
The Landlord and Tenant (Sops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (“the Act”) confers power to this Honourable Tribunal to deal with the issue on jurisdiction which the Landlady has raised in her Preliminary Objection and also as part of her Grounds of Opposition. Section 12 of the Act states that:
(1)
A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power—
(a)
to determine whether or not any tenancy is a controlled tenancy;






21.
Further, Section 2 of the Act, defines a controlled tenancy as;
tenancy of a shop, hotel or catering establishment-
b)
Which has not been reduced into writing; or
c)
Which has been reduced into writing and which-
i.
Is for a period not exceeding five years; or
ii.
Contains provision for termination, otherwise than for breach of covenant, within five years from the commencement thereof; or
iii.
Relates to premises of a class specified under subsection 2 of this section.
Provided that no tenancy to which the Government, the Community or a local authority is a party, whether as landlord or as tenant, shall be a controlled tenancy;






23.
In the instant case, it is not in dispute that parties entered into a Lease Agreement dated 1
st
 August 2023 (“the Agreement”) to lease the suit property for a term of 1 year 11 months effective 1
st
 August 2023 until 1
st
 July 2025 at a monthly rent of Kshs. 130,000/=. Subsequently, the Tenant took vacant possession of the suit property upon payment of Kshs. 780,000/= to the Landlady as rent for the initial 6 months upfront which is in consonance with the agreed terms. The Landlady under paragraph 7 of her Replying Affidavit has acknowledged receipt of the said amounts to which the Tenant has adduced a copy of the bank receipt in support of its claim.






24.
Based on the existence of a duly executed written Agreement, I am satisfied that the tenancy relationship between the parties herein culminate to a controlled tenancy which this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and make orders. Therefore, I am convinced that the claims as raised by the Landlady in her Preliminary Objection as well as the Grounds of Opposition are without basis as the dispute herein relates to issues which arose during, or are akin to, a controlled tenancy.








Whether the termination notice dated 13
th
 May 2024 is enforceable


25.
Section 4 of the Act provides as follows:
“
A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy or to alter to the detriment of the tenant any term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under such a tenancy shall give notice in that behalf in the prescribed form”.






26.
In the case of Manaver N. Alibhai T/A Diani Boutique vs. South Coast Fitness & Sports Centre Limited, Civil Appeal No. 203 of 1994 it was stated as follows;
“
The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought.”






27.
Having established that the tenancy in this case relates to a controlled tenancy, the Landlady is obliged to issue a valid termination notice to the Tenant in the prescribed from failure to which the notice shall not be enforceable.






28.
In the circumstances, the Landlady issued the Tenant with a Notice to Vacate vide a letter dated 13
th
 May 2024 which was to take effect on the 31
st
 May 2024 upon which the Tenant was required to give vacant possession to the Landlady.






29.
The Agreement under clause 10 requires the Landlady to issue a 30 days’ written notice to the Tenant on condition that there has to be a failure on the part of the Tenant to rectify the breach within 60 days upon receipt of a written notice from the Landlady. In the absence of a 60 days’ notice to the Tenant to rectify the breach and a further 30 days as agreed, the Landlady’s notice is not in the correct form as it is neither within the prescribed statutory period nor within the period as agreed in the Agreement.






30.
Taking turn on the substantive issue, the Landlady seeks vacant possession of the suit property on the grounds of breach of clause 3(i) which the Tenant is obliged under the Agreement to make upfront payment of the initial 6 months’ rent being Kshs. 780,000/=. From the facts, the Landlady has not adduced any evidence to buttress her claim for non-payment. Conversely, the Tenant has adduced a copy of the bank receipt as proof of payment of the amounts under clause 3(i) to which the Landlady has admitted under paragraph 7 of her Replying Affidavit.








Whether the Tenant is entitled to the reliefs sought.


31.
Section 12 of the Act authorizes this Honourable Tribunal to make various orders which, inter alia, include:
(e)
to make orders, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, for the recovery of possession and for the payment of arrears of rent and mesne profits, which orders may be applicable to any person, whether or not he is a tenant, being at any material time in occupation of the premises comprised in a controlled tenancy;
(l)
to award compensation for any loss incurred by a tenant on termination of a controlled tenancy in respect of goodwill, and improvements carried out by the tenant with the landlord’s consent”






32.
Having determined that the Landlady’s Notice to Vacate is invalid thus unlawful, the Tenant is entitled to compensation for loss incurred upon the unlawful termination of the controlled tenancy by the Landlady. Notably, the Tenant has merely quoted as costs the value of the signages destroyed. However, there is no proof either payment receipt or document to show the value of the property.






33.
Further, the Tenant claims reimbursement of Kshs. 260,000/= as rent paid in upfront for the period in which the Tenant was not in occupation the suit property. It is noteworthy to consider upon lapse of the initial 6 months period on 31
st
 January 2024, the Tenant paid in advance Kshs. 800,000/= to the Landlady’s account and adduced a copy of the payment receipt. Accordingly, the Landlady is only entitled to the rent from 1
st
 February 2024 until 30
th
 May 2024 in which the Tenant was in occupation of the suit property being Kshs. 520,000/= and the balance of Kshs. 280,000/= be refunded since the Tenant is no longer in occupation of the suit property.






34.
On the issue of repairs, the Landlady has adduced an invoice in the sum of Kshs. 64,500/= as proof of the damages incurred during the subsistence of the tenancy. Notably, the Tenant has neither denied nor disputed any of the amounts in the Landlady’s invoice. Further, on the issue of contempt, the Tribunal takes note that the Tenant has vacated the suit property and is no longer in occupation thus the Tribunal cannot purport to act in vain since the orders are overtaken by events.










G. Orders


35.
In the upshot, the Tenant’s Reference and Application dated 27
th
 May 2024 is hereby allowed in the following terms:
i.
Landlady to offset the amounts as costs for repair as Kshs. 64,500/= from the balance of Kshs. 280,000.00;
ii.
Landlady to refund to the Tenant within 30 days from the date hereof rent balance of Kshs. 215,500.00; and
iii.
Each party shall bear its own costs.

Judgment










1.
The Applicants have filed Originating Summons dated 29 January 2024, seeking the following orders:
i.
That the consent of the biological parents of Baby EH  be dispensed with since the child was abandoned shortly after birth;
ii.
That the Applicants herein be and are hereby authorised to adopt Baby EH  and the child shall be called I.C.A;
iii.
That the Court be pleased to appoint K. M. K. And E.K.O.M as the legal guardians for EH  upon granting the adoption order;
iv.
That the Registrar General be ordered to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register in respect of Baby EH ;
v.
That EH  be considered a Kenyan citizen;
vi.
That the court be pleased to make any further orders it deems necessary.






2.
The Summons is accompanied by Statement in Support of the Application for an Adoption Order, Affidavit in Support of the Application and annextures thereto.






3.
The matter was canvassed by way of viva voce evidence on the virtual platform on 11 July 2024.






The Child


4.
It is estimated that the child (male) was born on 21st February 2019. The child was abandoned by his mother at the Kenyatta National Hospital on 21 March 2019. The matter was reported to the Kenyatta Police Post vide OB No. 19/XX/X/2019.The child was admitted at the Kenyatta National Hospital from 21 March 2019 to 17 May 2019, before he was moved to the Hope House Babies Home. The child was committed to the Home by the Children’s Court at Nairobi on 3 July 2019.






5.
The court had the opportunity to interact with the child at the hearing. He appeared to be healthy and happy, seated on the 1st Applicant’s lap. He identified the Applicants as “mom” and ‘Dad”. The court observed that the child had bonded well with the Applicants.






6.
The child was declared free for adoption by the KKPI Adoption Society, a registered Adoption Agency, vide the annexed Certificate serial number 847. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met.








The Applicants


7.
The Applicants are Kenyan citizens, residing in Nairobi West, Nairobi County. They are a married couple, having celebrated their marriage August 2008. They do not have any other children.






8.
The 1st Applicant, aged 47 years old, is an IT specialist. The 2nd Applicant is also 47 years old and is an Optometrist. They indicated that due to challenges in having their own biological children, they opted to pursue adoption. The child was placed with them on 20 April 2021. They confirmed that they have bonded with him and he is part of their family.






9.
The Applicants confirmed that they fully understood the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.








The Adoption Application


10.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed. The duty of this Court is to analyse the material before it to determine whether the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.






11.
The Applicants states that they are practising Christians and intend to raise the child in the Christian faith. They attend the International Christian Centre, Nairobi West campus. The Applicants have annexed copies of bank statements, and pay slips as proof of their financial stability.






12.
The Applicants have annexed copies of clearance certificates from the Kenya Police Service as proof that they have no criminal record. They have provided Recommendations letters as well in proof of their character and good standing.






13.
The Applicants presented K. M. K. And E.K.O.M as proposed legal guardians for the child. The said legal guardians, a married couple, signed a consent dated 29 January 2024 indicating their willingness to step in and care for the child in the event the Applicants are unable to provide for the child.






14.
From the material availed, I am satisfied that the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.








Analysis and Determination


15.
Article 14 (4) of 
The Constitution
 provides as follows:
A child found in Kenya who is, or appears to be, less than 8 years of age, and whose nationality and parents are not know, is presumes to be a citizen by birth.






16.
The child was abandoned within the Republic of Kenya a few days after he was born. I, therefore, declare that the child is a citizen of Kenya by birth.






17.
The child was abandoned and all efforts by the police to trace the child’s parents/relatives have borne no fruit. The letter dated 11 November 2019 from Kenyatta Police Post, Nairobi indicates that efforts to trace the child’s parents have yielded no positive results. In the circumstances, there exists no known person from whom consent for this adoption can be sought and/or obtained. I, therefore, waive this requirement in line with section 185 (4)(b) of the 
Children Act
, Cap 141 of the Laws of Kenya.






18.
In deciding any matter involving a child, the court is obligated to give priority to the best interest of the child. Section 8 of the 
Children Act
 provides:
1.
In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies –
a.
The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;
b.
The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule;
2.
All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to:-
a.
Safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;
b.
Conserve and promote the welfare of the child; and
c.
Secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in the public interest.






19.
This child who was abandoned soon after birth faced an uncertain future in the children’s homes and other similar institutions. This adoption, therefore, allows the child the opportunity to be raised in a stable and loving home environment.






20.
I have considered the Reports filed by the Adoption Agency, the Guardian ad litem, the Director of Children Services, all of which were positive and recommended the adoption. It is, therefore, my view that the adoption does serve the best interests of the child.






21.
Accordingly, I allow the Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicants, A.A. and C.C.C, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby EH ;
ii.
Upon adoption, the child shall be renamed as I.C.A;
iii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iv.
K. M. K. And E.K.O.M are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,
v.
The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;
vi.
That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;

IN THE MATTER OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT, CAP 248 OF THE LAWS OF KENYA


AND


IN THE MATTER OF M.C.M (PERSON SUFFERING FROM MENTAL DISABILITY)






In the matter of




MCM


 


Subject




and




KNM


 


Petitioner










Judgment










1.
The Petition before the Court was brought by KNM, being the sister to the subject, MCM. MCM is a 39-year-old man residing in Donholm with his sister, the Petitioner. The Petition which is brought under sections 26 (1), 27 and 27 of the 
Mental Health Act
, is supported by an Affidavit sworn by the Petitioner, as well as annextures thereto. In the Affidavit, the Petitioner depones that she is the primary care giver to MCM, who suffers from intellectual and convulsive disorder, rendering him incapable of managing his affairs.






2.
At the hearing of the Petition, the Petitioner testified that there is no other living sibling or parent to care for MCM. It was her testimony that MCM suffers from convulsions and is forgetful. The convulsions began in 2017 after their mother passed on. The subject has been treated at Mathare National Teaching and Referral Hospital, where he was diagnosed with Intellectual Disability. The subject was examined by Dr. Kamunge and a report dated 8th August 2022 was submitted to the National Council of Persons with Disability (Annexture KNM1).






3.
Additionally, the Petitioner presented a letter dated 8th August 2022 from Dr. Kamunge to the Standard Chartered Bank informing the Bank of the subject’s condition. The Petitioner also presented a Medical Assessment Report for Persons with Disability from the Ministry of Health.






4.
I had an opportunity to speak to the Subject and I am persuaded that this Petition is properly before the Court.






5.
Section 26 of the said Act states that:
1)
The court may make orders—
(a)
for the management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder; and
(b)
for the guardianship of any person suffering from mental disorder by any near relative or by any other suitable person.
(2)
Where there is no known relative or other suitable person, the court may order that the Public Trustee be appointed manager of the estate and guardian of any such person.
(3)
Whereupon inquiry it is found that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder to such an extent as to be incapable of managing his affairs, but that he is capable of managing himself and is not dangerous to himself or to others or likely to act in a manner offensive to public decency, the court may make such orders as it may think fit for the management of the estate of such person, including proper provision for his maintenance and for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for maintenance, but need not, in such case, make any order as to the custody of the person suffering from mental disorder






6.
I have also considered all the material placed before me. It is apparent that the subject suffers from a mental disorder and that he is incapable of managing his own affairs, although he is not dangerous to himself.






7.
The definition in Section 2 of the Act provides that:
“
A person suffering from mental disorder” means a person who has been found to be suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol or substance abuse.”






8.
In the circumstances, the court makes a finding that the subject is a person suffering from a mental disorder within the definition of the 
Mental Health Act
 and hereby appoints the Petitioner as the subject’s guardian. Additionally, the court appoints the said Petitioner as general manager of the estate of the subject. For the avoidance of doubt, such manager’s general powers will not include the power of alienation, sale or transfer of the subject’s immovable assets but will include all the powers necessary for the management of such and other assets, and to plead and prosecute and/or defend any action brought by or against the subject in respect of any of the assets forming part of his estate.

Between




John Kingori Andrew Macharia


 


Landlord




and




Peter Munuria Kioi


 


Tenant










Ruling










A. Parties And Their Representatives


1.
The Applicant, John Kingori Andre Macharia, is the lawful owner of the suit premises erected on Plot No. Aguthi/Gatitu 2070 situate within Nyeri County in the Republic of Kenya.






2.
The Firm of Maina Kimumu & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.






3.
The Respondent, Peter Munuria Kioi, rented the suit premises and hence is a lawful tenant thereto.






4.
The Firm of Karweru & Company Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.








B. Dispute Background


5.
On 6
th
 October 2024, Landlord served the Tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy dated 4
th
 October 2024 on the basis that the Tenant was in rent arrears amounting to KShs. 68,000.00. However, the Tenant did not object to the said notice and failed to vacate the suit premises on the effective date of the notice, 1
st
 January 2024.






6.
Consequently, the Landlord moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and Notice of Motion dated 10
th
 January 2024 seeking Orders certifying the matter as urgent, terminating the tenancy between him and the Tenant and consequently issue an eviction order against the Tenant, and break in orders should the Tenant restrain the Landlord from accessing the suit premises. Further, the Landlord prayed that the OCS Ruring’u Police Station to enforce the Orders of this Tribunal in this matter.






7.
The Tribunal through an Order dated 11
th
 January 2024 certified the matter as urgent and set the matter for hearing on 8
th
 February 2024 and further directed the Landlord to file an Affidavit of Service as proof of service, which the Landlord did on 9
th
 January 2024.






8.
On 8
th
 February 2024, this Court allowed the Landlord’s Application dated 10
th
 January 2024 terminating the Tenancy between Landlord and the Tenant herein in the absence of the Tenant and marked the matter as settled.






9.
The Tenant subsequently filed an Application under a Certificate of Urgency dated 27
th
 February 2024 seeking to have the Orders of this Court dated 8
th
 February 2024 terminating the Tenancy between him and the Landlord and any other consequential orders thereto stayed, set aside or vacated.






10.
It is the Tenant’s Application dated 27
th
 February 2024 that is the subject of this Ruling.








C. The Tenant’s Case


11.
The Tenant’s Application is based on the grounds that he was not served with the notice of termination as alleged by the Landlord and hence, the said notice is ineffective.






12.
Further, the Tenant in his submissions dated 12
th
 July 2024, submits that he was not served with the Application dated 10
th
 January 2024 and that the Orders of 8
th
 February 2024 were issued in his absentia thereby denying him an opportunity to participate in the proceedings.






13.
The Tenant therefore prays that this Court stays, sets aside and vacates its Orders dated 8
th
 February 2024 and direct the Landlord to allow his access to the suit premises.








D. The Respondents’ Case


14.
In his replying affidavit dated 15
th
 May 2024, the Landlord avers that the Tenant was duly served with both the notice to terminate the Tenancy dated 4
th
 October 2023 and the Reference and Application dated 10
th
 January 2024, but deliberately failed to respond to the said notice of termination and to enter appearance to defend the matter.






15.
The Tenant avers that following the Orders of this Court dated 8
th
 February 2024, the Tenant vacated the premises on his own volition and took all his items through his authorized agents.






16.
It is the Landlord’s case therefore that this Tribunal lacks the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter since the tenancy has already determined and the suit premises let to another person currently running a fish eatery business.








E. Issues For Determination


17.
I have given full consideration to the Tenant’s Notice of Motion Application dated 27
th
 February 2024 and Respondents’ Replying Affidavit dated 15
th
 May 2024. It is my considered opinion that the sole issue that falls for determination is:
Whether this Tribunal should stay, review and/or suspend the enforcement and/or execution of the Orders issued delivered on 8
th
 February 2024 and all consequential processes arising therefrom.








F. Analysis And Determination


18.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Cap 301 Laws of Kenya, this Court is clothed with the requisite jurisdiction to entertain an Application to stay, set aside or vacate its own Orders. It states;
A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power—
i.
to vary or rescind any order made by the Tribunal under the provisions of this Act;






19.
The power to review is also provided for under Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 Cap 21 which provides that: -
“
Any person who considers himself aggrieved—
a.
by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed by this Act, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
b.
by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed by this Act, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order, and the court may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.”






20.
Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides for the threshold to be met in an application for review. It provides that: -
“


1.
(1)
Any person considering himself aggrieved—
a.
by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
b.
by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”








21.
In elaborating Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 Cap 21 and Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 the Court in Republic v Public Procurement
Administrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] eKLR held that: -
“
Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”






22.
Similarly, in 
Republic v Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal Ex parte Apollo Mboya [2019] eKLR High Court of Kenya Nairobi Judicial Review Division Misc. Application No. 317 of 2018
 Mativo J culled out the following principles from a number of authorities including: -
i.
……………….
ii.
The expression ""any other sufficient reason"" appearing in Order 45 Rule 1 has to be interpreted in the light of other specified grounds.






23.
I am well aware that the power to review is discretionary. I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pancras T. Swai v Kenya Breweries Limited [2014] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
Order 44 rule 1 (now Order 45 rule 1 in the 2010 Civil Procedure Rules) gave the trial Court discretionary power to allow review on the three limps therein stated or “for any sufficient reason...”






24.
I have considered all materials placed before this Court and note that in deed, the Orders of the Court dated 8
th
 February 2024 were issued in the absence of the Tenant. However, I note that the Landlord filed a return of service being proof that service was effected on the Tenant.






25.
Further, I note that despite the Landlord indicates that the Tenant vacated and he has already let the suit premises to someone else, thereby terminating the tenancy between the parties herein. This, the Tenant has not denied. In the circumstances, this Tribunal lacks the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.








G. Determination


26.
In the upshot, the Tenant’s Application and reference dated 27
th
 February 2024 is hereby dismissed. Each party to bear their own costs.

          August 29, 2024
        






Between




Anytime Limited


 


Tenant




and




Mohib Teherali Abdul Hussein t/a Associated Glass and Hardware


 


Landlord










Ruling










A. Parties And Their Representatives


1.
The Applicant, Anytime Limited, is a proprietor of a wholesale and distribution business in a Go-Down owned by the Landlord within Eldoret Town in the Republic of Kenya.






2.
The Firm of E. Kinyanjui & Co. Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter.






3.
The Respondent, Mohib Teherali Abdul Hussein is the owner of the Go-Down rented by the Tenant herein and hence the Landlord.






4.
The Firm of W. Kevin Michuki & Company Advocates represents the Landlord in this matter.








B. Dispute Background


5.
The Tenant moved this Tribunal vide a Reference and a Notice of Motion Application dated 9
th
 February 2024 seeking orders certifying the matter as urgent, restraining the Landlord and his agents, servants and/or personal representatives from levying distress against the Tenant and declaring the distrain for rent illegal, irregular invalid and incompetent.






6.
When the matter came up for hearing on 19
th
 February 2024, the parties recorded a consent agreeing to open a joint interest earning account within 7 days wherein the Tenant would deposit rent arrears in the sum of KShs. 800,000.00 pending the determination of rent owing and issuance of ETR receipts. Further, the Court directed that parties exchange statements of accounts within 14 days and that the Tenant pays rent for the month of March before the next hearing date.






7.
On 3
rd
 April 2024, the parties confirmed that they had opened a joint interest earning account and that the Tenant had deposited the rent arrears owing but the Landlord was yet to issue the Tennant with an ETR Receipt.






8.
Consequently, the Tenant’s Reference and Application were settled by consent on condition that the amount deposited in the joint account be released to the Landlord upon issuance of ETR Receipts and invoices to the Tenant’s Advocates for onward transmission to the Tenant. As such, the Landlord undertook to issue the ETR Receipts upon payment of rent within 5 days and that the said undertaking would lapse within 3 months and the Landlord to keep issuing ETR Receipts upon payment of rent.






9.
Subsequently, the Tenant filed an Application dated 2
nd
 May 2024 under a certificate of urgency seeking orders certifying the matter as urgent, restraining the Landlord and its agents, Eshikhoni Auctioneers from levying distress on the Tenant pending the hearing and determination of the Application and orders declaring the distrain from rent undertaken on 29
th
 April 2024.






10.
The Landlord filed an Application dated 9
th
 May 2024 seeking orders compelling the Tenant’s Advocates to sign RTGS forms for releasing the rent arrears deposited in the joint account to the Landlord and in the alternative, the branch manager African Banking Corporation Ltd Bank be ordered to release the amount of rent arrears.






11.
It is the Tenant’s Application dated 2
nd
 May 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 9
th
 May 2024 that are the subject of this ruling.








C. The Tenant’s Case


12.
The Tenant’s Application is based on the grounds that at the beginning of 2023, the Landlord instructed it to pay part rent of KShs. 80,000.00 by cheque while a further amount of KShs. 160,000.00 was to be paid in cash to various phone numbers as provided by the Landlord until November 2023 when the Tenant requested to be furnished ETR Receipts for the period between 2021 to 2023.






13.
It is the Tenant’s case that it stopped paying KShs. 160,000.00 as the Landlord was not willing to give ETR receipts in respect of that amount. Consequently, the Tenant agrees that the arrears owing amount to KShs. 800,000.00 which it has deposited in a joint interest earning account in light of the consent Order dated 3
rd
 April 2024 and which amount is to be released upon issuance of ETR receipts by the Landlord.






14.
The Tenant submits that it is unfair for the Landlord to be allowed to distress for rent while he has failed to comply with the Consent Order to enable the Tenant’s Advocates to release the funds to him.








D. The Landlords’ Case


15.
The Landlord claims that he has issued the Invoices and ETR Receipts to the Tenant’s Advocates on 17
th
 April 2024 but the Tenant’s Advocates failed to release funds to him contrary to the Consent Order dated 3
rd
 April 2024.






16.
It is the Landlord’s case that the Tenant’s fresh demands to issue receipts from 2021 to 2023 does not absolve the Tenant from paying rent and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate on tax matters.








E. Issues For Determination


17.
I have given full consideration to the Tenant’s Notice of Motion Application 2
nd
 May 2024, the Landlord’s Application dated 9
th
 May 2024, and all other materials placed before this Court. It is my considered opinion that the following issues fall for determination:
a.
Whether the consent order dated 3
rd
 April 2024 should be set aside
b.
Whether the amount held in the interest earning escrow account should be released to the Landlord?








F. Analysis And Determination
a.
Whether the consent order dated 3
rd
 April 2024 should be set aside






18.
I note that the principles that appertain to setting aside of a consent order are well established in a line of cases including Brooke Bond Liebig vs Mallya (1975) EA 266 where Mustafa Ag. VP stated thus;
“
The compromise agreement was made an order of the court and was thus a consent judgment. It is well settled that a consent judgment can be set aside only in certain circumstances, e.g on grounds of fraud or collusion, that there was no consensus between the parties, public policy or for such reasons as would enable a court to set aside or rescind a contract. In this case the parties and their advocates consented to the compromise in very clear terms; they were certainly aware of all the material facts and there could not have been any mistake or misunderstanding. None of the factors which could give rise to the setting aside of a consent agreement existed.”






19.
I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Board of Trustees National Social Security Fund versus Micheal Mwalo [2015] eKLR where the Court gave the grounds upon which consent judgment may be set aside in the case of as follows;
“
The law pertaining to setting aside of consent judgments or consent orders has been clearly stated. A Court of law will not interfere with a consent judgment except in circumstances such as would provide a good ground for varying or rescinding a contract between parties. To impeach a consent order or a consent judgment, it must be shown that it was obtained by fraud, or collusion or by an agreement contrary to the policy of Court.”






20.
In the instant case, the Tenant insists that the Landlord has failed to comply with the Consent Orders of this Honorable Court by failing to issue ETR receipts for the period between 2021 and 2023 and that the same should be set aside and its Reference heard on merit.






21.
I note that on the other hand, the Landlord insists that he issued the ETR receipts as required vide a letter dated 17
th
 April 2024 which lists the ETR receipt for KShs. 110,344.83, invoice dated 11
th
 April 2024 for KShs. 800,000.00, Invoice dated 21
st
 March 2024 for KShs. 240,000 for the rent for March, Invoice dated 10
th
 April 2024 for KShs. 240,000 for the rent for April and an RTGS Application form dated 18
th
 April 2024.






22.
It is clear that the Landlord has not provided any ETR receipts for the period between 2021 to 2023 as well as for the months of March and April 2024. In fact, the Landlord believes that the Tenant’s demand for ETR receipts for the period between 2021 and 2023 amounts to a fresh demand.






23.
In the circumstances, it is my opinion that at the time of recording the Consent Order, there was a misunderstanding as to the period for which the ETR receipts were to be issued. I am therefore convinced that the Consent Order dated 3
rd
 April 2024 ought to be set aside to allow this Court to make a determination on the matter.
b.
Whether the amount should be released to the Landlord.






24.
Having set aside the Consent Order, is noteworthy that the Landlord he has to pay the amount in advance to generate the ETR receipt. I note that the Landlord has already issued a receipt in respect of the amount held in the escrow account. In the circumstances, is only fair that the Tenant releases the rent arrears in the escrow account to the Landlord.






25.
However, I note that the Landlord has issued the invoices but is yet to issue the ETR receipts for the months of March and April which he ought to have done by now.
c.
Whether the Landlord should be allowed to levy distress for rent






26.
Pursuant to Section 3 of the 
Distress for Rent Act
, Cap 292 Laws of Kenya, the landlord has a right to levy distress for rent as follows:
“
Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other written law, any person having any rent or rent service in arrear and due upon a grant, lease, demise or contract shall have the same remedy by distress for the recovery of that rent or rent service as is given by the common law of England in a similar case.”






27.
However, this right must be exercised according to the Law. In this instance, the rent arrears owing is not in dispute. In fact, the Tenant had demonstrated goodwill and complied with the consent order by depositing KShs. 800,000.00 being the arrears owing.






28.
Therefore, it is quite unfair for the Landlord to distress for rent when the Tenant has already paid the arrears into an escrow account and which amount was to be released upon complying with the Consent Order. I therefore find the proclamation dated 29
th
 April to be illegal.






G. Determination
H.
In the upshot, the Tenant’s Application and Reference dated 2
nd
 May 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 9
th
 May 2024 are hereby partially allowed in the following terms:
a.
The Consent Order dated 
3
rd
 April 2024
 is hereby set aside;
b.
The Landlord is hereby restrained form levying distress for rent;
c.
The rent arrears in the escrow account shall be released to the Landlord who shall within 7 days issue ETR Receipts failure to which the Tenant shall be at liberty to withhold further rent payment and apply for further directions;
d.
The Tenant shall continue paying rent on or before the 5
th
 of every month and ETR shall follow within 5 days, failure to which the Tenant shall be at liberty to withhold further rent payment and apply for further directions; and
e.
Each party to bear their own costs.

Ruling










A. Parties And Their Reprersentatives


1.
The Applicant, Rose Atieno together with 5 others, (hereinafter ‘the tenants’) have been tenants of business premises known as Plot No. 44 Rabai Road Light Industries, located in Burburu, Nairobi (hereafter ‘the suit premises’), for a period of 16 years to date; duly paying rent and have no any rent arrears.






2.
The firm of S. N Thuku & Associates is on record for the Tenants.






3.
The 2
nd
 respondent, Bernard Korir (the 2nd respondent) claims that he is the legal owner of the land where the suit premises is built.






4.
The 2
nd
 respondent acts on his own capacity in the suit.








B. Background Of The Dispute


5.
The tenants moved this Tribunal by away of a Notice of Motion dated 28
th
 May 2024 under certificate of urgency of even date. The tenants sought, inter alia, injunction orders restraining the 2
nd
 respondent from evicting, attempting to evict, attaching, selling or interfering with the tenant’s business premises.






6.
The tenants claim that the 2
nd
 respondent unreasonably issued a notice threatening to demolish their shops through a letter dated 24
th
 May 2024 addressed to Buruburu Police Station attached to the application as SNT 1. They further aver that it seems there is a land ownership dispute between the 1
st
 and the 2
nd
 respondent which should not affect them. CMELC NO. E193 OF 2022.






7.
Accordingly, the tribunal on 4
th
 June 2024 ordered that the applicant to serve the Application for inter partes hearing on 11
th
 June 2024.






8.
The 2
nd
 respondent responded to the tenants claims through a replying affidavit dated 19
th
 July 2024. He claims that notice to vacate the suit premises was duly issued on 1
st
 July 2024 to the tenants and that 6 tenants had already vacated the suit premises. However, there is no attachment of the said notice to this tribunal.






9.
The 2
nd
 respondent further avers that he owns the piece of land upon which the suit premises is built and requests the tribunal to summon Mr. Phillip Odengo, the 1
st
 respondent to produce the documents before the honorable tribunal to verify his ownership of the piece of land.








C. Issues For Determination


10.
Having carefully perused the Application and Responses presented by parties, it is therefore my respectful finding that the issues for determination before this honorable tribunal are:
a.
Whether Notice to Vacate the Suit Premises issued by the 2
nd
 respondent valid?
b.
Whether this tribunal has the requisite jurisdictions to summon the 1
st
 respondent to produce documents to verify legal ownership of the land in which the suit premises are situated?








D. Analysis And Determination


a.          Whether the Notice to Vacate the suit premises issued by the 2
nd
 respondent valid?


11.
Notice of termination of tenancy is a matter of law under Section 4 (2) of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter “the Act”) and must be taken into consideration by both parties in a tenancy relationship.






12.
The position of the law on the issue of termination notice is now settled. The court in Manaver N. Alibahai T/A Diani Boutique vs South Coast Fitness 7 & Sports Centre Ltd, Civil Appeal No. 203n of 1994, stated that:
“
The Act lays down clearly and in detail, the procedure for the termination of a controlled tenancy. Section 4(1) of the Act states in very clear language that a controlled tenancy shall not terminate or be terminated, and no term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of, any such tenancy shall be altered, otherwise than in accordance with specified provisions of the Act. These provisions include the giving of a notice in the prescribed form. The notice shall not take effect earlier than 2 months from the date of receipt thereof by the tenant. The notice must also specify the ground upon which termination is sought. The prescribed notice in Form A also requires the landlord to ask the tenant to notify him in writing whether or not the tenant agrees to comply with the notice.”






13.
It is evident that the letter addressed to the Buruburu Police Station dated 24
th
 May 2024 herein was not in the prescribed form by the Act. Further, the termination letter did not specify when the eviction was to take place as it indicated at paragraph 
2
; “...…. that any day from now, I will be removing some illegal structures built in my plot….” And that there is no tenancy relationship between the tenants and the 2
nd
 respondent.






14.
Hence, it is my finding that the Notice issued does not meet the requirement of the Act and therefore invalid. Accordingly, I will proceed to address the 2
nd
 issue.








b.           Whether this tribunal has jurisdictions to summon the 1
st
 respondent to produce documents to verify legal ownership of the land in which the suit premises is situated?


15.
The 2
nd
 respondent has invited this honorable Tribunal to summon the 1
st
 respondent to produce documents to prove ownership of the land upon which the suit premises is built. It is therefore necessary for the tribunal to determine whether it is within its confine to grant such orders.






16.
This tribunal is a creature of the statute and derives its powers from the statute that creates it. Its jurisdiction is thus limited by the statute. It can only do that which statute empowered it to do since its powers are express and cannot be implied. It is with that in mind that I find that under Section 12 of the Act, this tribunal can only determine disputes relating to:
i.
The amount of rent payable by a tenant;
ii.
The termination of tenancy;
iii.
The recovery of possession of a business premises by a landlord; and
iv.
Any other matter relating to business premises rent.






17.
Based on the above analysis, I find that this tribunal lacks jurisdiction over land ownership disputes, which fall within the exclusive purview of the Environment and Land Court.






18.
Before a determination is therefore made in CMELC NO E193 OF 2022 the presumption as to ownership will remain on the occupant of the land in this case Philip 1
st
 Respondent unless there is an express order to the contrary from the Magistrates Court granting 2
nd
 Respondent the said rights even on a temporary basis.










E. Orders


19.
In the upshot, the Tenants’ Application dated 28
th
 May 2024 is hereby allowed in the following terms:
i.
The eviction notice issued by the 2
nd
 respondent through a letter dated 24
th
 May 2024 is invalid;
ii.
The 2
nd
 respondent is hereby restrained from evicting, attempting to evict, attaching, selling or interfering in any way with the tenants ‘business premises until the dispute on ownership of the land upon which the suit premises is built is determined by a competent court with requisite jurisdiction;
iii.
The tenants to continue paying rent to whoever they have been paying;
iv.
The OCS Buruburu Police Station to ensure compliance; and
v.
Each party to bear their cost.

and




Rachel Mburu


 


Landlord










Ruling










A. Parties and their Representatives


1.
Jackson K. Mathenge (the “Tenant”) is the proprietor of the Business known as Tukutane Pub situated on Shops No. 2A & B erected on land parcel no. Thika Majengo Block 11/233 (the “suit premises”).






2.
The Firm of S.B Otieno & Co. Advocates represents the Tenant in this matter






3.
Rachel Mburu (the “Landlord”) is the registered owner of all that premises erected on land parcel no. Thika Majengo Block 11/233.






4.
The Landlord appears in person.








B. Background Of The Dispute


5.
Through a Reference and an Application dated 19
th
 September, 2022 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Landlord be compelled to reopen the suit premises and allow the Tenant free access to the premises and failure to open the Tenant to break and gain access with the assistance of the OCS Thika Police Station, the Landlord be restrained from evicting, harassing and/or interfering with the Tenant and the OCS Thika Police Station to assist with compliance.






6.
Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application and Reference, the Honourable Tribunal, on 20
th
 September, 2024, ordered the Landlord to reopen the suit premises and allow the Tenant free access to the premises and failure to open the Tenant to break and gain access with the assistance of the OCS Thika Police Station and the OCS Thika Police Station to assist with compliance.






7.
Due to non-appearance of the parties, on 5
th
 April, 2023, this Honourable Tribunal dismissed the suit herein. The Tenant filed a letter dated 9
th
 May, 2023 highlighting reasons for the non-appearance and consequently, the Tribunal reinstated the suit for hearing and determination on merits and fixed the matter for hearing on 13
th
 July, 2023.






8.
On 13
th
 July, 2023, the Honourable Tribunal dismissed the suit again due to non-appearance.






9.
The Tenant through an Application dated 26
th
 April, 2024 canvassed through a Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Tribunal be pleased to set aside and/or review its order issued on 13
th
 July, 2023, the suit herein be reinstated and fixed for hearing and the Tenant be allowed to deposit the rent for the premises in the Tribunal.






10.
Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application dated 26
th
 April, 2024, the Tribunal, on 9
th
 May, 2024, directed the matter be fixed for hearing on 11
th
 June, 2024.






11.
In response to the Tenant’s Applications dated 19
th
 September, 2022 and 26
th
 April, 2024, the Landlord filed a Replying Affidavit and a Notice of Preliminary Objection both dated 5
th
 July, 2024.






12.
The Honourable Tribunal, on 8
th
 July, 2024, directed the parties to file Submissions. The Landlord filed her Submissions on 17
th
 July, 2024 in support of the Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5
th
 July, 2024 while the Landlords filed his Submissions on 24
th
 July, 2024.






13.
It is therefore the Landlord’s Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5
th
 July, 2024 that is the subject of this Ruling.








C. Landlord’s Case


14.
The Landlord avers that there no longer exists a tenancy relationship between herself and the Tenant, as the Tenant vacated the suit premises on 1
st
 June, 2024 per the Notice to Terminate the tenancy dated 13
th
 March, 2024. She contends that this Honourable Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to determine the subject of the Tenant’s Applications as there exists no tenancy relationship between her and the Tenant.








D. Tenant’s Case


15.
The Tenant affirms that at the time reference was filed, he was Tenant of the suit premises. He avers that at all material times relevant to the Reference herein, there existed a Tenancy relationship between the parties herein.








E. Jurisdiction


16.
The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Court has been contested by the Landlord vide a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5
th
 July, 2024.






17.
It is the Landlord’s contention that currently there exists no tenancy relationship between the parties herein as the Tenant has since vacated the premises. The Notice of the Preliminary Objection is premised on Section 2(1) as read with Section 12 (1) (a) and 12 (4) 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, Cap 301, Laws of Kenya.








F. Issues For Determination


18.
Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by the parties. It is therefore my respectful finding that the sole issue for determination is: Whether this Honourable Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject of the suit.








G. Analysis And Findings


i.        Whether this Honourable Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject of the suit.


19.
This Honourable Tribunal has the duty to interrogate the question of jurisdiction and satisfy itself before making any further step in line with the celebrated case of Owners of the Motor Vessel ‘Lillian S’ Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited [1989] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held as follows:
“
I think that it is reasonably plain that a question of jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest opportunity and the court seized of the matter is then obliged to decide the issue right away on the material before it…”






20.
In the matter herein, it is the Landlord’s contention that the consequence of the Tenant vacating the premises was that it extinguished the tenancy relationship between the parties herein and subsequently, the jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal as provided under Section 2 of Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya. Additionally, the Landlord contends that the Notice of Preliminary Objection is founded on a question of jurisdiction as set out by the Court in Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd v West End Distributors (1969) EA 696, where the court stated that:
“
Consists of a point of law which has been pleaded or which arises by clear implication out of the pleadings…Examples are an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, or a plea of limitation…”






21.
In response, the Tenant notes that the Reference herein was filed during the pendency of the tenancy relationship between the parties herein. As such the Reference was properly filed and thus this Honourable Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine it.






22.
A Notice to vacate a premises does not oust the jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal as such ouster can only take place once all pending matters before the Tribunal have been resolved. As such, it is crucial to assess the reference and the subsequent pleadings filed herein to establish pending issues in the matter herein.






23.
Upon assessment of the Reference and Pleadings filed herein, there are two issues for determination; whether the Tenant’s Application dated 19
th
 September, 2022 has been spent and whether there are any outstanding rent owed.






24.
I duly note that the prayers sought by the Tenant vide his Reference and Application dated 19
th
 September, 2022 have since been spent as the Tenant moved out of the suit premises. The prayers pleaded for have since been overtaken by events. The tenancy relationship between the parties was severed when the Tenant vacated the suit premises hence he cannot claim the rights accrued to Tenant as prayed in his Application.






25.
Similarly, the Landlord’s claim for outstanding rent arrears of Kshs. 115,050.00 as at June, 2024 has since been abandoned and/or dropped by the Landlord due to the Notice of Preliminary Objection filed.






26.
In light of the above, this Honourable Tribunal notes that all pending issues before the Tribunal have since been dispensed with.










H. Orders


27.
In the upshot the following orders shall abide;
a.
The Landlord’s Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 5
th
 July, 2024 is hereby allowed;
b.
The Tenant’s Reference dated 19
th
 September, 2022 is hereby dismissed.
c.
No orders as to costs.

B. Background Of The Dispute


5.
Through a Reference and an Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, the Tenant moved this Honourable Tribunal seeking the following orders that inter-alia: the Landlord be compelled to reopen the suit premises, the Landlord be restrained from arbitrarily increasing the monthly rent, the Tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment to the suit premises be affirmed and the Landlord be restrained from evicting, harassing and/or interfering with the Tenant.






6.
Upon perusal of the Tenant’s Application and Reference, the Honourable Tribunal, on 9
th
 April,2024, directed the matter be fixed for hearing on 16
th
 April, 2024.






7.
On 14
th
 May, 2024, the matter came up for mention where the Honourable Tribunal directed the Landlord to immediately reopen the suit premises in the interim pending hearing and determination of the Tenant’s Application.






8.
The Landlord, vide an Application dated 17
th
 May, 2024 canvassed through Certificate of Urgency of even date, sought inter-alia the directions issued on 14
th
 May, 2024 be varied and/or set aside and an order for compensation be issued in favour of the Landlord in the sum of Kshs. 300,000.00 being unpaid rent, legal costs and loss of user of premises.






9.
Upon perusal of the Landlord’s Application, the Tribunal directed the same be heard on 25
th
 June, 2024. On 25
th
 June, 2024, the Tribunal directed the Landlord to respond to the Tenant’s Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024 within 7 days and subsequently, the Tenant to respond to the Landlord’s Application dated 17
th
 May, 2024 within 7 days.






10.
The Landlord, in response to the Tenant’s Application, filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by the Managing Director of the Landlord on 1
st
 July, 2024.






11.
Subsequently, the Tenant, in response to the Landlord’s Application, filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on 3
rd
 July, 2024 and a Further Affidavit dated 23
rd
 July, 2024.






12.
It is therefore the Tenant’s Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024 and the Landlord’s Application dated 17
th
 May, 2024 that are the subject of this Ruling.








C. Tenant’s Case


13.
The Tenant admitted to entering into a tenancy agreement with the Landlord on 10
th
 February, 2023.






14.
The Tenant vide his Further Affidavit sworn on 23
rd
 July, 2024 avers that the Landlord had locked the suit premises between March, 2024 and 16
th
 May, 2024. He notes that this cause of action was due to the arbitrary increase of 20% of the monthly rent. In addition, the Tenant avers that at the time of forced closure he had no outstanding rent arrears. Contrarily, the Tenant, vide Further Affidavit admits to being in arrears of Kshs. 31,000.00 as at February, 2024 which he settled in March, 2024.






15.
The Tenant notes that the Landlord’s action is unfair and unjust and have caused him undue hardship and distress.








D. Landlord’s Case


16.
The Landlord, vide the Managing Director’s sworn statement, affirmed that it had entered into a lease agreement over the suit premises with Tenant herein where it was agreed that the monthly rent would be equivalent to Kshs. 50,000.00. The Landlord averred that as at July 2023 the Tenant had fallen into arrears to the sum of Kshs. 155,000.00. He further noted that, in spirit of being accommodative, the Landlord entered into a payment plan dated 14
th
 July, 2023 with the Tenant to settle the outstanding arrears.






17.
The Landlord swore that the Tenant was yet to settle his arrears which had increased to Kshs. 204,000.00 contrary to Tenant’s misrepresentation. Consequently, and as a result of the outstanding arrears, the Landlord avers that it was forced to issue a Termination Notice dated 12
th
 March, 2024 and distress for rent arrears of Kshs. 94,000.00. The Landlord averred that it instructed Jogan Dries Auctioneers to effect the distress.






18.
The Landlord avers that Tenant has since vacated the premises and it was in the process of procuring another Tenant.






19.
The Landlord stated that due to the prevailing economic circumstances it had increased the rent by Kshs. 5,000.00. It noted that the same had been communicated to all the Tenants. Additionally, it stated that the Tenant’s claim that rent had been increased by 20% was false and a misrepresentation.






20.
The Landlord sought the Tenant’s Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024 to be dismissed.








E. Jurisdiction


21.
The Jurisdiction of this Honourable Tribunal is not contested by either party and therefore is not in dispute.








F. Issues For Determination


22.
Having carefully perused the Pleadings presented before this Honourable Tribunal by th  DIVISION - e parties. It is therefore my respectful finding that the issues for determination are:
a.
Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024;
b.
Whether this Honourable Tribunal should set aside and/or vacate the Orders issued on 29
th
 February, 2024; and
c.
Whether the Landlord is entitled to an Order of Compensation of Kshs. 300,000.00 being unpaid rent, damages and loss of user of premises.








G. Analysis


a.          Whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024;


23.
Vide the Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024, the Tenant sought to restrain the Landlord from interfering with his right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the suit premises without unnecessary interference from the Landlord and that the Landlord be restrained from arbitrarily increasing the monthly rent.






24.
This Honourable Tribunal notes that the Tenant has since vacated the premises






25.
On alteration of terms of a controlled tenancy, the Landlord must satisfy two conditions, that is, the notice must be in writing and duration allowed must be at least two months. Section 4 (2) of the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya (hereinafter “Cap 301”) provides that:
“
(2)
A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or to alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under, such a tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form”






26.
This Honourable Tribunal appreciates the Notice issued by the Landlord on 23
rd
 February, 2024 increasing the rent from Kshs. 50,000.00 to Kshs. 55,000.00. The Tribunal notes that the Landlord cited the prevailing economic situation and cost of living crisis as the reason for the rental increase.






27.
However, for an alteration of terms notice to be valid, the duration given for effect must be two months. Section 4 (4) of the Act provides that:
“
No tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party”






28.
The abovementioned notice was due to take effect in the month of April, 2024. This Honourable Tribunal notes that the Landlord afforded the Tenant a one-month allowance. The time allowance provided is thus inadequate contrary to the provision of Section 4 (4) of Cap 301.






29.
Though the Landlord properly issued the notice, the duration allowed was short contrary to the provisions of Section 4 (4). Therefore, the notice issued was improper thus null and void.








b.          Whether this Honourable Tribunal should set aside and/or vacate the Orders issued on 29
th
 February, 2024;


30.
Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows: -
“


1.
(1)
Any person considering himself aggrieved—          by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or          by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason (emphasis added), desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.”








31.
The Court in the case of Republic v Public Procurement Administrative Review Board & 2 others [2018] e KLR held that: -
“
Section 80 gives the power of review and Order 45 sets out the rules. The rules restrict the grounds for review. The rules lay down the jurisdiction and scope of review limiting it to the following grounds; (a) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made or; (b) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (c) for any other sufficient reason and whatever the ground there is a requirement that the application has to be made without unreasonable delay.”






32.
The powers of the Business Premises Rent Tribunal are provided by the Cap 301 Section 12(1)(i) of the Act provides that:
“
A Tribunal shall, in relation to its area of jurisdiction have power to do all things which it is required or empowered to do by or under the provisions of this Act, and in addition to and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall have power­-          ovary or rescind any order made by the Tribunal under the provisions of this Act;”






33.
A reading of Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 Cap 21, Section 12(1)(i) of the Landlord and Tenant Shops Hotels and Catering Establishments Act, Cap 301 Laws of Kenya and Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provide for that the power to review orders can be exercised on application of a person and which Application could be based on the three grounds provided. The Courts have further espoused that where an application is grounded on sufficient reason it is for the court to exercise its discretion. On this matter I am guided by the Court decision in Tokesi Mambili and others vs Simion Litsanga {2004} eKLR where the court noted that:
“
….ii. Where the application is based on sufficient reason it is for the Court to exercise its discretion.”






34.
In light of the above, this Tribunal notes that the Application brought by the Landlord places reliance on the third ground for review provided under Order 45 Rule 1 of the CPR. It is the Landlord’s case that the Tenant misrepresented the facts of the case herein. The Landlord avers that the Tenant did not inform the Honourable Tribunal of his outstanding arrears of Kshs. 204,000.00 and exaggerated the fact that rent had only been increased by Kshs. 5,000.00 which is 10%.






35.
In his Application dated 4
th
 April, 2024, the Tenant averred that he did not have any outstanding rent. Additionally, he averred that the Landlord, without any just cause or legal basis locked him out of the premises and had unilaterally increased the rent by 20%. An assessment of the documentary evidence filed, this Honourable Tribunal notes that the Tenant had misrepresented the facts.






36.
For that reason and after careful consideration of the facts and pleadings presented to this Tribunal, I find that the Landlord has provided sufficient reason within the meaning of Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Cap 21 and Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.








d.            Whether the Landlord is entitled to an Order of Compensation of Kshs. 300,000.00


37.
It is trite law that a claim for special damages have to be claimed and strictly proved by evidence. On this I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Richard Okuku Oloo v South Nyanza Sugar Co. Ltd (2013) eKLR where the Court held that:
“
We agree with the learned judge that a claim for special damages must indeed be specifically pleaded and proved with a degree of certainty and particularity but we must add that, that degree and certainty must necessarily depend on the circumstances and the nature of the act complained of.”






38.
In the matter herein, the Landlord produced a copy of the statement of rent paid by the Tenant from 1
st
 February, 2023 to 1
st
 May, 2024. The Landlord’s claim for compensation is founded on the unpaid rent, general damages and the loss of a Tenant.






39.
This Honourable Tribunal is therefore mandated to establish the amount, if any, of the special damages the Landlord is entitled to be compensated. The Landlord claims Kshs. 300,000.00 as compensation for the losses suffered. Therefore, this Tribunal has to interrogate the extent of the breach of the tenancy to warrant compensation.






40.
On the issue of outstanding rent, the Landlord vide Annexure NSA-3 attached to the Application dated 17
th
 May, 2024, provided a copy of the Tenant’s rent statement as at 1
st
 May, 2024. The statement provides the rent paid and the outstanding balance. The balance provided is Kshs. 204,000.00. Though the outstanding balance has been disputed by the Tenant, he failed to produce any evidence challenging the same. The Statement filed by the Tenant as Annexure PAY-1, PAY-2 and PAY-3 failed to highlight any payment to the Landlord.






41.
This Honourable Tribunal, under issue 1, addressed itself on the issue of rent increment in which it invalidated the notice issued by the Landlord. Thus, the outstanding rent for the months of April, 2024 and May, 2024 is Kshs. 50,000.00 and not the Kshs. 55,000.00 claimed by the Landlord.






42.
In light of the above, the outstanding rent amount owed by the Tenant and proven by the Landlord is Kshs. 194,000.00.






43.
With the foregoing in mind, and after careful consideration of the pleadings and evidence filed thereof, I find that the Landlord is entitled to Kshs. 194,000.00 being the unpaid rent.






44.
The Tribunal finds no evidential basis for a claim of damages.










H. Determination And Orders


45.
In the upshot, the following orders shall abide:
a.
The Tenant’s Application and Reference dated 4
th
 April, 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs at Kshs. 10,000.00;
b.
The Landlord’s Application dated 17
th
 May, 2024 is hereby partially upheld in terms of prayer 3;
c.
This Tribunal’s Interim Orders issued on 14
th
 May, 2024 are hereby set aside;
d.
The Rental Increase Notice dated 23
rd
 February, 2024 is hereby declared null and void;
e.
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord Kshs. 204,000.00 being outstanding rent of Kshs. 194,000.00 and legal costs assessed at Kshs. 10,000.00 of the suit herein made by the Tenant;
f.
The amount in (e) above to be paid by the Tenant within 60 days of the pronouncement of this Ruling; and

II. The Claimant’s Case


6.
The claimant’s case is expressed in the memorandum of claim, oral and documentary evidence adduced through the claimant (CW1), and the written submissions by his counsel.






7.
In the memorandum of claim, the claimant pleads that at the material time he was an employee of the 2
nd
 respondent as a registered teacher based at 1
st
 respondent’s high school. The claimant states that he was employed on 1
st
 September, 1994 and served in many high schools as a graduate teacher.






8.
It is pleaded that in a letter dated 20
th
 August, 2013, the 2
nd
 respondent, through county director of education, Nakuru, transferred the claimant from St Joseph’s Elburgon Secondary School to Nakuru Boys’ High School with effect from 27
th
 August, 2018. The claimant states that he reported to his new school on 27
th
 August, 2018 and was received by the secretary to the 1
st
 respondent.






9.
The claimant states that he attended classes as assigned and performed his duties diligently while adhering strictly to the code of ethics as set by the 2
nd
 respondent. The claimant further states that on 23
rd
 December, 2019 he was called by the 1
st
 respondent’s secretary (the principal of the school) and handed an interdiction letter which stated that he had been interdicted with effect from 6
th
 December, 2019.






10.
The letter of interdiction contained several allegations against the claimant such as inciting staff during a staff meeting held on 12
th
 April, 2019, and failing to repay money advanced to him by the school. A second letter of interdiction was issued, reiterating the previous allegations and allegedly adding new ones. The claimant responded to those allegations and provided what he considered to be the necessary supporting documents.






11.
It is pleaded that after responding to the above letter, the secretary to the 1
st
 respondent purported to summon the claimant to attend a disciplinary hearing on 2
nd
 December, 2019. He pleads that the letter inviting him to the hearing was not served upon the claimant but the same was served upon the 2
nd
 respondent. Subsequently, after issuing the second letter to attend the disciplinary hearing, which was not served the claimant, the 1
st
 respondent proceeded to discuss the matter on 6
th
 December, 2019 in the claimant’s absence resulting in a unanimous decision to have the claimant interdicted with immediate effect.






12.
The claimant states that pursuant to the said decision, the claimant’s case was forwarded to the 2
nd
 respondent for further action since the claimant was an employee of the 2
nd
 respondent. The matter was forwarded to the 2
nd
 respondent and the claimant was summoned for a disciplinary hearing vide a letter dated 21
st
 May, 2021. The hearing was scheduled for 24
th
 June, 2021. The claimant pleads that he attended the disciplinary hearing notwithstanding serious reservations about the process including lack of response to his request that he be supplied with various documents, inter-alia, communication on the disciplinary meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019, to no avail.






13.
Subsequently, the 2
nd
 respondent dismissed the claimant vide a letter dated 1
st
 July, 2021.






14.
On 3
rd
 March, 2022, the claimant's dismissal was upheld after his request for a review/appeal was dismissed. It is contended that the acts of omission and commission on the part of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents were not only illegal and fraudulent but also a breach of the rules of natural justice.






15.
The particulars of the alleged illegality on the actions by the respondents are alleged to include -
a.
The 1
st
 respondent’s purport to interdict the claimant without complying with regulations 145, 146, 147, and 149 of the Teachers’ Service Commission Code of Regulation.
b.
The 1
st
 respondent purporting to proceed with a disciplinary action in the absence of the claimant while at the same time offering a verdict to interdict
c.
The 1
st
 respondent purported to conduct a disciplinary meeting against the claimant on 6
th
 December, 2019 while the same had not been notified to the claimant and was not part of the agenda
d.
The 2
nd
 respondent purporting to participate in the disciplinary action against the claimant in contravention of the 2
nd
 respondent’s code of regulations
e.
The 2
nd
 respondent purporting to interdict the claimant at the behest of the 1
st
 respondent knowing well it was in contravention of the regulations and without adhering to the rules of National Justice
f.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents purporting to carry out disciplinary hearing against the claimant without following the laid down procedures for such hearing
g.
The 2
nd
 respondent purported to interdict and eventually dismiss the claimant on unsubstantiated allegations while knowing very well that the entire process was sham and flawed.






16.
It is pleaded that the entire disciplinary process and the subsequent dismissal was null and void ab initio. It is pleaded that despite several attempts to have the matter resolved in compliance with the laid down laws and regulations, and after giving notice of intention to sue, the respondents have continued to perpetuate the alleged illegality.






17.
In his testimony in court the claimant reiterated the foregoing pleadings and testified that he was an employee of the 2
nd
 respondent as from 1
st
 September, 1994. He stated that he taught in schools in Laikipia and Nakuru Counties. He stated that he was interdicted by the 1
st
 respondent on 6
th
 December, 2019. He alleged to have received the letter of interdiction on 23
rd
 December, 2019. In the letter it was alleged that he had breached several clauses including clauses (iv), B (vi) and (vii) of the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) Code of conduct.






18.
He was accused of inciting teachers in a staff meeting held on 12
th
 April, 2019, insubordination for failing to attend a Board of Management (BOM) meeting after invitation on 6
th
 December, 2019, and soliciting for funds from parents and the public. He stated that the letter was inviting him to attend a meeting on 2
nd
 December, 2019 which was allegedly communicated via text message.






19.
In his testimony in court the claimant stated that on 15
th
 January, 2020, he received an undated letter from his employer, the 2
nd
 respondent, and subsequently he was contacted by the county director and informed of his interdiction which he was unaware of. He was advised to submit his defence to the interdiction, if he so intended. However, on 27
th
 October, 2020 he was served with an amended letter of interdiction that contained the same allegations as the previous two letters.






20.
He stated that he lodged a defence and refuted all the allegations and demanded to be supplied with the documents that the respondents had applied in interdicting him. He stated that the disciplinary hearing was to be held in a week and that he received some of the documents. He stated that he was not served with a disciplinary hearing notice and that he was given only some of the documents that he had requested for.






21.
He stated that he was invited to a virtual disciplinary hearing conducted by the 2
nd
 respondent on 24th June, 2021. He stated that witnesses were called and questioned on each of the allegations. The claimant admitted that he asked for money from parents for text books and that he allegedly delivered the books as agreed and to his knowledge there were no complaints from parents or the students.






22.
On a loan of Kshs20,000/= advanced to him by the 1
st
 respondent, he said that he was suspended before starting the repayment process. He claimed to have repaid a sum of Kshs5,000/= in January 2020 but the balance of the money remains unpaid to this day.






23.
On the allegation of solicitation of funds be stated that he was not teaching at Afraha High School in 2018 but he taught thereat in 2017. He stated that he provided Mpesa statements for 2017 and 2018 in demonstrating that he had not received any funds as alleged. However, the court notes that no such statements were filed in court.






24.
He stated that he was dismissed but appealed the dismissal on the basis that he was not notified of the hearing scheduled for 6
th
 December, 2018. He stated that his appeal was dismissed and the dismissal was upheld vide a letter dated 9
th
 March, 2022. He stated that he was not invited to the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019 as confirmed in the minutes presented in the court. He stated that the meeting was unprocedural as no witnesses were called and he did not get an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. He stated that the interdiction was based on the resolutions of the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019. He stated that there was no written complaint filed against him in any of the schools where he taught.






25.
He further stated that during the interdiction he was supposed to be receiving half of his basic salary but it is only after the dismissal that the same was paid in arrears. He stated that no investigation report was filed with TSC and he was not served with any such report. Additionally, he stated that the disciplinary hearing panel was supposed to be chaired by a commissioner but this did not happen. He stated that the proceedings at the TSC were for all intents and purposes illegal and un-procedural.






26.
He added that he was not charged with any criminal offence(s). He produced his filed documents as exhibits 1 to 24.






27.
In cross-examination by counsel for the 1
st
 respondent, the claimant stated that he was in Afraha High School until he was suspended on grounds of desertion. He confirmed that the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019 discussed his alleged misconduct and that he agreed to refund same money to one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1), who had complained against him vide a letter dated 23
rd
 January, 2019. He admitted that there was another complaint from Marline Nanzela over money paid to him in similar circumstances.






28.
He confirmed that he took an advance of Kshs20,000/= from the 1
st
 respondent out of which he only repaid Kshs5,000/= and the balance remains unpaid to date notwithstanding that he was supposed to settle the same by December, 2018. He admitted that he had attended at least three disciplinary hearings with the 2
nd
 respondent, two of which were about desertion of duty. He stated that he was aware and understood the charges against him.






29.
He stated that currently he is not teaching but he worked for the 2
nd
 respondent for over 25 years prior to the dismissal. He stated that he is familiar with the code of conduct and regulations of the 2
nd
 respondent. He confirmed that he worked at Afraha High School whereat he had interacted with one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1). He acknowledged that he was aware of the allegations that he had received money from Mr. Muyanzi. He further stated that when he joined Nakuru High School in 2018 he received money from parents for purchase of text books without the knowledge or authorization from the 1
st
 respondent.






30.
On cross-examination by counsel for the 2
nd
 respondent, the claimant stated that it is untrue that he was dismissed due to the complaints from the parents and alleged that he did not know the reasons for his removal. He stated that he did not know that there was a BOM meeting at the school on 6
th
 December, 2019, and he only came to know about it on 23
rd
 December, 2019 when he received the letter of interdiction.






31.
He admitted that according to Regulation 148 of the TSC regulations a teacher may be denied the half pay when on interdiction. He further admitted that that 2
nd
 respondent issued him with an amended letter of interdiction as provided for under Regulation 147 of the TSC Code of Regulations.






32.
He stated that he was not subjected to the disciplinary process in regard to the money that he received from parents and members of the public while teaching at Afraha High School. He stated that he was not charged in any criminal proceedings.






33.
In re-examination by his counsel, he stated that solicitation of money from one Merlin Zanzila was not one of the charges that he faced during the disciplinary hearing. He clarified that in 2018 he was not teaching at Afraha High School. He reiterated that he was not invited to the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019 and that he only learnt about the said meeting upon interdiction on 23
rd
 December, 2019. However, he admitted to soliciting and receiving money from one Samuel Muyanzi (RW1) and allegedly repaying it back while he was still a teacher at Afraha High School.






34.
It is on the basis on the foregoing evidence and circumstances that the claimant is seeking that judgment to be entered in his favour as prayed in the memorandum of claim. The submissions by his counsel shall be considered in a succeeding part of this judgment.








III. The Respondents’ Case


35.
The 1
st
 respondent’s position is contained in the response to the memorandum of claim filed on 14
th
 February, 2023 while the 2
nd
 respondent’s is as per the amended memorandum of response filed on 11
th
 November, 2022. The 2
nd
 respondent adduced its oral and documentary evidence through RW1, RW2, & RW3 while the 1
st
 respondent delivered its evidence through RW4.






36.
In the 1
st
 respondent’s response to the memorandum of claim it is contended that the claimant had on many occasions failed to carry out his duties diligently in breach of the 2
nd
 respondent’s code of conduct and ethics.






37.
It is pleaded that the claimant was served with an interdiction letter which was to take effect from 6
th
 December 2019 and subsequently served with a second letter of interdiction over the same allegations/charges.






38.
It is pleaded that the claimant was duly summoned to attend a disciplinary hearing scheduled for 2
nd
 December, 2019 which was rescheduled to 6
th
 December, 2019. It is further stated that the claimant was duly informed of the charges vide a letter dated 27
th
 November, 2019 yet the claimant deliberately failed to attend the disciplinary hearing.






39.
It is pleaded that the 1
st
 respondent acted in observance of Regulations 145, 146 (2) (a), 147 (1) and 149 of the Teachers Code of Conduct and Ethics 2015.






40.
In the 2
nd
 respondent’s amended memorandum of response it is admitted that the claimant was an employee of the 2
nd
 respondent. It is stated that the claimant was a graduate teacher and his last workstation was Nakuru Boys’ High School.






41.
It is contended that the claimant was bound to uphold the highest standards of professional ethics as a teacher as provided for in the code of conduct and ethics for teachers and other administrative circulars. It is stated that in or around January 2019, the claimant was made aware of allegations against him by the Principal Nakuru Boys’ High School about his misconduct in falsely obtaining financial assistance amounting to Kshs20,000/=, collecting money from parents and members of the public in the false pretences that he was capable of securing jobs for them or their children with the 2
nd
 respondent, soliciting for money, inciting staff against new school policies, and insubordination.






42.
It is pleaded that the claimant was issued with two show-cause letters dated 29
th
 April, 2019 and 2
nd
 September, 2019 respectively, and that he responded to both letters denying the said allegations. It is stated that the 1
st
 respondent convened an investigatory meeting on 6
th
 December, 2019 to accord the claimant an opportunity to respond to the allegations that faced him. Despite the claimant being invited to attend the said meeting, he failed to attend on the said date. It is pleaded that after reviewing the information presented the 1
st
 respondent resolved that the claimant be interdicted and the matter was forwarded to the 2
nd
 respondent for further action in accordance with the applicable regulations and the law.






43.
Subsequently, the claimant was issued with an amended letter of interdiction dated 25
th
 September, 2020 stating the allegations against him and calling upon him to defend himself in writing within 21 days. The claimant put in his defence on 27
th
 October, 2019 in response to the amended letter of interdiction.






44.
The claimant was invited to a disciplinary hearing on 24
th
 June, 2021 in accordance with the Code of Regulations for Teachers 2015 vide a letter dated 21
st
 May, 2021. It is pleaded that on 24
th
 June, 2021, the hearing proceeded virtually and the claimant was given an opportunity to defend himself. He was also given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness present.






45.
Subsequently, the disciplinary panel found the claimant guilty of the charges levelled against him and a decision was reached to dismiss the claimant from service. The 2
nd
 respondent communicated that decision to the claimant vide a letter dated 1
st
 July, 2021 and informed him of his right to seek for review or appeal within 90 days as per the Code of Regulations for Teachers.






46.
It is stated that the claimant appealed the decision vide a letter dated 17
th
 September, 2021 and he was invited for the hearing of the appeal on 3
rd
 March, 2022. The claimant appeared before the 2
nd
 respondent’s review committee and he was given an opportunity to argue his appeal. The review committee heard the claimant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the disciplinary panel dismissing the claimant from service and that decision was communicated to the claimant in a letter dated 9
th
 March, 2022.






47.
It is pleaded that the claimant was accorded a hearing in person throughout the entire disciplinary process as it can be discerned from the proceedings in accordance with Regulations 145, 146, 147 and 149 of the Code of Regulation for Teachers.






48.
Samuel Muyanzi (RW1), a businessman in Nakuru town, relied on and adopted his written statement dated 24
th
 October, 2022 together with the list of documents filed on 11
th
 November, 2022 as his evidence-in-chief. He stated that the claimant refunded to him the money he had paid to the claimant for his son to secure a job with the 2
nd
 respondent. He stated that subsequently his son was lawfully and regularly employed without any assistance from the claimant. He stated that he was refunded his money by the claimant after writing a letter on 23
rd
 January, 2019 by which time the claimant had joined Nakuru Boys’ High School. He had to pursue the claimant in his new school to demand for the refund.






49.
In cross-examination, he stated that in 2017, he gave Kshs30,000/= to the claimant but he could not remember whether he paid the claimant in cash or via Mpesa but his written statement indicates that he paid the claimant via Mpesa. The payment was made in the promise that the claimant was to facilitate the claimant secure a job for his son with the 2
nd
 respondent.






50.
RW2, Sammy Wakaba, a high school principal from Narok County, relied on and adopted his written statement dated 8
th
 November, 2022 as well as the list of documents filed as his evidence-in-chief.






51.
In cross-examination, he confirmed that in 2017 he was a deputy principal at Afraha High School, Nakuru County, and that the claimant was a geography teacher in the same school. He stated that there were several allegations and complaints raised against the claimant and a meeting was called. He stated that the BOM called a meeting but the claimant failed to attend and thereafter the claimant was transferred to St. Joseph’s Elburgon and later to Nakuru Boys’ High School.






52.
RW3, the 2
nd
 respondent’s deputy director, field services disciplinary division, relied on and adopted his written statement dated 24
th
 October, 2022 together with the list and bundle of documents dated 30
th
 September, 2022 which he produced and were marked as exhibits 1 to 20.






53.
In cross-examination, he stated that he primarily handles disciplinary matters for teachers, in accordance with the laid down procedures. He stated that a complaint against a teacher may be lodged by any person in writing. He stated that the complaints from the 1
st
 respondent came in by way of the letter of interdiction and the minutes of the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019.






54.
He elaborated on the disciplinary procedure to the effect that once a complaint is made, a show-cause letter is issued and then the matter is settled down for hearing. He stated that the show-cause letter against the claimant contained charges of insubordination and infamous conduct as elaborated elsewhere in this judgment. He confirmed that the minutes of the 1
st
 respondent’s staff meeting of 12
th
 April 2019 were not on record. He stated that the particulars of misconduct are clearly stated in the letter dated 2
nd
 September, 2019. He stated that after the show-cause letter is issued and served a teacher is given an opportunity to defend him/herself.






55.
He admitted that there is no evidence on record confirming that the notice inviting the claimant to the 1
st
 respondent’s meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019 actually reached him. However, the 2
nd
 respondent was served with a copy of the notice.






56.
He stated that the claimant was served with an interdiction letter from the 2
nd
 respondent dated 28
th
 January, 2020, which interdiction was backdated and took effect from 6
th
 December 2019.






57.
He stated that before the claimant was interdicted in 2018 his workstation was Afraha High School and thereafter he was transferred to St. Joseph Elburgon on 16
th
 June, 2018 before he joined Nakuru Boys’ High School in 2018. He stated that when on suspension a teacher cannot be allowed into the school’s premises. He stated that after interdiction, the claimant was invited for a hearing and the hearing was conducted virtually from the 2
nd
 respondent’s county director’s office, Nakuru. He stated that the claimant was dismissed and accordingly informed vide a letter dated 1
st
 July, 2021.






58.
RW4 was the chair of the 1
st
 respondent at the material time. In his testimony in court he relied on and adopted his written statement dated 8
th
 November, 2022. He produced the listed documents as exhibits 1 to 40.






59.
In cross-examination, he stated that a board of management (BOM), and the 1
st
 respondent is such one, deals with discipline of staff, management of physical structure, amongst many other functions. He stated that the principal is ordinarily the secretary to the BOM and initiates the disciplinary process by carrying out the investigation and presenting the same to the BOM for action and decision-making.






60.
He confirmed that the 1
st
 respondent held a disciplinary meeting on 6
th
 December, 2019 in regard to the alleged misconduct by claimant and he was present as a member. He confirmed that the claimant did not attend but the principal had informed the claimant of the meeting by inviting him through a letter followed with a phone call. He stated that the letter dated 13
th
 November, 2019 bears the claimant’s telephone number for ease of communication. He conceded that there was no evidence confirming that indeed the claimant was served with the said letter but the said meeting proceeded as scheduled on 6
th
 December, 2019. The claimant was accused of inciting staff, fraudulently obtaining money in guise of assisting desperate persons in securing employment with the 2
nd
 respondent, among other charges/allegations.






61.
It is on the basis on the foregoing evidence and circumstances that the respondents pray that the claimant’s cause be dismissed with costs. The submissions by the counsel for the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents shall be considered in the succeeding parts of this judgment alongside those by counsel for the claimant.








IV. Submissions By Counsel For The Claimant


62.
The claimant’s counsel identified the following three issues for determination - Whether the interdiction of the claimant by the 1
st
 respondent was lawful and procedural; Whether the claimant’s subsequent dismissal by the 2
nd
 respondent was lawful and procedural; and, Whether the claimant should be granted the orders sought.






63.
On the first issue, it is submitted that for a dismissal or termination to be fair and lawful it should pass the substantive and procedural fairness test. Counsel cited Section 41 of 
Employment Act
 (the Act) as well as the Regulations for Teachers 2015 (the Regulations) promulgated under the Teachers Code of Conduct and Ethics for Teachers (the Code). It is submitted that any complaint against a teacher shall be in writing in accordance with Regulation 145(1).






64.
It is submitted that the interdiction of the claimant followed a meeting held by the 1
st
 respondent on 6
th
 December, 2019 in the absence of the claimant as he had neither been served with the charges/allegations nor invited to the meeting. It is submitted that no formal complaint had been made against the claimant as required in the legal provisions cited above. Yet, it is further submitted, the respondents allege that there were charges of the claimant inciting staff in a meeting held on 12
th
 April, 2019, allegations of solicitation of money while the claimant was a teacher at Afraha High School in 2018, and for failing to repay a loan of Kshs20,000/= that was advanced to him by the school, and soliciting for money from students and members of the public.






65.
It is submitted that the allegations/charges against the claimant when he served at Afraha High School were not the subject of the disciplinary process and no complaints had been made against the claimant in writing. It is submitted that the respondents veered off the procedure when they considered extraneous matters for which no charges had been filed and for which the claimant had not been called to defend himself. In any event, it is submitted, the BOM Afraha High School is not a party in this cause.






66.
It is submitted that the respondents, and more so the 1
st
 respondent, failed to carry out proper investigation of the allegations and that is why no report was served upon the claimant and none was filed or availed in court during the trial of this cause. It is submitted that this casual approach by the respondents violated Regulations 144, 145, & 146(6) as well as the rules of natural justice.






67.
Counsel cited Mary Chemweno Kiptui V Kenya Pipeline Company LTD (2014) eKLR, Walter Anuro Ogaro V Teachers Service Commission (2013) eKLR, and Joseph Mwaniki Ng’ang’a V United Millers (2022) eKLR amongst other decisions in his assertion that the entire process as undertaken by the respondents was unfair and unlawful.






68.
On the second issue, it is submitted that having failed to comply with the provisions cited in the foregoing paragraphs the resultant dismissal of the claimant was wrongful, unfair, and illegal. It is submitted that the reason(s) for the interdiction and the procedure adopted were defective and as such the dismissal was unlawful. In that regard counsel cited Godfrey Khalitiba Lukorito V Teachers Service Commission (2019) eKLR.






69.
It is submitted that the dismissal was a nullity, ab initio, for lack of substance and the procedure was equally defective and unlawful. The court is reminded that the claimant was not charged with any crime notwithstanding all the unsubstantiated claims against him and no reports were made to the police yet Regulation 139(5) mandates the 2
nd
 respondent to work with law enforcement agencies where criminal conduct is alleged. Counsel has cited James Peterson Njeru V Teachers Service Commission (2017) eKLR in driving that point home.






70.
On reliefs, it is submitted that having been denied both substantive and procedural fairness the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the memo of claim. Again, counsel has urged the court to be persuaded by the reasoning in Godfrey Khalitaba Lukorito V Teachers Service Commission (Supra).








V. Submissions By Counsel For The 1st Respondent


71.
The counsel for the 1
st
 respondent identified the following three issues for determination - Whether the claimant’s interdiction and subsequent disciplinary hearing was lawful; Whether the claimant should be granted the reliefs sought; and, whether the claim offends the provisions of section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 on the burden of proof.






72.
On the first issue, it is submitted that the claimant was interdicted on various counts of gross misconduct. The charges/allegations included inciting members of staff in a staff meeting, collecting money from unsuspecting parents and members of the public in guise that he could secure employment for them with the 2
nd
 respondent, failure to repay money advanced to him by the school, and failure to execute his duties diligently and in accordance with the Code and Regulations. It is submitted that the respondents complied with the law in conducting the entire process culminating in the dismissal of the claimant.






73.
It is submitted that under Section 20 of the 
Teachers Service Commission Act
 the 2
nd
 respondent may generally or in particular delegate its mandate or part thereof to a committee, member, officer, staff, or agent in exercise of any of its functions and duties under the said law. It is submitted that it is on the basis and strength of the above law that the 1
st
 respondent carried the investigations, conducted the disciplinary hearing, and issued an interdiction letter to the claimant in accordance with Regulations 146(2)(a) & 147(1). It is submitted that the claimant was informed of the disciplinary meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019 but he deliberately failed to attend the hearing. Counsel cited Jennifer Osodo V Teachers Service Commission (2013) eKLR in advancing the argument that a teacher should not hold the 1
st
 respondent at ramson by insisting that disciplinary proceedings be conducted at the convenience an employee.






74.
It is submitted that in any event the interdiction was only a preliminary step in the entire disciplinary process and the claimant was afforded full and fair hearing in accordance with the Code and Regulations. Counsel cited Judicial Service Commission V Gladys Boss Shollei & Another in emphasizing that when considered in its entirety the disciplinary process against the claimant was fair, just, and lawful as the claimant was given a fair hearing in accordance with the law, the Code, and the Regulations.






75.
On the second issue, it is submitted that the claimant is not entitled to the reliefs sought as the dismissal was fair and lawful. It is submitted that in National Bank of Kenya V Samuel Nguru Mutonya (2019) eKLR the Court of Appeal held that the reliefs provided for under Section 49 of the Act are discretionary not mandatory.






76.
On the third issue, it is submitted that the claimant failed to prove his claim hence offending Sections 107 & 112 of the 
Evidence Act
. In that regard the court is urged to follow the reasoning in Leonard Otieno V Airtel Kenya Limited (2018) eKLR & David Githinji Kibuge V New Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd (2019) eKLR.






77.
The court is urged to dismiss the claim with costs for all the reasons alluded to above.








VI. Submissions By Counsel For The 2Nd Respondent


78.
The 2
nd
 respondent’s counsel identified the following three issues for determination- Whether the claimant was dismissed on reasonable grounds; Whether the due process for dismissal was followed; and, Whether the claimant is entitled to the prayers sought.






79.
On the first issue, it is submitted that the claimant was fairly and lawfully dismissed for infamous conduct after due process. It is submitted that the respondents had good and reasonable grounds in taking the disciplinary action all the way to the dismissal. It is submitted that based on the information and the allegations made against the claimant the respondents took the right action under Section 43 of the Act based on genuine believe and reasonable grounds of the alleged misconduct. It is submitted that based on Section 33 of the 
Teachers Service Commission Act
 & Regulation 146 of the Code the 2
nd
 respondent investigated the allegations against the claimant as provided by the 1
st
 respondent from the latter’s meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019, and found substance to escalate the matter to hearing.






80.
It is submitted that the 2
nd
 respondent, the employer, genuinely believed the allegations against the claimant, including the fact that the claimant had admitted refunding money to RW1 which money he had obtained with false pretences and or fraudulently. It is submitted that the above victim testified in this trial and indeed confirmed that the claimant had obtained a sum of Kshs30,000/= in the guise that he could secure employment with the 2
nd
 respondent for the victim’s son. The evidence on record is that the claimant subsequently refunded the money.






81.
It is submitted that the claimant admitted in the trial that he borrowed a sum of Kshs20,000/= from the 1
st
 respondent which he failed, refused, and or neglected to repay. He also admitted receiving money from parents to allegedly purchase text books for the leaners outside the established official structure of school fees. It is submitted that based on the evidence availed the respondents took the appropriate action culminating in the fair and lawful dismissal of the claimant.






82.
Further, it is submitted that the claimant failed to prove that the dismissal was unfair and unlawful under Section 47(5) of the Act. Counsel cited Reuben Ikatwa & 17 Others V Commanding Officer British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) (unreported) & Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited (2017) eKLR among other decisions on this point.






83.
It is submitted that on a balance of probabilities the claimant failed to prove his cause while the respondents demonstrated that there were good and sound grounds for taking the disciplinary action based on genuine believe and indeed proved gross misconduct and infamous conduct on the part of the claimant.






84.
On due process, it is submitted that the respondents complied with Part XI of the Code, the Act, and Rules of natural justice. It is submitted that the claimant was issued with a show-cause letter spelling out the specific charges/allegations against him and he was given an opportunity to defend himself.






85.
It is submitted that while the original allegations related to the misconduct of the claimant while serving at Nakuru Boys’ High School, to wit incitement of staff, soliciting for funds from parents, and failing to repay the money advanced to him, it was subsequently discovered that the claimant had other serious and gross misconduct while serving at Afraha High School relating to fraudulently obtaining money in the guise of securing jobs with the 2
nd
 respondent for desperate job-seekers. It is submitted that the case of RW1 alluded to above is a clear case of gross misconduct and the claimant admitted to the same.






86.
It is submitted that the evidence on record proves that the claimant was issued with a show-cause letter, investigation was carried out, interdiction served, defence to the allegations filed, invitation to the hearing served, disciplinary hearing held, and a lawful decision arrived at based on the evidence adduced. The decision of dismissal was promptly communicated to the claimant. The court is urged to find that the respondents subjected the claimant to due process and as such to uphold the decision reached. It is submitted that upon filing his appeal /review dated 17
th
 September, 2022 the claimant was invited to argue and he indeed argued his appeal at length on 24
th
 February, 2022. The appeal was considered on merit but the dismissal was upheld.






87.
It is submitted that considering the entire circumstances in this cause the claimant was afforded both substantive and procedural fairness and the court is urged to uphold the dismissal. Counsel cited Judicial Service Commission V Gladys Boss Shollei & Another (Supra) to the effect that due process need not be so elaborate as demanded of a trial in court and that as long as the basic rules and tenets of natural justice are complied with the process should be deemed adequate and satisfactory.






88.
On reliefs, the court is urged to find that since the dismissal was fair and lawful the claimant is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought. It is submitted that in view of his demonstrated infamous conduct and gross misconduct the 2
nd
 respondent lost trust and confidence in the claimant and it is inconceivable that the claimant is seeking reinstatement yet he was the author of his own misfortune. It is submitted that the claimant is not a good example to the learners in view of his corrupt and unprofessional conduct.






89.
Further, it is submitted that since the dismissal was fair and lawful the issue of compensation does not arise. In any event, it is submitted, the claimant failed to prove that he was entitled to such compensation including gratuity which was in any event not provided for in his contract of service. As if a reminder was needed, the court is urged not to be driven by sympathy but by justice and consider the interests of both parties in the entire circumstances of this cause.








VII. Issues For Determination


90.
The court has carefully and dutifully gone through the pleadings filed, the oral and documentary evidence presented from all the parties, and the written submissions by counsel for all the parties. In the considered view of the court the following issues commend themselves for determination: -
a.
Was the dismissal of the claimant wrongful, unfair, and unlawful?
b.
If (a) above is in the affirmative, is the claimant entitled to the reliefs sought? And,
c.
Costs?








VIII. Substantive Justification And Procedural Fairness


91.
The jurisprudence on what constitutes unfair and unlawful termination and wrongful dismissal is somehow now settled. Besides the employer establishing a good reason for the termination or dismissal (substantive fairness) it has to be established that the employee was afforded and granted a hearing to defend himself against any allegations or charges levelled against him/her (procedural fairness). The substantive and the procedural fairness are what is collectively referred to as due process – See Mary Chemweno V Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (2017) eKLR, Loice Otieno V Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (2013) eKLR, and Walter Ogal Anuro V Teachers Service Commission (2012) eKLR.






92.
Without the necessity of repeating the analysis of the evidence availed, which has been so well analysed by counsel for the parties in their respective written submissions as summarized above, the court shall weigh the facts, evidence, and circumstances of this cause against the test stated above – substantive and procedural fairness – in determining whether the dismissal was unfair and unlawful as pleaded and prayed by the claimant.






93.
Vide a letter dated 1
st
 September, 1994 the 2
nd
 respondent engaged the claimant as a graduate teacher on the terms and conditions set out therein and his appointment was confirmed on 7
th
 October, 1996. The claimant thereafter served in several schools including Afraha High School, St. Joseph’s Elburgon, and Nakuru Boys’ High School, the latter being his last station before dismissal vide a letter dated 1
st
 July, 2021.






94.
The claimant joined Nakuru Boys’ High School on 27
th
 August, 2018 as confirmed in a letter dated 7
th
 September, 2018 as per the letters that he exhibited in court.






95.
In a meeting held by the 1
st
 respondent on 6
th
 December, 2019, whose minutes were exhibited in the trial by the claimant, the conduct of the claimant was discussed. It was alleged that he had failed to refund or repay a sum of Kshs20,000/= that he had borrowed from the school; and, that RW1 had written to the principal of the school to the effect that the claimant had conned or fraudulently obtained from him a sum of Kshs30,000/= when the claimant was a teacher at Afraha High School in the guise that he would secure a job with the 2
nd
 respondent for the son of the victim. It is stated in the said minutes that the claimant had admitted to the misconduct and undertaken to refund the money. A similar complaint had been made by one Kogo Kipng’etich Noah. Further, it was alleged that the claimant had on several occasions incited members of staff against the administration and one such incident was cited to have occurred during a staff meeting held on 12
th
 April, 2019. It was also alleged that the claimant had been asking for and receiving money from parents to allegedly purchase books for learners without the knowledge and or approval by the school administration. It was also alleged that he had received money from parents in the promise of securing admission of their children to the school.






96.
The letters of complaint by the persons named above were exhibited and produced as exhibits by the 2
nd
 respondent. In my considered view those letters constituted the written complaints against the claimant.






97.
It was alleged that the claimant had been informed of the foregoing allegations and charges but no evidence was availed to prove that indeed the claimant had been informed of the charges and or invited to the meeting held on 6
th
 December, 2019. The letter dated 13
th
 November, 2019 inviting the claimant to the meeting and informing him of the charges bears no evidence that the claimant was served with the same.






98.
However, the court notes that the claimant filed the said letter as an exhibit in his bundle of documents and no explanation was offered as to how he obtained the same if the same had not been served upon him.






99.
Subsequent to the above meeting, the claimant was served with two undated letters of interdiction. In his evidence, the claimant admitted that he was served with the said letters on or about 23
rd
 December, 2019. The interdiction took effect from 6
th
 December, 2019. The claimant was accused of insubordination, incitement of staff, solicitation of funds, obtaining funds from parents, as stated in the minutes alluded to above, and he was invited to respond thereto in writing.






100.
The court has seen the response/defence by the claimant dated 25
th
 December, 2019 in which he denied the charges and allegations levelled against him.






101.
As required by the Code and the Regulations, the 1
st
 respondent escalated the matter to the 2
nd
 respondent and in a letter dated 28
th
 September, 2020 the claimant was interdicted by his employer in line with Regulation 146. The letter reiterated the charges and enumerated them as per the minutes of the meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019, and the letter of interdiction earlier on issued by the 1
st
 respondent. The claimant was invited to respond to the charges/allegations in writing and avail any evidence or defence that he had. As noted above, the claimant filed his amended response in the letter dated 25
th
 December, 2019 following the initial interdiction by the 1
st
 respondent.






102.
The court finds and holds that even if the claimant was not invited to the meeting of 6
th
 December, 2019, by the 1
st
 respondent, which is however in doubt as he readily filed in court the letter inviting him, such defect in the process was cured and rectified when he was served afresh by the 2
nd
 respondent and invited to defend himself and to attend the disciplinary hearing.






103.
In a letter dated 21
st
 May, 2021 the claimant was invited for a virtual hearing of his disciplinary case on 24
th
 June, 2021 which hearing was to take place in the 2
nd
 respondent’s county director’s office at Nakuru. For ease of reference the said letter provided as follows –

th
 December, 2019, I am directed to inform you that, your case will be heard virtually on 24

104.
The proceedings of the disciplinary hearing were exhibited and produced by the 1
st
 respondent capturing the entire hearing. Ultimately, a decision was made that the claimant be dismissed from service of the 2
nd
 respondent. The decision was communicated to the claimant in a letter dated 1
st
 July, 2021.






105.
Dissatisfied with the decision to dismiss him, the claimant appealed vide a letter dated 17
th
 September, 2019. The appeal/review was considered on 3
rd
 March, 2022 and the minutes indicate that the claimant attended the hearing and he argued his case extensively.






106.
However, the dismissal was upheld and the claimant was accordingly informed vide a letter dated 9
th
 March, 2022.






107.
Of course, it is in the backdrop of the above background that the claimant filed this cause in court on 4
th
 October, 2022 seeking for the reliefs alluded to in the introductory part of this judgment. For avoidance of doubt, the time of three years within which the claimant was to file his claim in court started running on the date when the appeal process concluded and the claimant informed of the outcome on 9
th
 March, 2022.






108.
It is the finding and holding of this court that the employer, the 2
nd
 respondent, had genuine and reasonable grounds upon which to found disciplinary action against the claimant. Section 43(2) of the Act sets out a subjective test upon which an employer decides on whether to take disciplinary action against an employee. So long as the employer genuinely and reasonably believed that the alleged and disclosed misconduct or that the circumstances thereof disclosed misconduct, the employer had good and sound grounds to act.






109.
This court (ELRC) has to warn itself not to trespass into the arena of human resources management at the workplace as that should be the province and within the purview of an employer. Unless there is established illegalities or irregularities, the court should not and shall not intervene or interfere with and in the human resources management at the workplace.






200.
The claimant was accused of gross misconduct and or infamous conduct as set out in the show-cause letter. The details thereof were supplied right from the level where the matter was handled by 1
st
 respondent to the level when the matter was escalated to the 2
nd
 respondent. The charges, in my view, as enumerated elsewhere in this judgment, were gross and grave.






201.
The allegation and claim by the claimant that he was charged with misconduct that did not occur while serving at Nakuru Boys’ High School but at Afraha High School is, to say the least, escapist and naïve. At all material times the claimant was an employee of the 2
nd
 respondent regardless of the school wherein he was teaching. In any event, the claimant’s proved misconduct while at Afraha High School followed him to Nakuru Boys’ High School. Suffice to say that all the charges against the claimant at whatever locus committed were laid out to him and he was called upon to defend himself.






202.
In my considered view, on the basis of the charges/allegations against the claimant, the respondents acted fairly and lawfully in pursuing disciplinary action against him in the genuine belief that the claimant had violated the law, the Regulations, and the Code. In terms of substance, in my considered view, the respondents complied with the law and more so Sections 43 & 45 of the Act.






203.
The claimant in his evidence admitted receiving and failing to repay the sum of Kshs20,000/= to the 1
st
 respondent, he also admitted in cross-examination that he had received money from RW1 as charged and that he had refunded the same. He also admitted asking for money from parents to allegedly buy textbooks for learners outside the established school fees structure and without the knowledge and or approval from the 1
st
 respondent. It does not matter that the claimant was not charged in a criminal court. Besides the provisions in the Regulations and the Code as cited by counsel for the respondents the claimant also violated Section 44(4)(g) of the Act.






204.
In terms of the procedure adopted, the court finds and holds that the claimant was informed of the charges and the particulars thereof, he was served with a show-cause letter and given a chance to respond thereto in writing, and he was invited for a hearing and informed of his right to bring his evidence and even call witnesses. He attended the hearing in person and as per the minutes was heard and afforded due process. The decision to dismiss him was promptly communicated to him and he was informed of his right of appeal/review which he exercised. Upon rejection of his appeal and upholding of the dismissal, the claimant was promptly informed of that outcome.






205.
With all due respect to the claimant and his counsel, the court finds and holds that the claimant was heard and due process accorded to him. The court finds no reason to fault the substantive and procedural steps as undertaken and executed by the respondents.






206.
For all the above reasons, the court upholds the dismissal and hereby declares and proclaims so. The court takes this position based on the facts and evidence adduced and presented in court in full cognizance of the fact that the claimant is a person living with a disability having appeared in the physical court to give his testimony and also tendering documentary evidence of his disability. There is no evidence of discrimination whatsoever as the claimant alleged in his evidence in court.






207.
The claimant is the author of his own misfortune for the path of self-destruction that he chose. He confirmed that he is well informed in the regulations and ethical dictates of his profession. As much as the court may be empathetic of the claimant and his condition, the facts and evidence in this court portrays the claimant as a person on a mission of self-destruction. I hope he learns from the experience of this matter and picks himself up towards a better future.






208.
For all the foregoing reasons, the claimant’s cause is hereby dismissed.








IX. Orders


209.
The claimant’s cause is hereby dismissed in its entirety with no order as to costs.

Between




Fred Chepkwony


 


Appellant




and




Protective Custody Limited


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the ruling and order of the Senior Resident Magistrate (Hon E. S. Soita) delivered on 27th June, 2023, in Nakuru CMCC (ELRC) No. E229 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










I. Introduction


1.
The appellant herein (the claimant in the lower court) commenced Nakuru CMCC (ELRC) No. E229 of 2021 by way of a plaint dated 21
st
 December, 2022 filed through Maragia Ogaro & Co. Advocates, claiming the following –
a.
Notice Pay
b.
Overtime
c.
Underpayment
d.
Off duties
e.
Public Holidays
f.
Leave
g.
Compensation
h.
Certificate of service






2.
The memorandum of claim was accompanied with a verifying affidavit and a list of one witness, the claimant. No list or bundle of documents was filed.






3.
The claimant pleaded that he was engaged by the respondent as a day-guard in June, 2018 but he was allegedly unfairly and unlawfully terminated on 12
th
 July, 2020. He did not plead or mention that there existed a written contract of employment or a letter of appointment between himself and the respondent.






4.
Once served with the summons, the respondent entered appearance on 31
st
 January, 2023. On 8
th
 February, 2023 the respondent filed a chamber summons dated 2
nd
 February, 2023 seeking the following orders –
1.
The cause filed herein be stayed and the dispute be referred to Arbitration in accordance with the Agreement of the parties as set out in the Appointment Letter dated 1
st
 January 2022.
2.
The costs of this application be borne by the claimant.






5.
Annexed to the supporting affidavit to the application is a purported letter of appointment allegedly executed between the parties herein which is alleged to be the contract of employment between the claimant and the respondent. The letter was allegedly executed by the parties on 1
st
 January, 2022.






6.
The contention by the respondent is that clause 7 of the said letter of appointment/contract provided that any dispute(s) relating to the employment relationship created between the parties is to be referred to arbitration for adjudication.






7.
In his replying affidavit to the application the appellant disowned the said letter of appointment/contract and vehemently denied ever executing the same. He refers to the document as a forgery and fraudulent.






8.
It is important to note that to this day the respondent has not filed a response/defence to the claim. This fact has a significant effect on the proceedings as shall be noted hereunder.






9.
In a ruling delivered on and dated 27
th
 June, 2023, the trial lower court issued the following orders –
a.
The court has no jurisdiction in this claim.
b.
The claim in struck out with no orders as to cost.






10.
This appeal is against the above ruling and orders and the appellant has raised the following grounds in the memorandum of appeal dated 24
th
 February, 2023 –
1.
That the learned trial magistrate court erred in law and in fact in granting the prayers that were not sought by the Respondent in the respondent’s application dated 2.2.2023.
2.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note and take cognizance of the fact that the Appellant had denounced in whole the purported Appointment Letter that the Respondent had alleged that it was signed by the Appellant.
3.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to address valid questions and issues that were raised in the said Appointment Letter.
4.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the respondent who had propagated the question of “Reference to Arbitration” failed to refer the matter to Arbitration and or initiate the said process but opted to wait for the claimant to lodge the dispute in court for it to raise the issue of Arbitration. This casted doubt and faith to the authenticity of the purported Appointment Letter.
5.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the Employment and Labour Court under Article 162(2)(a) of 
the Constitution
 is clothed with original and exclusive jurisdiction as read with the provision of Section 87 of the 
Employment Act
.
6.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the Arbitration does not have the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine a dispute and especially the reliefs that were sought the Appellant given that the said reliefs are anchored under the numerous Section of the 
Employment Act
, 
Labour Institutions Act
 and the Wages Order which clothes and guides the Employment and Labour Court with clear tabulation mechanisms.
7.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the submission filed on behalf of the Appellant then claimant.
8.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the subject clause (that is Clause 7 of the purported Appointment Letter) failed to meet the authentic test in that it only compelled the Employee to subject himself or herself to the whims of the Employers Board and if not, be subjected to the Arbitration Process for which the Employee has no easy access as is the Employment and Labour Relations Court.
9.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to note that the subject Clause had excluded the Appellant or any employee the initial access to the Employees Union or Representative, thus the said Clause cannot override the powers of the Employment and Labour Relations Court to hear and determine disputes emanating from unlawful termination.
10.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in delivering a Ruling that was and will remain oppressive, wanting in law and logic, tilting to one side of the divide and biased in fairness.






11.
On 15
th
 November, 2023 the court directed that the appeal be canvassed by way of written submissions. Mr. Maragia for the appellant filed his written submissions on 14
th
 November, 2023, while Miss Kinoti for the respondent filed on 29
th
 November, 2023. With the leave of the court, Mr. Maragia for the appellant filed supplementary submissions on 13
th
 December, 2023.








II. Submissions By Counsel


12.
On the one hand, counsel for the appellant identified the following issues for determination –
i.
Whether the court acted erroneously in holding that the claimant had agreed and or had submitted himself to the Arbitration by reference to the clause in the Appointment Letter that the claimant questioned.
ii.
Whether from the content of purported Appointment Letter, the claimant had no option but have the matter referred to Arbitration even on sight of the falsities pointed out by the claimant and steps taken by respondent.
iii.
Whether the claimant contested the purported Letter of Appointment and if the court ignored the said contestation raised by the claimant
iv.
Whether the court lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause arising from termination in terms of Section 87 of the Employment vis-a-vis Article 162(2)(a) of 
Constitution of Kenya, 2010
 on the one hand and the provision of the Appointment Letter vis-à-vis the provision of Section 4 of the 
Arbitration Act
.






13.
On the first issue, it is submitted that the lower court ignored the fact that the appellant contested, opposed, and denied the purported letter of appointment/contract and that the appellant denied signing and or thumbprinting the same. It is submitted that the lower court misdirected itself and went against the evidence on record when it ruled and held that the appellant had not denied executing and or thumbprinting the said document. It is submitted that the appellant was extremely categorical in his replying affidavit that he neither signed nor thumb-printed on the alleged document and as such his position is that the same is a forgery intended to mislead the court and that the lower court fell into the trap.






14.
In the foregoing circumstances, counsel submits, there was no agreement and or consent between the parties that any dispute in regard to their employment relationship was to be arbitrated.






15.
Further, it is submitted that the appellant, as per his claim, was engaged by the respondent in June, 2018 and terminated in July, 2020. Yet, the contract is alleged to have been executed in January, 2022, long after the appellant had been terminated. It is submitted that the above facts and evidence abundantly demonstrate that the alleged letter of appointment/contract is a forgery and fraudulent and the trial lower court gravely erred in its ruling by holding otherwise.






16.
It is submitted that the subject matter of the claim is an employment dispute that properly lies within the jurisdiction of a court with jurisdiction over such matters and the trial lower court was properly seized of the matter but misdirected itself in holding and denying its jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. Counsel has cited Section 87 of the 
Employment Act
 (the Act) in support of the jurisdiction of the court.






17.
It is submitted that the parties in their relationship did not invoke or subject themselves to the 
Arbitration Act
 as no such jurisdiction was expressly or otherwise implied in the terms and conditions of service.






18.
On the other hand, counsel for the respondent identified two issues for determination – Whether there is a valid arbitration clause; and, Whether the trial court has jurisdiction over the subject matter.






19.
On the first issue, counsel relied on the disputed letter of appointment/contract submitting that going by the same the parties agreed and consented to arbitration in case of a dispute. Counsel has submitted extensively on the extent to which arbitration clauses in contracts bind parties and cited several authorities on the same. For reasons that shall become clear in a moment, the court shall not engage in analyzing the submission by counsel from that angle.






20.
On the second issue, counsel submitted along the same line of thought that once the parties consented to the arbitration clause in the alleged but disputed contract the jurisdiction of the court was ousted. Again, the court shall desist in interrogating the issue at this point but deal with the same in the succeeding parts of the determination.






21.
The court is urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.






22.
In the supplementary submissions, counsel for the appellant reiterated the position taken in the initial submissions. It is submitted that since the letter of appointment/contract is disputed the trial court made a grave error in relying on the same and arriving at the decision that it did - striking out the appellant’s case in the most draconian and unfair manner.






23.
The court is urged to allow the appeal with costs.








III. Issues For Determination


24.
The court has carefully gone through the memorandum of appeal and the written submissions by counsel for both parties. In my comprehensive understanding of the issues raised in the memorandum of appeal and upon reading the ruling/order that gave rise to the appeal, the learned trial magistrate struck out the suit on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter.






25.
It is important to note and state that striking out of the suit is not one of the prayers that the respondent had sought in the application. What was sought in the application was for stay of the proceedings pending referral to and determination of the matter on arbitration.






26.
The following issues commend themselves for determination –
a.
Is there a proved and accepted letter of appointment/contract of employment between the parties wherein arbitration was agreed as the method of resolving any dispute(s) arising therefrom hence ousting the jurisdiction of the court?
b.
Depending on the outcome of issue (a) above, what are the appropriate orders for this court to make?
c.
Costs.






27.
The answer to issue (a) above is fairly straightforward. As noted elsewhere in this judgment, the appellant did not plead or allude to a letter of appointment or a written contract between him and the respondent. It is the respondent who introduced an alleged letter of appointment and only did so by way of an application. To this point, and the record confirms this, the respondent has not filed a defence or a response to the claim. Had a response or a defence been filed, the appellant should have had an opportunity to respond thereto.






28.
Be that as it may, the impugned letter of appointment is vehemently denied and opposed by the appellant. The court notes that the page allegedly executed by the parties is separate from the other part of the document. The first page is not signed or initialed by the parties. Contrary to what the counsel for the respondent alleges, it is the respondent who introduced the document into the proceedings and hence bore the burden of proving that indeed the same is genuine, more so, when the appellant disputed the same.






29.
Under Sections 10 and 74 of the 
Employment Act
 it is the duty and obligation of the employer, the respondent, to keep records of employment and as such it is the employer who bears the burden of proving their authenticity. The court finds and holds that under Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 the burden of proof into the authenticity and genuineness of the said document lies with the respondent.






30.
However, the required proof may only be achieved in a trial where the document is introduced as an exhibit and challenged for the court to determine its authenticity, genuineness, and admissibility in evidence. As it stands now, there is no evidence that the appellant executed the same as alleged by the respondent through an application. As far as I understand the appellant’s case in the lower court, his position is that there was no written contract or letter of appointment issued to him.






31.
Further, the appellant states that the letter of appointment reads that it was executed in January, 2022, long after he had been terminated. This is one of the reasons that the appellant termed the document a forgery and hence fraudulent.






32.
In my considered view, it was wrong, erroneous, and misleading for the lower court to rely on a contested document, which in any event had not been produced as an exhibit, to make such final and draconian orders against the appellant. Striking out a cause or suit is so draconian and should only be applied in the most obvious and clear circumstances.






33.
The respondent did not file and has not filed a defence or response to the claim; the contested document has not even been listed as one of those that the respondent shall be relying on during the trial; the appellant has not had the opportunity of responding to the expected defence; the impugned document is contested and the same has not been produced and admitted in evidence as an exhibit.






34.
In the foregoing circumstances, it was misleading, premature, prejudicial, erroneous, and wrong for the trial lower court to have relied on the said document to strike out the cause. The court denied the appellant a right to be heard as envisaged under Articles 47 & 50 of 
the Constitution
.






35.
The multitude of cases cited by counsel is irrelevant at this stage. The appellant contested the impugned document and termed it a forgery and fraudulent. The trial court ought to have proceeded with the trial and allowed the parties to contest the document in the trial. The lower court wrongfully and unlawfully shifted the burden to the appellant to disapprove the authenticity and genuineness of a document that had not been, in the first place, produced as an exhibit.






36.
Further, the order of striking out the suit was not one of those sought by the respondent. The prayer sought was for stay of proceedings pending the arbitration process. Again, the trial court was too enthusiastic in striking out the cause which I find hasty and prejudicial to the appellant. Even if the lower court were to find, in a trial properly conducted, that the contested document was genuine, it ought to stay the proceedings and the parties directed to commence the arbitration.






37.
In answer to issue one, therefore, the court returns that so far there is no evidence of a binding letter of appointment/contract that demands that the parties refer the subject matter for arbitration. This is so because there is no such document on record properly produced in the trial. Further, the document that has been alluded to by the respondent in the application has been contested and denied by the appellant. The contest over the document may only be settled in a properly conducted trial.






38.
For all the foregoing reasons, therefore, the appeal is allowed and the court orders that the suit in the lower court be and is hereby reinstated to be heard by a magistrate, other than Hon. E. Soita, to its logical conclusion.






39.
The appellant is awarded the costs of the appeal.








IV. Orders


40.
In allowing the appeal, the court issues the following orders -
a.
The order of the lower trial court striking out the suit for purported want of jurisdiction be is hereby set aside and the suit is reinstated for hearing on merits to logical conclusion.
b.
The suit shall now be heard on merits by any other magistrate, other than Hon. Mr. E. Soita (SRM), to its logical conclusion.
c.
The appellant is awarded the costs of the appeal and those of the application in the lower court.

Judgment










1.
The Appellant was charged in the Chief Magistrate’s court at Kakamega , with 7 others, of a number of offences under the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003. The Appellant herein was charged with three counts.






2.
On count 1 , he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the law relating to management of funds and incurring of expenditure contrary to section 45(2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act, 2003. On count 2 he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the law relating to the management of funds and incurring of expenditures contrary to section 45(2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003; and on count 3 he was charged with wilful failure to comply with the Applicable procedures and guidelines relating to procurement and tendering of contracts contrary to section 45(9) (2) (b) as read with section 48(1) of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act , 2003.






3.
He was convicted of the first two counts and fined ksh. 400,000 on each count or 2 years imprisonment in default.






Memorandum of Appeal


4.
Aggrieved by the judgment , he proffered this Appeal and set out the following grounds.
1.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering that at the time the case was brought against the appellant the ethics and Anti-corruption commission was not properly constituted.
2.
The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in not considering the fact that the report and recommendations of the DPP were forwarded when the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was not properly constituted.
3.
The judgment passed by the trial court is against the law, incorrect and inconsistent.
4.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in ignoring the contradictions of the prosecution witnesses and in particular on whether or not members of the inspection and acceptance committee conducted a market survey.
5.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in basing his decision to convict the appellant on the pronouncement of a valuation report prepared and uttered by unqualified persons and hence gave force to as documentary evidence, a document that is of no evidentiary value.
6.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in arriving at his verdict based on facts that were not part to the charges read to the appellant and which facts to the charges read to the appellant and which facts therefore he could not be called upon to answer to.
7.
The learned magistrate erred by giving weightage to the procedures of direct procurement while the charges the appellants were called upon to answer to had no relation to direct procurement.
8.
The learned trial magistrate erred in failing to read and consider the law as a whole and erred in holding that the findings of the evaluation committee was legally and absolutely binding and without room for discretion on the part of the appellants and particularly the procurement unit.
9.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law at failing completely to address the constitutionality of the arrest and prosecution of the appellant by failing to appreciate the fact that the investigations having been conducted during the absence of a duly constituted commission were in breach of the constitutional provisions which rendered both the investigations as well as the resultant recommendations to prosecute a nullity.
10.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in holding that the items or equipment were ordinarily available in the market thereby contradicting his own finding that the equipment had been prefabricated.
11.
The learned magistrate erred in failing to appreciate that in the entire hearing no evidence was adduced of criminal intent as imported by the word wilfully in the charges and hence imputed without proof.
12.
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in placing reliance while convicting the appellant on case law that were civil in nature thereby in effect convicting on standard of proof to a balance of probability rather than beyond reasonable doubt.
13.
The learned magistrate failed to take into account the evidence in totality mitigating circumstances and elimination of extraneous considerations and pressure while passing the sentence.






5.
The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions .








Appellant’s submissions


6.
The Appellant presented the following issues for consideration:
a).
Whether the ethics and anti-corruption commission was properly constituted at the time investigations were conducted by the EACC and whether the resultant recommendation to prosecute the appellants was a nullity.
b).
Whether the prosecution met its burden and proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
c).
Whether the elements of the crime as set out under section 45 (2) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic 
Act No. 3 of 2003
 were established.
d).
Whether the sentence imposed was too harsh and excessive.






7.
On whether the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission ( EACC) was properly constituted, the appellant submits that EACC did not have commissioners between the month of May 2015 and January 2016. That the last commissioner to leave office resigned on may 2015 , while the new ones were sworn into office on 23
rd
 January 2016.






8.
It is pointed out that according to the investigations officer who testified during trial, the recording of statements, the collection of exhibits and the commencement of the prosecution, took place when there were no commissioners in the office.






9.
The Appellant further argues that , it follows that the evidence collected during that period were null and void , rendering the entire trial a nullity. In this regard the Appellant has relied on the court of Appeal decision in the case of Michael Sistu Mwaura vs EACC& 4 others ( 2017) e KLR where the court of Appeal held that investigations and recommendations to Director of public prosecutions(DPP) must be authorized and sanctioned by the EACC commissioners.






10.
It is further submitted that looking at the core mandate of EACC the work of sanctioning investigation and making recommendations to DPP belongs to EACC as a corporate entity , who are required to exercise oversight over the secretariat and that there is nothing in the EACC Act that allows the EACC secretariat to pass by the commissioners in their recommendations.






11.
According to the appellant, upon the completion of an investigation, the commissioners are the ones responsible for reporting to the ODPP the reports of the investigations and making appropriate recommendation.






12.
The Appellant has further relied on the high court decision in Kakamega Criminal Appeal No. 90 of 2018 Ayub Tuvaka China and 4 others versus Republic where Justice Njagi pronounced himself on the commencement of investigation where the EACC commissioners were not constituted at the time the investigation began. In the said decision the Appellants were charged together with the Appellant herein at the chief magistrates court and the Appeal was against the same decision.






13.
The Appellant has finally relied on another high court decision in 
Busia County Government versus Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Milimani Constitutional petition No. 382 of 2015
 (d2016) eKLR where the Justice Onguto held that though the absence of the commission did not render the EACC extinct, the EACC had no powers in the absence of the commissioners, to initiate investigations on its own motion.






14.
The decisions in the cases of 
Robert Cheruiyot vs. Republic Nakuru HCCRA No.3 of 2017
 and John Mwangi Maina & 2 others versus Republic (2018) and Gabriel Mburu Irungu vs. Republic were also relied on.








Respondent submissions.


15.
The Respondent filed its submissions on 16
th
 January 2023, in which it confined itself to the issue of the late filing of the Appeal. The respondent further submitted that save for the issue of the time bar , they are not opposed to the Appeal.








Determination


16.
This is a first Appeal and the mandate of this court is well settled . In the case of Odhiambo =versus= Republic (2005)eKLR the court of Appeal held ‘’On a first appeal the court is mandated to look at the evidence adduced before trial afresh, re-evaluate and re-asses it and reach its own independent conclusions. However it must warn itself that it did not have the benefit of seeing the witnesses when they testified as the trial court did and therefore cannot tell their direction (see Pandya =Vs= Pandya (1957) E A 336)”






17.
I have considered the memorandum of Appeal the lower court record and the parties submissions. I have identified the following issues for determination:
a.
Whether the Appeal herein was time- barred
b.
Whether the investigation , recommendation for prosecution and the prosecution of the Appellant in the lower court was illegal
c.
Whether prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.








Whether the Appeal was time- barred.


18.
Let me first dispense with the only issue raised by the Respondent, namely the issue of the whether the Appeal was filed late and whether if any leave was sought for any late filing.






19.
The record shows that the issue of whether or not the Appeal was filed out of time was dealt with by my brother Justice J. A Wananda. Through the Ruling delivered on 25
th
 January 2023. He admitted the Appeal and deemed it to have been filed within the time. This issue is therefore moot.








Whether the investigations , recommendation for prosecution and the prosecution of the Appellant was illegal


20.
The testimony of PW15, the investigation officer, attached to EACC , is relevant in this regard. He told the court that on 18/ 9/ 2015  he received instructions to carry out investigations regarding acquisition of wheel barrows by Bungoma county. He proceeded to procure several documents for that purpose . He further stated that he forwarded his findings to ODPP and the accused persons before court were eventually charged. I notice that the witness was not taken to task on the legality of his actions at the time or on whether there was a commissioner(s) in the office to give him Authority to conduct the investigation. Equally in his defence , the Appellant herein did not question the legality of the prosecution process as well as his prosecution. . The issue of the legality of the prosecution therefore is being raised for the first time in this Appeal.






21.
The next question then is whether the Appellant should be allowed to raise this issue on an Appeal yet he acquiesced on it during trial. In Mwangi v. Republic (2006) 2 KLR 94 the Appellate court was determining the legality of a lower trial based on unsworn evidence of prosecution witnesses, which issue had not been raised during trial . The court held interalia:  It does not matter that the issue is being raised for the first time in this appeal. If a trial was a nullity then it does not matter at what stage that issue is raised.”






22.
The main issue in this Appeal is the legality of the investigations and trial of the Appellant. Though the nature of the illegality was different in Mwangi’s case(supra), the issue to be determined is the same;- , namely whether the trial was a nullity due to its illegality. The principle set out in Mwangi’s case is therefore applicable to this case. Am duly guided . This court will therefore proceed to consider this issue notwithstanding the fact that it is being raise for the first time in this Appeal.






23.
The Appellant’s case is that , there were no commissioners in office at the time he was investigated and at the commencement of his prosecution, and therefore, the EACC was not properly constituted. That was the period between May 2015 and 23
rd
 January 2016, according to the Appellant. This submission has not been contested by the Respondent and therefore I will treat it as an admitted fact.






24.
It is further submitted that in the absence of the commissioners there was no one to sanction his investigation and recommendation for prosecution.






25.
To address this issue effectively it is imperative to look at the structure of EACC, its functions as an entity, the role of commissioners, and or against that of the secretariat. What central role do the commissioners play in the commission? In their absence, the commission ceases to function?






26.
The EACC is established pursuant to the provisions of Article 79 of 
the Constitution
. The 
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act
, No. 22 of 2011 was later enacted by the parliament to operationalize Article 79.






27.
Pursuant to Article 253 of 
the constitution
, EACC , like other independent commissions established by 
the constitution
, is a corporate entity with a legal personality of its own, capable of suing and being sued and independent of the commissioners and/or its employees in any event.






28.
The functions of EACC is set out under section 11 of the EACC Act . Under section 11(1) (d) one of the functions , relevant to this case ,is to “ investigate and to recommend to the director of public prosecutions of any acts of corruption , bribery or economic crimes or violations of codes of ethics or other matter prescribed under this Act , the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act or any other law enacted pursuant to chapter six of 
the constitution
.”






29.
The functions of the commissioners are found in section 11(6). The functions are:
“


a).
assist the commission in policy formulation and ensure that the commission and its staff including the secretary perform their duties to the highest standards possible in accordance with this Act






b).
give strategic direction to the commission in the performance of its functions as stipulated in this Act


c).
establish and maintain strategic linkages and partnerships with other stakeholders in the rule of law and other governance sector








d).
deal with reports, complains of abuse of power; impropriety and other forms of misconduct on the part of the commission or its staff and;






e).
deal with reports of conduct amounting to maladministration including, but not limited to delay in the conduct of investigations and unreasonable invasion of privacy by the commission or its staff.”








30.
The responsibilities of the secretary of the commission is set out under section 16 (8) (c ) and it includes to : (i) carry out the decisions of the commission , (ii) day to day Administration and management of the affairs of the commission (iii) supervision of Employees of the commission , (iv) the performance of such other duties as may be assigned by the commission”






31.
The imperative , and indeed a preliminary question that needs to be answered is whether the commission, through its secretary, as head of the secretariat could carry out its legal mandate in the absence of commissioners.






32
In Ephantus M. Kagomo & 6 others vs Industrial and commercial Development corporation (2012) e KLR justice Odunga had this to say about the central role of directors in a Corporate entity: “A corporation is an artificial legal entity. Accordingly it must of necessity act through agents, usually the Board of Directors. 
In other words the corporation’s brain is the Board of Directors who make decisions on behalf of the company.
 A company may in many ways be likened to a human body; it also has hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with the directions from the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be said to represent the mind or will. 
Others are directors and managers who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control what it does. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of the company and is treated by law as such. The day to day management of the company may, however, be handled by specific officers tasked to do so on behalf of the Board. However, the ultimate responsibility rests with the directors. It therefore follows that the management of the corporation must be deemed to be carried by or on behalf of the Board save in cases where the ultra vires principle applies”
 ( Emphasis added).






33.
Am of the view that the above central role of the board directors apply to any legal entity having a legal personality of its own. Depending on the structure of such legal entity the “ the brain of the company” in the words of Justice Odunga( supra) goes by the name : “Board of Directors,” “Board of trustees” “ Commissioners “ as in the case of EACC , or by whatever other name called.






34.
I entirely associate myself with the findings of justice Odunga in the above stated case, that is to say , ultimately it is the Board , or commissioners who are accountable of what happens in an organization, They must answer to the stakeholders and third parties.






35.
Further , with specific reference to EACC, the court of Appeal had this to say in mwaura kamau’s case ( supra), about the mandate of the Board of EACC: “It is the core mandate of EACC under section 11(1) (d) of the EACC Act to: ‘ investigate and recommend to the director of public prosecution of any acts of corruption , bribery of economic crimes or violation of codes goes by the name of ethics or other matter prescribed under this Act, the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act or any other law enacted pursuant to chapter six of 
the constitution
: From that provision it is crystal clear to us that the functions of investigating and making recommendations to the DPP belong corporately to EACC and not to the secretary or secretariat alone. The investigations and the recommendations to the DPP must be 
authorised and sanctioned by the commissioners who are required to exercise oversight over the secretariat and overall, to give strategic direction to EACC in the performance of its function under the Act. T
hat is the position notwithstanding section 3 of the Anti- corruption and Economic crimes Act which empowers the secretary or the person authorized by the secretary to conduct investigations on behalf on behalf of EACC.A proper reading of ACECA together with EACC Act ca not justify the conclusion that that officers to whom specific powers of EACC have been delegated can purport to bypass the EACC Commissioners who are ultimately responsible to the Kenyan people for the proper discharge of EACC’s constitutional and statutory duty” ( Emphasis added)






36.
On whether the secretary/ secretariat could act on its own , in the same Mwaura’s case ( supra), the court went on to state: Whereas we appreciate that the staff may, based on their areas of specialization, perform the duties for which they are appointed, to contend that they have a free hand to make binding recommendations arising from their duties without reference to the Commission, in our view would be absurd. The outcome of the tasks undertaken by the Commission’s staff must be ratified by the Commissioners if they are to be deemed as the decisions of the Commission otherwise unilateral actions taken by the staff may well be deemed to be insubordination”.






37.
Looking at the functions of the EACC Secretariat as set out in section 16(8) (c) (supra), apart from carrying out the decisions of the commission, it is evident that the other functions are purely the Administrative and management functions. In this regard , I find support again in the mwaura case where the court held that the investigations and recommendation of prosecution are key functions of the commission which the secretariat cannot carry out while bypassing the Commissioners .






38.
Am bound by the decision of the court of Appeal as set out in mwaura’s case. In the absence of the commissioners , the secretariat could not investigate and recommend to the DPP the prosecution of the Appellant herein. The entire process was a nullity.






39.
The investigation and the prosecution of the Appellant was therefore a nullity from the start. It can not be allowed to stand. The conviction and sentence is hereby quashed.






40.
The next question is whether a retrial should be ordered.






41.
The test as to whether a retrial should be considered was set out in the case of Opicho v. R [2009] KLR 369, 375 where the court of Appeal stated as follows:“In many other decisions of this Court it has been held that although some factors may be considered, such as illegalities or defects in the original trial; the length of time elapsed since the arrest and arraignment of the appellant; 
whether mistakes leading to the quashing of the conviction were entirely the prosecution’s making or not; whether on a proper consideration of the admissible evidence or potentially admissible evidence, a conviction might result from a retrial; at the end of the day, each case must depend on its own particular facts and circumstances and an order for retrial should only be made where the interests of justice require it.
 ( Emphasis added).






42.
In the present case , the circumstances were that it was not just the trial that was illegal but the entire investigation was tainted with illegalities. It can not be said therefore that the admissible or potentially admissible evidence on record will secure a conviction if a retrial was to be ordered. Ordering for a retrial on the basis of such evidence will mean that the trial will suffer the same outcome. In the circumstances of this case therefore a retrial can not be the next course of action.






43.
I hasten to add that this conclusion does not bar the EACC from taking any further action against the Appellant as long as there is compliance with the EACC Act , 
the Constitution
 and other applicable laws .






44.
In the end this Appeal succeeds. The trial of the Appellant in Kakamega Chief Magistrate’s court EACC NO.1 of 2017 is hereby quashed and sentence set aside.

Ruling










1.
This ruling determines the application dated 11/10/2023 by the appellant. It was brought under section 32 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
, Rule 10 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (Appeals to the High Court) rules 2015, Order 22 rule 22, Order 42 rules 4,6 and 7, section 79G of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 51 rules 1 and 3 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010, section 3 and 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
.






2.
The application seeks orders that the memorandum of appeal be allowed and be deemed to be properly on record. That orders for stay of execution be issued pending the hearing and determination of the application.






3.
The application was supported by the grounds set out on the face thereof and the affidavit sworn by Christine Mwanja on 11/10/2023. It was contended that the time for filing an appeal against the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal had already expired. The delay in lodging the appeal was attributed to government bureaucracies, which resulted in the appeal being filed outside the statutory timelines.






4.
The appellant argued that the appeal was filed without unreasonable delay and was justified, as it raised important legal and factual issues. Additionally, the appellant noted that the respondent would not suffer any prejudice if the extension was granted and that it would be in the interest of justice to allow the appeal to be heard and determined on merit.






5.
The application was opposed vide a replying affidavit sworn by Leila Beatrice Kayoro sworn on 6/11/2023. She deponed that the appellant owed the respondent Kshs 52,673,752/- in VAT Refunds from the year 2005 to 2023 which amount continues to exacerbate.






6.
It was argued that the appellant had not satisfied the conditions for a stay of execution, as it failed to demonstrate substantial loss or provide security. The appellant could not claim it would suffer loss by repaying money that rightfully belongs to the respondent. It was further stated that the funds would help the respondent replenish its cash flow and any delay in receiving the refund would be unfair to it. That it should not be prevented from enjoying the fruits of its judgment.






7.
Parties filed their respective submissions which I carefully considered. The appellant submitted that the Court should exercise its discretion under section 3A and allow the appeal to be filed out of time. That the appellant should not be denied the opportunity to pursue its appeal. Counsel noted that the delay in filing the appeal was 25 days after receiving the certified copies of the proceedings and judgment. That this delay was not excessive as it had been explained.






8.
Regarding the stay of execution, counsel expressed concern that it was uncertain whether the respondent would be able to refund the money if the appeal was to succeed. The respondent had not filed an affidavit of means, leaving its financial status unclear. Additionally, counsel pointed out that there had been no unreasonable delay in bringing the application to court.






9.
For the respondent, it was submitted that judgment was delivered on 14/7/2023, giving the appellant 30 days to appeal, which expired on 14/8/2023. The appellant, however, filed the appeal 30 days beyond the statutory deadline without obtaining leave of Court. It was submitted that the appellant's failure to seek the court's permission before filing the memorandum of appeal violated procedural laws.






10.
The respondent’s Counsel submitted that the delay in filing the appeal was not adequately explained. Regarding the stay of execution, it was submitted that the appellant had not demonstrated any substantial loss it would suffer. That in any event, the appellant had not provided any security for the due performance of the decree.






11.
I have carefully considered the parties' arguments in their pleadings and the submissions on record. The first issue to be determined is whether the memorandum of appeal should be considered properly filed. The appellant stated that the Tribunal delivered its judgment on 14/7/2023, prompting the appeal against that decision. However, the time allowed for filing an appeal had already expired, and the appellant attributed the delay to government bureaucracies in issuing instructions to file the appeal.






12.
The timelines and procedure for filing appeals from the Tribunal are governed by section 32(1) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
. This provision gives the court the discretion to extend the time within which an appellant may file a Notice of Appeal and a Memorandum of Appeal. It provides as follows: -
“
A party to proceedings before the Tribunal may, within thirty days after being notified of the decision or within such further period as the High Court may allow, appeal to the High Court, and the party so appealing shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the other party.”






13.
Other applicable provisions are section 53 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and Rule 3 of the Tax Appeal Tribunal Rules 2015 Rules.






14.
The cumulative effect of the foregoing is that, a party has a right to appeal the decision of the Tribunal within 30 days of being notified of the decision. In Commissioner of Domestic Taxes v. Mayfair Insurance Company Ltd, ML HC ITA No. 31 of 2017 [2017] eKLR, the court held that its powers and discretion to extend time are unlimited but must be exercised judiciously.






15.
From the record, the decision of the Tribunal was made on 14/7/2023. The notice of appeal was served on 9.8.2023. The appeal was subsequently filed on 9/10/2023, resulting in a delay of 30 days. The Supreme Court has established additional guidelines that courts must consider when deciding on an application for an extension of time. See Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat V Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 7 Others, [2014] eKLR.






16.
Some of the considerations are, the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, public interest and the prejudice to be suffered by the other party.






17.
In the present case, the delay was for only 30 days. I have reviewed the appellant's reasons for the delay and I find that the 30-day delay is not excessive. Furthermore, the respondent will not suffer any prejudice if the appeal is allowed to proceed as it is.






18.
Regarding the stay of execution, I am alive to the twin requirements under Order 42 Rule 6. Rule 6(1) of substantial loss and security. The appellant contended that if the monies were released to the respondent the latter may not be able to refund the same were the appeal to succeed. I have considered that notwithstanding such a challenge, the respondent did not give any evidence to show its ability to refund the same.






19.
As to security, I am alive to the fact that the applicant is the official government’s revenue collector. Obviously, it is here to stay and has perpetual succession. It will be able to pay the sum any time it may be required tom do so unlike many government Ministries and Departments.






20.
I am alive that there is a Rapid Response initiative that has been put in place by the Principal Judge of the High Court. That if this appeal were to be filed forthwith, it can be determined before the end of October, 2024.






21.
For the foregoing reasons, I find the application to be meritorious and I allow the same. Due to the time between 2005 and now that the respondent states that it is suffering for being denied the refunds it claims, I make the following orders with strict timelines: -
a.
Time for filing the appeal is hereby extended as prayed and the Memorandum of Appeal on record deemed properly filed.
b.
The appellant to file and serve a Record of Appeal within 7 days of this Ruling.
c.
The respondent to file and serve its Statement of facts within 7 days of service of the Record of Appeal.
d.
The Appellant to file and serve own submissions within 7days of service of the Statement of facts.
e.
The respondent to file and serve own submissions within 7 days of service of the submissions by the appellant.
f.
Time is of the essence and any party who files any document outside the timelines set out hereinabove will result in the document being deemed struct out without the necessity of making an application for that purpose or any order for that purpose.
g.
Matter shall be mentioned before the DR on 26/9/2024 to fix this matter in the RRI Cause List.
h.
The costs of the application shall be in the Cause.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The application before Court is by the 1
st
 defendant and is dated 13/9/2023. It is brought under the provisions of Order 23 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. It seeks for the garnishee order nisi to be made absolute against the 4 Garnishees on various accounts held on behalf of the plaintiffs.






2.
The application was based on the grounds set out on the face thereof and the affidavit of Jacob Mbae Meeme sworn on even date. These were that; the applicant has a decree for Kshs 45,526,583/= with interest at 18% per annum which remains unsatisfied. That the plaintiffs were directed to settle the same in installments but only Kshs 2 million had been paid as at 31/8/2023.






3.
That the applicant has information that the plaintiffs maintain accounts with the Garnishees. That the decretal sum is likely to be satisfied if the accounts were attached. That there were no other assets to be attached and the plaintiffs have means of settling the decree through moneys held in the said accounts.






4.
The application was opposed by the 2
nd
 plaintiff vide his replying affidavit sworn on 19/9/2023 on behalf of the plaintiffs. They contended that judgment was entered on 20/6/2023 for Kshs. 45,526,583/-. That the decree was extracted and issued on 13/7/2023. That as at that time, the plaintiffs had paid Kshs.24,800,00/=.






5.
That the accrued amount was from a hire purchase agreement between the 1
st
 plaintiff and the 1
st
 defendant and is the subject matter of a separate suit to wit HCCC E294/2023 between the plaintiff, the defendant and Capital Square Ltd That in the said suit, the plaintiff is seeking to set off the decretal sum against the amounts owed to it as per prior agreements between parties.






6.
That the plaintiffs were willing to surrender the motor vehicles the subject of the hire purchase agreements for valuation and release to the defendant’s custody. That this is without prejudice to the plaintiff’s legal rights in this case and in HCCC E294/2023 aforesaid.






7.
The garnishees filed various replying affidavits to the application as follows: -
a.
The 1
st
 garnishee filed an affidavit by George Kinyua sworn on 19/9/2023. It admitted holding Acc. No. 01014060007 with Kshs.2,134,318/38.as at 14/9/2023. That however, the said sum were subject to an Agency Notice by the Kenya Revenue
b.
The 2
nd
 garnishee filed an affidavit by Michael Massawa sworn on 2/10/2023. He denied the existence of any account as Ac No. 2045687623. That the other account numbers 2043113737 and 2043456130 were incorrect and did not exist.
c.
The 3
rd
 garnishee filed a replying and supplementary affidavit by Jackson Nyaga and Christine Wahome dated 21/9/2023 and 8/11/2023. It admitted holding 2 accounts holding a total of Kshs.28,035.12. That any debits made in the accounts were before the order nisi was served.
d.
The 4
th
 garnishee filed a replying affidavit by Mathew Kipngetich sworn on 6/10/2023. It admitted holding the subject account with Kshs.98.78 only.






8.
The parties filed their respective submissions which I have considered together with the authorities relied on. From the outset, it must be noted that garnishee proceedings are usually secondary and not primary execution proceeding. The primary execution proceeding is as between the decree-holder against the judgment/debtor.






9.
In Choice Investments Ltd vs. Jeromnimon (Midland Bank Ltd, Garnishee) [1981] 1 All ER 225 at page 227, the court stated that: -
“
There are two steps in the process. The first is a garnishee order nisi. Nisi is Norman-French. It means ‘unless’. It is an order on the bank to pay the £100 to the judgment creditor or into court within a stated time unless there is some sufficient reason why the bank should not do so. Such reason may exist if the bank disputes its indebtedness to the customer for one reason or other. Or if payment to this creditor might be unfair by preferring him to other creditors: see Pritchard v Westminster Bank Ltd [1969] 1 All ER 999, [1969] 1 WLR 547 and Rainbow v Moorgate Properties Ltd [1975] 2 All ER 821, [1975] 1 WLR 788. If no sufficient reason appears, the garnishee order is made absolute, to pay to the judgment creditor, or into court, whichever is the more appropriate.”






10.
In CG Waithima & Company Advocate vs Africa Merchant Assurance Company Limited; UBA Bank Kenya Limited & 2 others [2023] KEHC 2344 (KLR), the court held that: -
“
… in law, the onus placed on a Garnishee would only be discharged where it successfully establishes that the account or accounts covered by the Garnishee Order nisi do not exist in its system or if it exists, it is in debt and not in credit or that it has a right of set o? or lien which are due effective against the customer.”






11.
Finally, in Brookside Dairy Limited v Adoncan Njagi & 2 others; Cooperative Bank of Kenya & another (Garnishee) [2021] eKLR, the court held that: -
“
This Court is mindful that it cannot confirm a garnishee order where the account from which a debt is sought to be attached is non-existence. Court orders cannot be made in vain.”






12.
In the present case, the defendant’s principal claim is as against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs made a spirited defence claiming that the amount due was not Kshs.45m odd but that they had paid in excess of Kshs.26m. A statement of payment was produced to that effect. The plaintiffs also deposed that they were willing to surrender for valuation and subsequent sale of all the securities created to secure the decretal sum.






13.
Although the said offer was made on without prejudice to other claims being asserted by the plaintiffs, the decree-holder did not respond to the said assertions. This is so notwithstanding that the decree-holder filed a supplementary affidavit in which it could have responded to those claims.






14.
The question therefore that begs is, what is the amount due that any of the garnishees can be called upon to answer? Is it Kshs. 45m plus 18% or that amount less Kshs.26m? Further, in view of the paltry sum due in the acknowledged accounts, should the garnishees be pursued when the securities are being offered by the judgment-debtor to realize the decretal sum? I think in the circumstances of this case, it is better to pursue the judgment-debtor before pursuing the garnishees. In any event, the amounts due in the admitted accounts are paltry.






15.
In view of the foregoing, I find the application to be unmeritorious and the same is dismissed. I will not make any order as to costs.




It is so ordered.

Between




Zacharia Moenga Maingi


 


Plaintiff




and




Housing Finance Corporation (K) Company Ltd


 


Defendant










Ruling










1.
This is a ruling on the defendant’s application dated 3/5/2023. It was brought under Order 5 Rules 1(3), 5 and 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules and sections 1A, 1B and 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
. It sought the striking out of the plaint dated 30/8/2021 for failure to take out summons within the stipulated time.






2.
It was supported by the affidavit of Hedaya Malesi SWORN ON 3/5/2023. The grounds were that the suit was commenced vide the plaint dated 30/8/2021 which was accompanied with a Motion on Notice of even date. The Motion sought injunctive orders against the defendant restraining it from dealing with Molo/Sachangwani Block1/79 (“suit property”).






3.
That the two documents were served on 2/9/2021. That the defendant’s advocates on record filed a Notice of Appointment and replying affidavit to the Motion. That to-date, no Summons to enter appearance have ever been served upon the defendant as provided under Order 5 Rules 1 and 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules. That in the premises, the suit has abated by operation of law.






4.
The application was opposed vide a replying affidavit of Joy Othieno Ochieng sworn on 29/6/2023. It was contended that as at the date of swearing the affidavit, 3 years had not lapsed since the date of filing suit and the suit had therefore not abated. That failure to take out summons to enter appearance was an inadvertence of counsel and was caused by the urgency in the plaintiff’s application dated 30/8/2021 seeking to injunct re-advertisement and auction of the suit property.






5.
Counsel stated that immediately after the injunction application was heard, she would have taken out the Summons but she fell sick and her staff failed to bring the file to her attention. That the suit is based on a Charge made over 30years ago. That the failure to take out the summons was a technicality. She urged that the application be dismissed as no prejudice was caused by failing to include summons in the pleadings.






6.
The parties filed submissions which I have considered. I have also considered the many authorities cited by Learned Counsels. The defendant cited no less than 8 authorities in its contention that the failure to serve the summons was not a mere procedural step but a mandatory step which goes to the root of the suit.






7.
This is an application to strike out the suit on the grounds that summons were not taken out and that the suit has abated by dint of Order 5 Rule 1(6) of the Civil Procedure Rules.






8.
There are two schools of thought that exist on this matter. The first school of thought is that, by the use of the term ‘shall’ it is mandatory and the failure to comply therewith leads to the striking out of the suit. That the suit shall abate on failure to take out and serve the summons within 30days. Some of these cases include Grace Wairimu Mungai vs. Catherine Njambi Muya [2014] Eklr, Karandeep Singh Dhilon & Anor vs. Nteppes Enterprises Ltd & Anor [2010] eKLR and Tana Trading Ltd vs. National Cereals and Produce Board [2014] eKlr.






9.
The second school of thought is that, notwithstanding the use of the word ‘shall’, the suit does not nevertheless abate, the failure is curable and that each case has to be considered on its own peculiar circumstances. Some of the case under this school include Paulina Wanza Maingi vs. Diamond Trust Bank Ltd & Anor [2015] Eklr, Tropical Foods International & Anor Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank & Ano [2017] Eklr, Nairobi Aviation Ltd vs. Nation Media Group Ltd [2020] eKLR, Fredrick Kibet Chesire vs. Raymond W. Bomet [2006] Eklr.






10.
In Paulina Wanza Maingi case (supra), Aburili J held: -
“
In my humble view, since the purpose of summons to enter appearance is to notify the defendant and or invite them to defend the suit, … and six years having elapsed since this suit was instituted, it would be a traversity of justice to dismiss the suit for want of summons when the 1
st
 defendant has actively been participating in the suit.”






11.
In Amina Hersi Moghe & 2 Others vs. Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd & Anor [2021], Tuiyot J ( as he then was) held that: -
“
This Court identifies itself with the latter views. It takes the position that where, even without the issuance and service of summons, a Defendant enters appearance or files defence or otherwise actively participates in defending its position in proceedings without protesting that it has not been served then it will be taken to have waived its right to challenge the validity of the suit on account of failure to comply with Order 5 rule. Unless, and this is the condition, it can demonstrate that non-adherence to those provisions has prejudiced or caused it hardship which cannot be compensated in costs.”






12.
After careful consideration and soul searching, I will depart from the position I held in 2014 at the time of Tana Trading Ltd vs. National Cereals and Produce Board (supra). It is clear that the issuance and service of summons is meant to notify a defendant of the plaintiff’s claim and require the defendant to defend its position. If a defendant comes to know of the suit and appears and actively participates thereon, what prejudice does it suffer for not having been served with summons? I see none. No doubt the issuance and service of summons cannot be said to be insignificance in the prosecution of a suit, but in the interests of justice, its purpose should be considered in the overall administration of justice.






13.
In the present case, the suit was lodged on 30/8/2021. The plaint and Motion were served on 2/9/2021. Were the defendant not having participated subsequent thereto by appearing and filing its responses to the Motion, the suit would have abated on 2/10/2021. However, there was active participation by all the parties culminating in the ruling of 14/10/2022 which allowed the injunction application.






14.
What is at stake is land. The parties entered into a loan agreement whereby certain facilities amounting to Kshs.300,000/- were advanced to the plaintiff in 1993. The plaintiff alleges that he has since paid the same in full yet the defendant was demanding a sum of Kshs.1,372,806/- as at June, 2021. What prejudice has the defendant suffered with the failure to serve the summons? I see none. On the other hand, if the application is allowed, the plaintiff will not only suffer the monies he has already paid to the defendant but he will also lose the suit property.






15.
Further, the active participation of the defendant in the interlocutory proceedings coupled with the explanation of the sickness of the advocate for the plaintiff appeals to this Court to exercise its discretion in favor of sustaining the suit. In any event, the summons has since been issued and served, albeit after the filing of the present application. There is already a defence on record, though filed under protest.






16.
In view of the foregoing, I am inclined to support the second school of thought, that where a defendant actively participates in proceedings where summons have not been served, it would be unjust and unfair to allow such a defendant to turn around and seek the dismissal of such suit. The defendant should be taken to have been aware of the suit and be having participated as such, waives his right to seek the remedies under Order 5 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules.






17.
Accordingly, I find that the application lacks merit and is dismissed. I will however, allow the costs in favor of the applicant of Kshs.15,000/-. Let the parties undertake pre-trials expeditiously before the Deputy Registrar.




It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
These proceedings relate to the Estate of Ali Kong’ani Kweyu (Deceased). The contestants herein are widows of the Estate and are all Administrators of his Estate.






2.
Through the summons dated 23/12/2019, Saina Muranda Kong’ani (Petitioner) filed summons for Confirmation of Grant. the Petitioner listed the propertiIn the Affidavit in support of the summons she listed the following Estate Assets as:
i.
South Teso/Amukwa/3030
ii.
Bukhayo/Kisoko/3041
iii.
N/Wanya/Matungu/2496
iv.
N/Wanya/Matungu/2407
v.
Money in Cooperative Bank
vi.
Motor vehicle Registration No. KND104 - Pick-up






3.
She further listed 28 children as belonging to the deceased. She further proposed that the assets be shared equally between the deceased’s children.






4.
The Summons attracted a protest by Fatuma Maloba Kong’ani (The Protester) . In her Affidavit of protest, the she states that she was not aware of the filing of the Summons for Confirmation of Grant. She further stated that she had 6 children with the deceased and was also taking care of the deceased’s five other children born out of a previous marriage; that in the year 2000, the deceased settled his wives in various parcels. She proposes that each family therefore should settle in the land that the deceased had allocated to them.






5.
I have perused the various affidavits and the oral testimonies of the witnesses. I have noted that the Petitioner admits that she and her children reside in 2 parcels of land. The parcels are Titie No. Bukhayo/Kisoko/3041 and another unnamed one. The protester has also informed the court that the 4th wife, one Consolata Shibwabo Kong’ani resides in Ejinja in an unidentified land parcel measuring about 9 acres. The parcel number of this land is however not disclosed.






6.
It is not also clear as to how many children the deceased had. whereas the Petitioner listed 28 children while in her oral testimony, she told the court that she did not know how the number of the deceased’s children. Her witness (DW2) stated that the deceased had 25 children. Further, whereas the Petitioner and DW2 told the court that the 4th wife had no children, the Protester told the court she had 4 children.






7.
Consequently, I decline to consider the confirmation of grant at this point, until the full disclosures are made in respect to the children of the deceased and all their particulars as well as an inventory of the assets as aforesaid.






8.
I hereby make the following directions:
a).
The Petitioner to make a full disclosure of the land parcel she currently occupies apart from Bukhayo/Kisoko/3041. Such disclosure to include particulars of proprietorship.
b).
Consolata Shibwabo Kong’ani to provide the particulars of the land parcel she occupies in Ejinja. The disclosure to be accompanied by a certificate of official search in respect of the said property.
c).
The Petitioner and Protester to make full disclosure of the children of the deceased categorised into houses. If any of the dependants is deceased, it should be stated whether such a child/child left behind any children.
d).
The parties to the file further Affidavit for purposes of the above discloses.
e).
Compliance is within 30 days from the date of this Ruling.
f).
This matter will be mentioned on a date to be stated at the time of the delivery of this Ruling to confirm compliance with above directions.

          (Being an Appeal from the ruling of the Business Premises and Rent Tribunal delivered by the Hon. Patricia May on 13th February 2023 in Nairobi BPRT Case No. E628 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This judgment is in respect to an appeal filed against the ruling and orders of the Business Premises and Rent Tribunal delivered by Hon. Patricia May on 13
th
 February 2023 in NAIROBI BPRT CASE NO E628 of 2022.






2.
The Tribunal in its Ruling allowed the 1
st
 Respondent’s application dated 14
th
 July 2022 and allowed the said application and granted the following orders:
i.
That  pending the hearing and determination of this application, a temporary injunction is hereby issued restraining the Respondent/Landlord either by himself, agents, servants and/or personal representatives from interfering and/or disrupting the peaceful running of the health club and swimming pool.
ii.
A declaration is hereby issued that the action of the Respondents are unlawful, illegal and against requisite law.
iii.
That  an order is hereby issued that the said tools of work denied access by the Respondent/Landlord be allowed including the generator.
iv.
That  the OCS Kileleshwa Police Station to enforce the compliance of the orders.






3.
The Appellant being aggrieved by the said ruling and orders filed the instant appeal vide a Memorandum of Appeal dated 3
rd
 March 2023. The following grounds were raised in the appeal:
i.
That  the Tribunal erred both in law and fact in finding that there existed a Landlord and Tenant relationship as between the Appellant and the 1
st
 Respondent.
ii.
That  the Tribunal erred both in law and fact in failing to order the striking out of the Appellant’s name from the proceedings and further proceeding to issue adverse orders against the Appellant.
iii.
That  the Tribunal erred in failing to wholesomely take into account the Appellant's contentions and arguments and in so doing failing to render a complete determination of the issues raised for determination.
iv.
That  the Tribunal erred in allowing prayers No. 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the 1
st
 Respondent’s Application dated 14
th
 July 2022.






4.
The Appellant thus sought the following orders:
i.
The Appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal be and is hereby allowed.
ii.
That  the 1
st
 Respondent’s application dated 14
th
 July 2022 be dismissed with costs by the Appellant.
iii.
That  costs of the Appeal be awarded to the Appellant.






5.
The appeal was canvassed through written submissions. The Appellant filed written submissions dated 5
th
 January 2024 while the 1
st
 Respondent filed written submissions dated 22
nd
 February 2024. No written submissions were filed by the 2
nd
 Respondent.






6.
The Appellant submitted that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine any alleged dispute as against the Appellant and Respondents since the Appellant did not have a landlord and Tenant relationship with either of them but is merely a Management Company. It was argued that the Appellant is a Management company duly incorporated and charged with the management of all those apartments and common areas erected on all that land known as LR No 1870/VI/85 situate in Westlands, Nairobi and known as Connaught Apartments and did not have any lease and/or rental agreement with the 1
st
 Respondent at all and neither did the Appellant lease any property to the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant the 1
st
 Respondent filing a reference against it supposedly as a Landlord .






7.
It was also submitted that without the approval of the Appellant the Management company, the 2
nd
 Respondent alleging to be the lawful owner had left out the premises swimming pool and health club facilities to the 1
st
 Respondent to use the same for carrying on commercial activities which were open to the general public and which caused substantial nuisance to the premises’ other home owners. It was further argued that the use of the swimming pool area and health club facilities for commercial purposes was for all intents and purposes unlawful and as such the Appellant could not allow the same.






8.
The Appellant submitted that it had filed a suit in the Environment and Land Court at Mililani being Mililani ELC E265 of 2022 –Maple Management vs. Juliana Jambi Kihara seeking a determination on the basis upon which the 2
nd
 Respondent alleges to own the premises and further upon which she had leased out the same to the 1
st
 Respondent as well as the basis upon which the 1
st
 Respondent was carrying out a commercial activity thereon when the same is strictly prohibited yet there had not been a change of user on the property.






9.
It was also submitted that despite the Tribunal lacking jurisdiction, it declined to allow the Appellant’s name from being struck out of the Tribunal proceedings, declined to stay the Tribunal proceedings pending determination of the ELC matter and summarily went on to hold that the Appellant was a landlord and made orders against it.






10.
The Appellant concluded its submissions by urging this Court to find its appeal merited and allow the same in its entirety.






11.
The 1
st
 Respondent filed its written submissions dated 22
nd
 February 2024. Counsel submitted on the following issues:
i.
Whether the Appellant participated in the lower Court proceedings to conclusion;
ii.
Whether this appeal is res judicata and;
iii.
Whether the lower Court ruling was merited;






12.
It was argued that the Appellant did not move the trial court for its removal from the proceedings and therefore the appeal is an afterthought and should be dismissed with costs.






13.
It was submitted that the appeal is also res judicata since the appellant filed an application in ELC E265 of 2022, Maple Management Company vs. Juliana Kiara & Segbo Tundura Gagi which was dismissed by Lady Justice Omollo.






14.
It was further submitted that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the matter and the appeal herein is not merited. Reliance was placed on the cases of Nancy Mwangi T/A Worthin Marketers v Airtel Networks (K) Ltd & 2 Others [2014] eKLR and Al- Riaz International Limited vs. Ganjoni Properties Limited [2015] eKLR and Section 2 of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
 Cap 301 Laws of Kenya.






15.
The Court was urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.






16.
The Court has considered the entire record of appeal together with the written submissions filed by the parties herein. The Court is of the view that the singular and silent issue for determination herein is whether the appeal is merited and if so what the appropriate reliefs that ought to be granted.






17.
In determining the issues raised in the Appeal this court is cognizant of its duty on a first appeal as set out in the case of Selle & Another –Vs- Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd & others (1968) EA 123 cited with approval in China Z Hogxing Construction Company Ltd –Vs- Ann Akeru Sophia (2020) eKLR.






18.
As has also been restated in the case of United India Insurance Co. Ltd V East African Underwriters (Kenya) Ltd (1985) E.A a court sitting on Appeal will not interfere with a discretionary decision appealed from simply on the ground that the court, if sitting at first instance, would or might have given different weight to that given by the court to the various factors in the case. This court sitting on Appeal is only entitled to interfere if one or more of the following matters are established; first, that the court misdirected himself in law; secondly, that the court misapprehended the facts; thirdly, that the court took account of considerations of which he should not have taken account; fourthly, that the court failed to take account of considerations of which he should have taken account, or fifthly, that the court’s decision, albeit a discretionary one, is plainly wrong.






19.
All the grounds of the Memorandum of Appeal as raised by the Appellant were to the effect that the Tribunal erred in finding that it had jurisdiction over the matter as there existed a Landlord and Tenant relationship as between the Appellant and the 1
st
 Respondent.






20.
The centrality of jurisdiction in any proceedings need not be re-stated. Nyarangi J.A succinctly captured this in Owners of Motor Vessel ‘Lillian S’ vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited [1989] KLR 1 thus:
“
Jurisdiction is everything. Without it, a court has no power to make one more step. Where a court has no jurisdiction, there would be no basis for a continuation of proceedings…”






21.
Similarly, the Court of Appeal in the case of Kakuta Maimai Hamisi vs Peris Pesi Tobiko & 2 Others [2013] eKLR stated as follows:
“
So central and determinative is the jurisdiction that it is at once fundamental and over-arching as far as any judicial proceedings is concerned. It is a threshold question and best taken at inception. It is definitive and determinative and prompt pronouncement on it once it appears to be in issue in a consideration imposed on courts out of decent respect for economy and efficiency and necessary eschewing of a polite but ultimate futile undertaking of proceedings that will end in barren cui-de-sac. Courts, like nature, must not sit in vain.”






22.
Speaking to the source of the Court’s jurisdiction, the Apex Court of Kenya in the case of Samuel Kamau Macharia & another v Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 2 Others [2012]eKLR stated as follows:
“
A court’s jurisdiction flows from either 
the Constitution
 or legislation or both. Thus, a court of law can only exercise jurisdiction as conferred by 
the Constitution
 or other written law. It cannot arrogate to itself jurisdiction exceeding that which is conferred upon it by law.”






23.
The Business Premises Rent Tribunal was enacted as a quasi-judicial organ. Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotel and Catering Establishments) Act Cap 301 establishes the BPRT. Further. The Act mandates the BPRT to hear and determine disputes arising out of a controlled tenancy or simply put a tenancy relationship between a landlord and a tenant of a business premises. Section 12 of the Act enunciates the powers of the BPRT in handling complaints arising from a controlled tenancy relationship. Section 2(1) (a) Cap 301 defines a controlled tenancy as follows:
a.
Which has not been reduced into writing; or
b.
Which has been reduced to writing and which- is for a period not exceeding five years; or
c.
contains provision for termination, otherwise than for breach of covenant, within five years from the commencement thereof; or
d.
Relates to premises of a class specified under subsection (2) of this section.






24.
The Appellant contended that it is a management company duly incorporated and charged with the management of the apartment and common areas on LR No, 1870/VI/85 known as Connaught Apartments and did not have any lease and or rental agreement with the 1
st
 Respondent. It was also contended that the ELC Court in ELC E265 of 2022 delivered a ruling on 27
th
 April 2023 and found that the Plaintiff (Maple Management Limited) has tenancy relationship with the 2
nd
 Defendant (Sgebo Tundura Gagi) as the tenancy agreement exhibited between the defendants.






25.
The 1
st
 Respondent submitting on the issue of jurisdiction argued that the lease agreement was for 5 years commencing on 6
th
 September 2021 and as such the Tribunal was clothed with jurisdiction. It was also submitted that the issues raised by the Appellant were an afterthought since they were not raised by the Appellant before the Tribunal.






26.
From the record of Appeal and the evidence that was presented before the Tribunal, the lease agreement dated 6
th
 September 2021 was executed between the 1
st
 Respondent and the 2
nd
 Respondent. The Appellant was not a party and as such while the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute as between the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents, the same could not have extended to the Appellant who was not a party to the said agreement. The Appellant has no tenancy relationship with the Respondents.






27.
In view of the foregoing, it is the finding of this Court that the Tribunal erred both in law and in fact in finding that there existed a Landlord and Tenant relationship as between the Appellant and the 1
st
 Respondent.






28.
Having found that the Tribunal erred in finding that there existed a Landlord and Tenant relationship between the Appellant and the 1
st
 Respondent this Court must now proceed to grant the appropriate reliefs. The Appellant sought for several reliefs in its appeal including inter alia that the Appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal delivered on 13
th
 February 2023 in NAIROBI BPRT Case No. E628 of 2022 be allowed and the 1
st
 Respondent’s application dated 14
th
 July 2022 filed before the Honorable Tribunal be dismissed together with costs of the Appeal.






29.
The Court has considered the fact that while there existed no tenancy relationship between the Appellant and the 1
st
 Respondent, the 1
st
 Respondent’s application before the Tribunal had sought for some reliefs against both the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent and further there is a dispute that is still pending before the Tribunal in respect to the Tenancy agreement and as such the Tribunal is still obligated to determine the pending dispute.






30.
While considering the entire scope of Section 78 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, an appellant court has the powers to inter alia determine a case in finality and can also perform the same powers and duties as are conferred and imposed on the court of original jurisdiction when the suit was filed.






31.
In view of the foregoing, the following reliefs are hereby issued in respect to this appeal:




i.
The Appellant herein (Maple Management Limited) is hereby struck out from the proceedings in NAIROBI BPRT Case No. E628 of 2022.
ii.
Each party to bear own costs of the Appeal.
Judgment accordingly.

Petitioners’ Case


2.
On or about March, 2018, the 1
st
 Respondent’s officer, one John Ekada contacted the 1
st
 Petitioner’s wife concerning the payment of taxes for the 2
nd
 to 24
th
 Petitioners’. The officer also contacted one, George Okoth Okello one of the Directors of the Companies who was also a Clerk to the late George Oriaro Advocate.






3.
The 1
st
 Petitioner states George Oriaro law firm had all along been filing tax returns for the Companies (Petitioners herein) up to the time Counsel George Oriaro Advocate passed on in August 2015. He stated that the Clerk, George Okoth Okello assured him the demise of George Oriaro would not interfere with the instructions as the Law Firm will continue filing his companies tax returns.






4.
He depones that when he received the 1
st
 Respondent’s communication in this matter, he visited the 1
st
 Respondent offices where he was arrested and released on the same day on a free bond conditioned on availing himself for a meeting that was scheduled to take place the following week.






5.
Upon returning back to the 1
st
 Respondent’s offices, he was informed that he was to be charged with offences contrary to Section 97 (e) as read with Section 104(3) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. He depones that his request to consult the Firm of Advocate that had been filing his returns was declined. The Respondents’ proceeded to institute criminal proceedings against him in Criminal Case No. 471 and 1519 of 2018 at Milimani Law Courts.






6.
Further the 1
st
 Respondent on 1
st
 June 2018 issued notices of assessments of tax against the Petitioners. He claims that the tax liability was estimated from their bank statements which information he contends was acquired unconstitutionally. Additionally, he states that the 1
st
 Respondent on 11
th
 October 2018 requested for information for payment schedules regarding the 2
nd
 to 24
th
 Petitioners’, from the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Regional Development, the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Arts and the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. On top of this, he depones that the 1
st
 Respondent issued a further notice of assessment upon him personally claiming that he had defaulted to pay taxes.






7.
He avers that following this, the 1
st
 Respondent suspended his regional KRA PIN which he claims costed him millions of Kenya Shillings for completed works. He moreover claims that he was wrongfully detained and subjected to inhuman treatment. Furthermore, he complained that the criminal charges have injured his reputation and led to loss of business. In like manner, some of the 1
st
 Petitioner’s properties were auctioned as a result of the Respondents’ actions while others have caveats and agency notices thus making it hard for him to earn a living.






8.
The 1
st
 Petitioner is aggrieved that the 1
st
 Respondent accused him of committing tax offences on the basis that his companies had been evading payment of taxes. According to him, his arrest and charge as a result of these claims was done contrary to the law. Considering this, he posits that the Respondents actions are in direct violation of the Petitioners’ rights under Articles 25(a), 28, 29, 31(c), 47(1) & (2) and 49(1) (d) of 
the Constitution
.








1
st
 Respondent’s Case


9.
The 1
st
 Respondent in response filed its, replying affidavit by its Investigations and Enforcement Officer, John Ekadah sworn on 28
th
 June 2019.






10.
He depones that the 1
st
 Respondent received information that the 1
st
 Petitioner and his companies, the 2
nd
 to 24
th
 Petitioners, were suspected on being involved in fraud and money laundering by siphoning money from various government ministries and departments. As such, this instigated an investigation into the matter. The investigation examined the Petitioners tax compliance for the period between 2010 and 2017.






11.
He depones that the preliminary findings indicated that the Petitioners had not filed both corporation tax and VAT, despite earning taxable income. It was discovered that the Petitioners had cumulatively been paid Ksh.582,322,534 and not filed returns in that respect to income tax, VAT, PAYE and Capital gains tax. This in essence ascertained that the Petitioners had committed an offense contrary to Section 97 (e) as read with Section 104(3) of the Tax Procedure Act.






12.
Following the findings, the 1
st
 Respondent on 23
rd
 and 29
th
 January 2018 tried to contact the 1
st
 Petitioner on his mobile phone however was not able reach him. The 1
st
 Respondent thereafter issued a letter dated 28
th
 February 2018 requiring the 1
st
 Petitioner to appear before the Commissioner.






13.
The 1
st
 Respondent further contacted the 1
st
 Petitioner’s wife, Violet Akinyi, who is listed as the 18
th
 and 19
th
 Petitioners’ Director and requested she also avails herself for a meeting. It is noted that despite the scheduled meeting with the two, neither of them presented themselves. Further follow ups on the meeting also proved futile as they remained uncooperative.






14.
He states that the 1
st
 Respondent correspondingly reached out to other persons listed as Directors for these companies including George Okoth Okello, who was listed as a Director for the 6
th
, 15
th
 ,19
th
 and 20
th
 Petitioners.






15.
Mr. George appeared before the Commissioner on 6
th
 March 2018. He however denied knowing of the existence of the other Companies. The other listed Directors, Steven Otieno Ouma listed for the 18
th
 Petitioners and Xylyn Omonge listed for the 5
th
 and 16
th
 Petitioners also denied knowledge of the other companies.






16.
He asserts that owing to these circumstances, the 1
st
 Respondent was compelled to issue a notice of tax assessment on 16
th
 March 2018 pursuant to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015. In response the 1
st
 Petitioner vide am email communication dated 25
th
 March 2018 requested the 1
st
 Respondent to grant him 90 days to finalize its workings and make an appropriate response.






17.
He states that despite this promise the 1
st
 Petitioner did not avail any documents nor clarify the issues raised. This then caused the 1
st
 Respondent to issue notices of assessment on 7
th
 June 2018 pursuant to Section 51(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. This time the 1
st
 Petitioner did not object to the notice.






18.
He depones that the 1
st
 Respondent is empowered under Sections 58, 59(1) & (2) of the Tax Procedure Act to require production of documents by any person to assist the Commissioner determine the tax liability of a person. In line with this, the 1
st
 Respondent requested the 1
st
 Petitioner’s clients as well as his banks to supply information relating to the Petitioners business operations. It is said that the 1
st
 Petitioner had an opportunity to appeal the said assessments according to Section 52 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 but failed to do so. It is said that the assessments were deemed to be admitted at the Tax Appeal Tribunal. Nonetheless no appeal was preferred by the 1
st
 Petitioner in this regard.






19.
In the end, in keeping with Section 7 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, the 1
st
 Petitioner was arrested by the 3
rd
 Respondent and criminal proceedings instigated by the 2
nd
 Respondent. It is noted that during the arrest, the 1
st
 Petitioner was informed of the reason of his arrest which was defaulting tax obligations contrary to Section 97(e) as read with Section 104(3) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






20.
He further denies the 1
st
 Petitioner’s claim that the firm of George Oriaro Advocates were the Petitioners’ tax agents. This is because the Law firm was not licensed by the Commissioner as required under Section 20 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. As such the Firm was not liable for the tax obligations of the Petitioners and neither would this discharge the Petitioners from their tax obligations.






21.
In light of these averments he asserts that the 1
st
 Respondent acted lawfully. Equally that despite granting the 1
st
 Petitioner an opportunity to be heard, he failed to make his case. He stresses that this Petition has been filed in bad faith and an attempt by the 1
st
 Petitioner to frustrate the 1
st
 Respondent’s mandate as empowered by the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
.






22.
Furthermore, he asserts that the 1
st
 Respondent’s decision to deactivate the 1
st
 Petitioner’s PIN and place caveats on his property was an administrative decision and any party dissatisfied with the same is required to appeal to the Tax Appeal Tribunal as provided under Section 52 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. This procedure was not exhausted. The Petition is thus deemed to lack merit and thus urges the Court to dismiss it.








2
nd
 Respondents’ Case


23.
The 2
nd
 Respondent’s pleadings and submissions are not in the Court file or Court online portal (CTS).








3
rd
, 4
th
 and 5
th
 Respondents’ Case


24.
These Respondents’ vide grounds of opposition dated 16
th
 August 2019 opposed the Petition on the basis that:
i.
The Petitioners have not demonstrated how these Respondents violated their constitutional rights.
ii.
The office of the 5
th
 Respondent does not have prosecutorial powers under Article 156 of 
the Constitution
.
iii.
The 5
th
 Respondent is an independent office whose constitutional mandate is to represent the government on legal issues and is not subject to control by any individual or organization.
iv.
The powers to prosecute are vested upon the 2
nd
 Respondent under Article 157 of 
the Constitution
. The office is independent and does not require the consent of any person to commence criminal proceedings in exercise of his or her powers.
v.
The police have the mandate to investigate a complaint under the 
National Police Service Act
 under Section 35 and therefore the 3
rd
 Respondent acted in accordance with the law.
vi.
These Respondents powers and functions are affirmed by the Courts as seen in Attorney General v Attorney General for and on Behalf of Inspector General of Police & 3 Others ex parte Thoman Ng’ang’a Munene(2014)eKLR and Kefah Momanyi Tendere v Director of Public Prosecution & 6 others (2017)eKLR.
vii.
The commencement of Criminal Case No.471 and 1519 of 2018 was carried out within the law. Besides the Petitioner has not demonstrated how this criminal trial is an abuse of the Court process. (See: Benard Mwikya Mulinge v Director of Public Prosecutions & 3 others (2019) eKLR).
viii.
The Petition does not disclose any unconstitutionality of any impugned Sections of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015.
ix.
All Acts of Parliament are presumed to be constitutional unless otherwise as captured in Council of Governors vs Inspector of General pf National Police Service & 3 others (2015) eKLR.
x.
The Petitioners in challenging the constitutionality of the Tax Procedure Act, 2015 failed to appreciate its overall objective as guided in Timothy Njoya v Attorney General & another (2014) eKLR.
xi.
Judicial intervention should be limited to acts that are manifestly in breach of the law or where the Court is satisfied that the decision maker was manifestly unfair and was influenced by other considerations other than the law.
xii.
The right to privacy claimed to have been violated by the Respondents can be limited by the operation of the law if only it can be justified that the limitation is reasonable in an open and democratic society.
xiii.
The Petition is frivolous, vexatious, incompetent and improperly before Court and an abuse of the court process.








Petitioners’ Submissions


25.
The Petitioners through H. Obach & Partners Advocates filed submissions dated 30
th
 July 2019.Counsel sought to discuss: whether the Petitioners constitutional rights were violated; whether Sections 44(1) & (2), 56(1), 58, 59, 60 and 99 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 are unconstitutional and whether the Petitioners are entitled to the reliefs sought.






26.
On the first issue, Counsel reiterated the averments in the 1
st
 Petitioner’s affidavit and submitted that indeed the Petitioners rights had been violated. Counsel submitted that the 1
st
 Respondent in carrying out its function relied on the impugned Sections which are in direct violation to Articles 25(a), 28, 29, 31 (c), 47(1) & (2) and 49(1)(d) of 
the Constitution
. Counsel stressed that Article 10 of 
the Constitution
 binds all state organs and officers including the 1
st
 Respondent in enforcement of tax laws.






27.
In support of this argument, reliance was placed in Samura Engineering Ltd & 10 others vs Kneya Revenue Authority [2012] eKLR , Keroche Breweries LTD & 6 others vs. Attorney General & 10 others (2016) eKLR, Mistry v Interim National Medical and Dental Council & others CCT 13/1997 [1998] ZACC 10, Dry Associates LTD v Capital Markets Authority & another (Nairobi Petiti
on No.328 of 2011
).






28.
Counsel further argued that it is trite law that police officers examine the whole matter before effecting an arrest. He argued that in this case the 1
st
 Petitioner was charged before being heard. In support reliance was placed in Reg. vs Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex Parte Doody [1994] 1 AC 531 and Richard Dickson Ogendo & 2 others vs.Attorney General & 5 others (2014)eKLR.






29.
Counsel on the second issue, relying in Coalition for Reform and democracy & 2 others vs. Republic & 10 others (2015)eKLR submitted that Sections 44(1) & (2), 58 and 60(1) & (3) of the Tax Procedure Act are unconstitutional as violate Article 31(b) of 
the Constitution
. This is because these Sections permit the 1
st
 Respondent to unilaterally and arbitrarily seize tax payer’s possessions.






30.
Moreover, Counsel submitted Section 56(1) of the Act unlawfully shifts the burden of proof to the Petitioners contrary to Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 and Article 50(2) of 
the Constitution
 hence unconstitutional.






31.
Counsel added that Sections 59 and 60 (10) of the Act purport to limit the Petitioners constitutional rights yet no justification in line with Article 24 of 
the Constitution
 is demonstrated. In essence Counsel submitted that the Sections are unconstitutional as allow the 1
st
 Respondent to obtain private and privileged communication between parties in violation of Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 and the 
Evidence Act
.






32.
Concluding, Counsel submitted that the Petitioners were entitled to compensation as discussed in Otieno Mak’ Onyango vs Attorney General & another (2012) eKLR owing to the breach of their constitutional rights.






33.
In light of exemplary damages, Counsel urged the Court to appreciate that the 1
st
 Petitioner had a good reputation prior to the charges against him. These charges were adjudged to be malicious and as a result had caused the Petitioners to lose their business. In the end, the 1
st
 Petitioner was subjected to shame and economic loss. For this Reason, Counsel urged the Court to allow the Petition.








1
st
 Respondent’s Submissions


34.
Counsel, Sheila Sanga filed submissions dated 4
th
 November 2019, where the key issues for determination were identified as: whether the Petitioners rights under Article 25(1), 28, 29, 31, 47 and 49 of 
the Constitution
 were violated; whether Sections 44(1) & (2), 56(1), 58, 59, 60 (1)-(3),(10), 99 of the Tax Procedure Act, 2015 are unconstitutional; and whether the reliefs sought should be granted.






35.
To commence with Counsel submitted that the 1
st
 Respondent had not violated the Petitioners constitutional rights as alleged. It was stated that all actions taken by the 1
st
 Respondent albeit seemed adverse in the 1
st
 Petitioner’s view, all were sanctioned by the law and done within its confines. Counsel highlighted that constitutional rights save for those under Article 25 of 
the Constitution
 are not absolute and thus can be limited in line with Article 24 of 
the Constitution
.






36.
Counsel on the allegation that the 1
st
 Petitioner’s right to dignity and freedom of security of person was violated submitted that the 1
st
 Petitioner had voluntarily gone to the 1
st
 Respondent following its call. Nonetheless it was noted that holding of the 1
st
 Petitioner was sanctioned by the dictates of Section 7 of the Tax Procedure Act.






37.
Equally allegations of torture were not established by the 1
st
 Petitioner. In addition, it was argued that the 1
st
 Petitioner was required to prove the allegation by establishing the principles set out in G4S Security Services (Kenya) Limited vs Domitila Katila & another (2017) eKLR.






38.
Further reliance was placed in Monica Wamere vs Attorney General (2019) eKLR and Dennis Itumbi v Attorney General & 2 others (2018) eKLR.






39.
Counsel held similar sentiments with regards to violation of the Petitioners right to privacy. It was noted that the 1
st
 Respondent was compelled to seek the information as the 1
st
 Petitioner had refused to cooperate with its officers. The action moreover was supported by the law and in public interest. Reliance was placed in Coalition for Reform and Democracy & 2 others v Republic &10 others (2015) eKLR where it was held that:
“
A right to privacy can never be absolute….what needs to be done is to subject the limitation and the purposes it is intended to serve to a balancing test, whose aim is to determine whether the intrusion into an individual’s privacy is proportionate to the public interest to be served by the intrusion.”






40.
Counsel further noted that the 1
st
 Petitioner was accorded sufficient time and notice before any action was taken by the 1
st
 Respondent in line with the right to a fair administrative action. It was argued rather that it was the 1
st
 Petitioner who failed to uphold this right when he was called upon. Reliance was placed in Mutungi Ngulo v Pan African Insurance Company Ltd & 4 others (2019) eKLR where it was held that:
“
The law is not that a party must be heard in every litigation. The law is that parties must be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard and once that opportunity is not utilized then the only point on which the party not utilizing the opportunity can be heard is why he did not utilize it.”






41.
Counsel as well stressed that the 1
st
 Petitioner’s allegations on his arrest were baseless and full of falsehoods. It is stressed that the 1
st
 Petitioner was informed of the reasons for his arrest and was not barred from communicating with anyone. Further the 1
st
 Petitioner was all thorough represented by an advocate. For this allegation to hold water therefore Counsel stressed that the 1
st
 Petitioner ought to prove the same as held in Leonard Otieno v Airtel Kenya Limited (2018) eKLR.






42.
On the constitutionality of the impugned provisions, Counsel submitted that this Court in answering this issue should be guided by the principles of statutory interpretation. First, the principle of constitutionality as held in Okiya Ontatah Okoiti v Attorney General & another (2018)eKLR. Second the object and purpose of the impugned Sections as determined in R V Big M. Drug Mart LTD. (1985)1 S.C.R. 295.






43.
Equally Counsel submitted that since the impugned provisions are challenged based on the fact that they violate 
the Constitution
, this Court should also consider the principles of constitutional interpretation as set out under Article 259 of 
the Constitution
. In Counsel’s view an interrogation of the impugned Sections against these principles reveal that the Sections are constitutional.






44.
Turning to the reliefs sought, in particular the order of certiorari, Counsel submitted that the notices of assessment were issued in line with the procedure set out in law under Section 31 of the Tax Procedure Act. Before they were effected, the 1
st
 Petitioner had an opportunity to object the same pursuant to Section 51 of the Act. The 1
st
 Petitioner in this regard did not object the notices in accordance with the law thus failing to exhaust the remedies already available before invoking this Court’s jurisdiction.






45.
Reliance was placed in Republic V Commissioner for Domestic Taxes & 2 Others Ex Parte Samuel Kimondo Theuri [2016] EKLR where it was held that:
“
However, the Applicant was expected to lodge an objection to the assessment within 30 days of the date of the assessment thereof. Again, it is clear this was not done…Once the Respondent had communicated in August 2010 that tax was due it was incumbent upon the Applicant to lodge an appeal within the stipulated or specified period under Section 229. That was not done.”






46.
Counsel further submitted that the Petitioners had not proved their case to the effect that the 1
st
 Respondent in carrying out its mandate acted ultra vires and in bad faith. As such, there was not justifiable reasons for these orders to issue. On the contrary Counsel argued that the Petition was made in bad faith intent on frustrating the due process of the law.






47.
On the sought compensation of Ksh.24,000,000/-, Counsel submitted that the Petitioners had not proved their case and thus do not deserve this award. Moreover, it was noted that special damages must not only be claimed specially but proved strictly as held in Gitobu Imayara & 2 others v Attorney General (2016) eKLR.








3
rd
, 4
th
 and 5
th
 Respondents’ Submissions


48.
State Counsel, Christopher Marwa file submissions dated 28
th
 June 2021 in support of these Respondents case. Counsel identified the issues for determination as: whether the Respondents violated the Petitioners’ rights under Article 25(a), 28, 29, 31, 47 and 49 of 
the Constitution
; whether Sections 44 (1) & (2), 56 (1), 58, 59, 60 (1) – (3), (10), 99 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015 are unconstitutional; and whether the Petitioners are entitled to the remedies sought.






49.
According to Counsel, the Petition does not disclose any reasonable cause of action against these Respondents. Counsel as well argued that the Petition was not pleaded with specificity and precision as is required for constitutional petitions as held in Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance & 5 others [2013] eKLR.






50.
Counsel submitted that the Petitioners’ case that 1
st
 Respondent utilized the Petitioners bank statements to register caveats on its properties could not hold water as the right to privacy is not absolute. Reliance was placed in Stephen Kariuki Kamau & 5 Others Vs Kenya Ports Authority & 6 Others (2016) eKLR where it was held that:
“
I have cited at length the case law and comparable statutory provisions which indicate that though a patient’s medical record or information is protected under Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010, there are circumstances in which such information may be divulged to a third party because the right to privacy is not absolute.”






51.
It was additionally submitted that the Petitioners had not established any constitutional violation and neither was any evidence adduced to support the claims of torture, cruelty, inhuman and degrading treatment as occasioned by the Respondents. In support reliance was placed in Peter Njuguna Mwangi & 2 others v Attorney General [2017] eKLR where it was held that:
“
Aside from the fact that no torture has been proved as relates to the events of 3
rd
 March 1992, in fact no evidence of an unlawful action after that date has also been given. The almost a yearlong alleged torture would certainly have had long term effects on the Petitioners either physically or psychologically but no evidence in that regard was even alluded to let alone placed before me. That prayer must therefore fail.”






52.
On the alleged unconstitutionality of the impugned Sections, Counsel stressed that it is a general principle that all statutes are presumed constitutional. Therefore, the one who claims otherwise should prove the same which the Petitioners failed to do. Reliance was placed in Federation of Women Lawyers Kenya (FIDA) v Attorney General & another [2018] eKLR where it was held that:
“
Admittedly, there is the general presumption that every Act of Parliament is Constitutional and the burden of proof lies on every person who alleges otherwise. (The court should start by assuming that the Act in question is Constitutional). Discussing the presumption of Constitutionality of a statute, the Supreme Court of India stated that:-“In examining the Constitutionality of a statute it must be assumed that the legislature understands and appreciates the need of the people and the law it enacts are directed to problems which are made manifest by experience and the elected representatives assembled in a legislature enact laws which they consider to be reasonable for the purpose for which they are enacted. Presumption is, therefore, in favour of the Constitutionality of an enactment.”






53.
Counsel as well appreciated that in determining this question the Court should examine the object and purpose of the impugned Sections. This is so as to discern the intention of the Act as stated in Council of County Governors v Attorney General & another [2017] eKLR. In Counsel’s view, the Petitioners failed to demonstrate how the impugned Sections are unconstitutional and also failed to particularize which provision of 
the Constitution
 the sections offend. To this end Counsel submitted that since the Petitioners failed to establish their case, they were not entitled to the reliefs sought.








Analysis and Determination


54.
It is my considered view that the issues that arise for determination in this matter are as follows:
i.
Whether Sections 44 (1) & (2), 56 (1), 58, 59, 60 (1), (3) & (10), 99 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015 are unconstitutional;
ii.
Whether the Respondents’ violated the Petitioners’ constitutional rights under Article 25(a), 28, 29, 31, 47 and 49 of 
the Constitution
; and
iii.
Whether Petitioners are entitled to the relief sought.








Whether Sections 44 (1) & (2), 56 (1), 58, 59, 60 (1), (3) & (10), 99 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015 are unconstitutional;


55.
Constitutionality of a Statute should be guided by the principles of constitutional interpretation set out under Article 259 of 
the Constitution
. Further, Article 159 (2) (e) requires that while exercising judicial authority, Courts protect and promote the purposes and principles of 
the Constitution
. In this case, this Court is required to determine the constitutionality of a statutory provision. Article 2 (4) of 
the Constitution
 provides that
’’Any law, including customary law, that is inconsistent with this Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency, and any act or omission in contravention of this Constitution is invalid.’’






56.
This Court (the High Court) is clothed with the jurisdiction under Article 165 (3) (d) (i) to determine ‘whether any law is inconsistent with or in contravention of 
the Constitution
’.






57.
Courts have consistently applied various tested principles in constitutional interpretation. The Court of Appeal in Center for Rights Education and Awareness & Another v John Harun Mwau & 6 others [2012] eKLR summarized Article 259 which deal with principles to apply in constitutional interpretation as follows:
“
a.
It should be interpreted in a manner that promotes its purposes, values and principles; advances rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms and permits development of the law and contributes to good governance as provided by Article 259.
b.
The spirit and tenor of 
the Constitution
 must preside and permeate the process of judicial interpretation and judicial discretion.
c.
It must be interpreted broadly, liberally and purposively so as to avoid “the austerity of tabulated legalism.”
d.
The entire Constitution has to be read as an integrated whole and no one particular provision destroying the other but each sustaining the other as to effectuate the great purpose of the instrument (the harmonization principle).”






58.
The other fundamental principle of Constitutional interpretation was underscored by the Court of Appeal of Tanzania in Ndyanabo vs. Attorney General [2001] EA 495 itself a restatement of the law from the English case of Pearlberg vs. Varty [1972] 1 WLR 534 where it was held as follows:
“
Until the contrary is proved, legislation is presumed to be constitutional. It is a sound principle of constitutional construction that, if possible, legislation should receive such a construction as will make it operative and not inoperative”






59.
The presumption of constitutionality of a statute was also pithily elaborated by the Supreme Court of India in Hamdard Dawakhana vs. Union of India Air (1960) AIR 554, 1960 SCR (2)671 as follows:
“
In examining the Constitutionality of a statute, it must be assumed that the legislature understands and appreciates the need of the people and the law it enacts are directed to problems which are made manifest by experience and the elected representatives assembled in a legislature enact laws which they consider to be reasonable for the purpose for which they are enacted. Presumption is, therefore, in favour of the Constitutionality of an enactment.”






60.
The object and effect principle is another mode of Constitutional Interpretation as held in Geoffrey Andare v Attorney General & 2 others [2016] eKLR where the Court opined thus:
“
It has also been held that in determining the constitutionality of a statute, a court must be guided by the object and purpose of the impugned statute, which object and purpose can be discerned from the legislation itself. The Supreme Court of Canada in R vs Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 enunciated this principle as follows:
“Both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality; either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate legislation. All legislation is animated by an object the legislature intends to achieve. This object is realized through impact produced by the operation and application of the legislation. Purpose and effect respectively, in the sense of the legislation’s object and its ultimate impact, are clearly linked, if not indivisible. Intended and achieved effects have been looked to for guidance in assessing the legislation’s object and thus the validity.”






61.
This same principle was also applied by the Constitutional Court of Uganda in Olum and another vs Attorney General [2002] 2 EA, where it was noted that:
“
To determine the constitutionality of a section of a statute or Act of Parliament, the court has to consider the purpose and effect of the impugned statute or section thereof. If its purpose does not infringe a right guaranteed by 
the constitution
, the court has to go further and examine the effect of the implementation. If either its purpose or the effect of its implementation infringes a right guaranteed by 
the constitution
, the impugned statute or section thereof shall be declared unconstitutional…”






62.
The Court in Council of County Governors v Attorney General & another [2017] eKLR highlights another mode of interpretating the Constitutionality of a Statute by examining the object, effect and the history of the Statute.
“
A law which violates 
the constitution
 is void. In such cases, the Court has to examine as to what factors the court should weigh while determining the constitutionality of a statute. The court should examine the provisions of the statute in light of the provisions of 
the Constitution
. When the constitutionality of a law is challenged on grounds that it infringes 
the constitution
, what the court has to consider is the “direct and inevitable effect” of such law. Further, in order to examine the constitutionality or otherwise of statute or any of its provisions, one of the most relevant consideration is the object and reasons as well as legislative history of the statute. This would help the court in arriving at a more objective and justifiable approach.
Thus, the history behind the enactment in question should be borne in mind. Thus any interpretation of these provisions should bear in mind the history, the desires and aspirations of the Kenyans on whom 
the Constitution
 vests the sovereign power, bearing in mind that sovereign power is only delegated to the institutions which exercise it and that the said institutions which include Parliament, the national executive and executive structures in the county governments, and the judiciary must exercise this power only in accordance with 
the Constitution
.”






63.
Cognizant of the above principles, it is now my cardinal duty to evaluate the provisions of the Statute that the Petitioner alleges are unconstitutional and determine if that is so.






64.
The Petitioner contended that Sections 44 (1) & 2, 56 (1), 58, 59, 60 and 99 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 2015 are unconstitutional. The Petitioner faulted Section 44 (1) and (2) and 60 (1) & (3) of the Act for violating Article 31 (b) of 
the Constitution
 allegedly because they permit the 1
st
 Respondent to unilaterally and arbitrary permit tax payer’s possessions. In regard to section 56 (1) of 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015, the Petitioner claimed that it is unconstitutional for shifting the burden of proof to the taxpayer in contravention of Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
. For Section 59 and 60 of 
Tax procedures Act
, 2015 ; the Petitioner argued that it limits the fundamental rights by permitting the 1
st
 Respondent to demand private and privileged communication between parties including Advocate/client information in violation of Article 31 (d) of 
the Constitution
 and Article 137 of the 
Evidence Act
 without meeting the threshold set in Article 24.






65.
The 1
st
 Respondent denied and countered the allegations of unconstitutionality fronted by the Respondent blow by blow as already captured during the review of the Respondent’s case.






66.
The rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights save for those specified in Article 25 (namely, freedom from torture, and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude, the right to fair trial and right to an order of habeas corpus) can limited as long as the limitation meets the conditions set out in Article 24. The Constitutional requirement is that the limitation must be reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom and taking into account relevant factors including:
a.
The importance and purpose of limitation
b.
Nature and extent of limitation
c.
The need to ensure that the enjoyment of rights and fundamental freedoms by any individual does not prejudice the rights and fundamental freedom of others; and
d.
The relation between the limitation and its purpose and whether there are less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.
It is however worth noting that Article 24 (2) (c) also has a proviso underscores that despite clause (1) permitting limitation of a right or fundamental freedom, such limitation shall not limit the right or fundamental freedom so far as to derogate from the core or essential content.






67.
The reasonableness or otherwise of a limitation that is a permissible derogation of the right or fundamental right in question cannot be determined without undertaking a proper analysis that considers the objective and effect of the challenged legal provision.






68.
It goes without saying that 
the Constitution
 in Articles 201, 209 and 210 has given the national government the power to impose taxes specified in Article 209 (1) of 
the Constitution
 or any other tax as may be authorized by legislation as per Article 209 (2). County governments also have the power to levy taxes is per Article 209 (3) a, b & c of 
the Constitution
. Article 210 (1) is categorical that no tax or licensing fee may be imposed, waived or varied except as provided for in legislation.






69.
The 
Tax Procedures Act
 Cap 469 B is the means or medium through which the tax collector in exercise of Constitutional obligation to collect tax is able to ensure compliance is attained.
Section 2 to be as follows:
2.
Object and purpose of the Act
(1)
The object and purpose of this Act is to provide uniform procedures for—
(a)
consistency and efficiency in the administration of tax laws;
(b)
facilitation of tax compliance by taxpayers; and
(c)
effective and efficient collection of tax.






70.
From the reading of Section 2 above, the intended objective is made clear, it is to attain effective and efficient collection of tax and facilitation of compliance by tax payers. It is against this background my analysis begins.






71.
Turning now to the specific provisions of the Act that the Petitioner singled out as being unconstitutional, I will start with Section 44 and 60 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. The Section provides:
44.
Seizure and forfeiture of goods
(1)
This section shall apply to—
(a)
any goods in respect of which the Commissioner or authorised officer reasonably believes that the value added tax or excise duty payable in respect of the supply, removal, or import of the goods has not been or will not be paid; or
(b)
goods for which excise duty has not been paid, unless the owner of the goods has made arrangements that have satisfied the Commissioner for the payment of the excise duty, which may include the giving of a security;
(c)
excisable goods subject to excise control that have been moved, altered, or in any way interfered with, except with the permission of the Commissioner;
(d)
excisable goods in respect of which, any person, in any matter relating to excise, makes or produces a declaration, certificate, application or other document, answer, statement or representation, that is false or incorrect in any particular; or
(e)
excisable goods in respect of which a refund of excise duty has been unlawfully obtained.
(2)
The Commissioner or an authorised officer may seize any goods to which this section applies.
(3)
The goods seized under this section shall be stored in a place approved by the Commissioner or authorised officer.
(4)
Subject to subsection (5), when goods have been seized under this section, the Commissioner or authorised officer shall, as soon as practicable after the seizure and having regard to the condition of the goods, serve the owner of the goods or the person who had custody or control of the goods immediately before their seizure, a notice in writing—
(a)
identifying the goods;
(b)
stating that the goods have been seized under this section and the reason for seizure;
(c)
setting out the terms for the release or disposal of the goods; and
(d)
stating that the goods maybe forfeited to the Commissioner if they are not claimed in accordance with subsection (7).
(5)
The Commissioner or authorised officer shall not be required to serve a notice under this section if, after making reasonable enquiries, the Commissioner or authorised officer has insufficient information to identify the person on whom the notice should be served.
(6)
When the Commissioner or authorised officer is unable to serve the notice on the person who is required to be served under this section, the Commissioner or authorised officer may serve the notice on the person who claims the goods if that person has given sufficient information to enable the notice to be served.
(7)
The Commissioner or authorised officer may authorise that goods that have been seized under this section be delivered to the person on whom a notice has been served when that person has paid, or has given security for the payment of, the tax due and payable, or that will become due and payable, in respect of the goods.
(8)
If the tax due and payable, or the tax that will become due and payable, has not been paid and security for the payment of the tax has not been given, the Commissioner or authorised officer shall detain the seized goods—
(a)
in the case of perishable goods, for a period that the Commissioner or authorised officer considers reasonable having regard to the condition of the goods; or
(b)
in any other case—
(i)
for ten days after the seizure of the goods; or
(ii)
for ten days after the due date for payment of the tax due in respect of the supply, removal, or import of the goods, whichever is the earlier.
(9)
Where the detention period under subsection (8) has expired, the goods shall be forfeited to the Commissioner.
(10)
The Commissioner or authorised officer may sell forfeited goods in the manner specified in section 41(6) and apply the proceeds of the sale of the forfeited goods in the following order—
(a)
towards the cost of taking, keeping, and selling the forfeited goods;
(b)
towards the payment of the Value Added Tax or excise duty that is, or will become, payable in respect of the supply, removal, or import of the goods; and
(c)
the remainder of the proceeds, if any, shall be retained by the Commissioner.
(11)
When the proceeds of the disposal of forfeited goods are less than the total of the tax payable in respect of the supply, removal or import of the goods and cost of taking, keeping, and selling the forfeited goods, the Commissioner may proceed to recover the shortfall from the owner of the goods or the person who had custody or control of the goods immediately before they were seized as if the shortfall was a tax payable by that person.






72.
Further, Section 60 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 which the Petitioner faults as being unconstitutional states:
“


60.
) In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.
(2)
An appeal to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal shall be on a question of law only.
(3)
In an appeal by a taxpayer to the Tribunal, High Court or Court of Appeal in relation to an appealable decision, the taxpayer shall rely only on the grounds stated in the objection to which the decision relates unless the Tribunal or Court allows the person to add new grounds.








73.
The Petitioner assaulted section 44 (1) and (2) and 60 (1)- (3) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 stating that they allow unilateral and arbitrary seizure of the tax-payers possessions thereby demeaning the dignity and the spirit of victims subjected to such actions.






74.
On reading and understanding of the two sections, I am unable to agree with the Petitioner’s contention. Section 44 (1) & (2) is coached to is applicable when there is reasonable believe that value added tax or excise duty has not been paid or will not be paid in respect of the subject matter under investigation. In the instant case for instance, the 1
st
 Respondent deposed that its actions were informed by intelligence reports and upon conducting its preliminary investigations it found that income to the tune of Kshs.583,322,534 had been received by the petitioners but the taxes due were never remitted. Further, once the 1
st
 Respondent seizure is done by the 1
st
 Respondent, he is obliged to serve their owner a notice of seizure in writing and the recipient of the notice can lay a claim. It thus means that the section has an inbuilt mechanism that provides the owner a reasonable opportunity to contest their seizure. For Section 60, it is clear that procedure under the said section can only be commenced by obtaining a court warrant. The involvement of the Court is meant to ensure and curb arbitrariness as the Court must ascertain the presence of reasonable cause before such a warrant can issue. The duty imposed on the Court to issue warrant is a safeguard to protect the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual and the Court has to assess if a reasonable basis has been established to limit the rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned in the manner proposed.






75.
In my view, both Section 44 and 60 have intrinsic safeguards that prevent arbitrariness by proportionately striking a fair balance between the taxpayer rights and tax collector’s obligations under the law hence it is my finding that they are not unconstitutional. They ensure that tax is lawfully collected while respecting the rights of the taxpayer through by providing that seizure notice must premised on reasonable belief that there is tax due has not or will not be paid hence it needs to be proved that there were circumstances that reasonably created that belief. suspicion. There is also the requirement that the owner of goods is granted an opportunity to challenge the seizure notice. Section 60 is involving judicial process which as alluded to is a potential safeguard against arbitrariness. The claim that Section 44 and 60 violate Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 is thus untenable.






76.
The Petitioner also challenged section 56 for placing the burden on the tax payer who is making an objection or appealing by claiming that it is against the general law of application and 
the Constitution
 to shift the onus on the taxpayer. This section is on objections and appeals and reads as follows:
Section 5
(1)
In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.
(2)
An appeal to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal shall be on a question of law only.
(3)
In an appeal by a taxpayer to the Tribunal, High Court or Court of Appeal in relation to an appealable decision, the taxpayer shall rely only on the grounds stated in the objection to which the decision relates unless the Tribunal or Court allows the person to add new grounds.






77.
The Petitioner submitted on this point as follows:
“
Section 56 (1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015 is unconstitutional whereas it shifts the burden of proof to the Petitioner…Section 56 (1) of 
tax procedures Act
 is unconstitutional for shifting the burden of proof to tax-payers in contravention of Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 and Article 50 (2) of 
the Constitution
…”






78.
The argument is not legally sound. Evidently, this is a tax enforcement statute aimed at assisting in collection of tax. The procedure referred to in Section 56 does not relate to a criminal proceeding but an objection to a tax decision. The presumption of innocence under Article 50 (2) (a) of 
the Constitution
 relates to the legal burden in criminal cases. It specifically begins by stating that
‘Every person accused has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to-
a)
to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved’






79.
This rule does not automatically apply in civil cases where the burden of proof can be fixed by law or as a matter of fairness. For instance, despite the Petitioner hyping Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
, he equally forgets that that there is Section 112 of the same Act that places the burden of proof on the person who has special knowledge of particular facts. Again, we have presumptions that shift the burden in particular circumstances. This point was very well illustrated by the Court of Appeal in the case of Stanley Mombo Awiti vs Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (2019) eKLR where the challenge was mounted that 
Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act
 had shifted the burden of proof by requiring the person suspected of possession unexplained assets to forfeit it unless he could provide a sufficient explanation. The Court held:
“
…The appellant urged his right to be presumed innocent under Article 50 (2) (a) of 
the Constitution
 was violated as the court shifted the burden of proof and required him to prove his innocence. It was submitted that the appellant was not informed in advance of the evidence in possession of the respondent because the forfeited properties were neither listed nor enumerated in the Notice dated 9
th
 July 2008…. Section 55 (2) of the Act make provision for evidentiary burden which is cast upon the person under investigation to provide satisfactory explanation to establish the legitimate origin of his/her assets. This evidentiary burden is a dynamic burden of proof requiring one who is better able to prove a fact to be the one to prove it. Section 55 (2) of ACECA is in sync with Section 112 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 of the Laws of Kenya. Section 112 of the 
Evidence Act
, (Cap 80 of the Laws of Kenya) provides:
“In civil proceedings when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any party to those proceedings the burden of proving or disproving that fact is upon him.”


79.
Under Section 55 (2) of ACECA, the theme in evidentiary burden in relation to unexplained assets is prove it or lose it. In other words, an individual has the evidentiary burden to offer satisfactory explanation for legitimate acquisition of the asset or forfeit such asset. The cornerstone for forfeiture proceedings of unexplained assets is having assets disproportionate to known legitimate source of income. Tied to this is the inability of an individual to satisfactorily explain the disproportionate assets. A forfeiture order under ACECA is brought against unexplained assets which is tainted property; if legitimate acquisition of such property is not satisfactorily explained, such tainted property risk categorization as property that has been unlawfully acquired. The requirement to explain assets is not a requirement for one to explain his innocence. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental right that cannot be displaced through a Notice to explain how assets have been acquired…”








80.
The 1
st
 Respondent argued that the tax decision is made up of audit findings and workings by the Commissioner (1
st
 Respondent) hence it is natural for the taxpayer who is objecting to the decision to be the one to assault that decision. Prudence and fairness would in my view demand that under those circumstances the legal requirement on allocation of burden is quite reasonable and should not be disturbed. I do not find the allegation of unconstitutionality of Section 56 (1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 established. It does not have any relationship to Article 50 (2) (a) of 
the Constitution
 either.






81.
There was also the allegation that Section 58 of 
Tax Procedures Act
 is unconstitutional because it allows arbitrary search of tax payers properties while Section 59 purports to limit the fundamental rights without meeting the threshold under Article 24 of 
the Constitution
. It was argued by the Petitioner that his client-advocate privilege was violated yet it is to be maintained even after the death of the Advocate. The two sections state as follows:
58.
Power to inspect goods, records, etc.
1.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any written law, an authorised officer may inquire into the affairs of a person under any tax law, and shall at all times have full and free access to all lands, buildings, places to inspect all goods, equipment, devices and records, whether in the custody or control of a public officer, or of a body corporate or of any other person, and may make extracts from or copies of those records.
2.
An officer acting under subsection (1) may require the owner or employee, or a representative of the owner of the business, to give him all assistance and to answer all questions relating to the inquiry.
59.
Production of records
1.
For the purposes of obtaining full information in respect of the tax liability of any person or class of persons, or for any other purposes relating to a tax law, the ommissioner or an authorised officer may require any person, by notice in writing, to—
a.
produce for examination, at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, any documents (including in electronic format) that are in the person's custody or under the person's control relating to the tax liability of any person;
b.
furnish information relating to the tax liability of any person in the manner and by the time as specified in the notice; or
(c)
attend, at the time and place specified in the notice, for the purpose of giving evidence in respect of any matter or transaction appearing to be relevant to the tax liability of any person.
2.
If the person required to produce documents under subsection (1)(a) is a financial institution—
a.
the documents shall not, while they are being examined, be removed from the premises of the financial institution or other premises at which they are produced;
b.
the Commissioner or authorised officer carrying out the examination may make copies of such documents for the purposes of any report relating to the examination; and
(c)
the confidentiality of the information obtained in the course of the examination by the Commissioner or authorised officer shall be maintained and the information shall be used solely for the purposes of the tax laws.
3.
The Commissioner or authorised officer may require that the information referred to in subsection (1) be—
(a)
given on oath, verbally or in writing, and, for that purpose, the Commissioner or authorised officer may administer the oath; or
(b)
verified by a statutory declaration or in any other manner that the Commissioner may prescribe.
4.
This section shall have effect despite—
(a)
any law relating to privilege or the public interest with respect to the giving of information or the production of any documents (including in electronic format); or
(b)
any contractual duty of confidentiality.






82.
The 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya protects the advocate-client communication. It provides at section 137 as follows:
“
…No one shall be compelled to disclose to the Court any confidential communication which has taken place between him and his Advocate unless he offers himself as a witness, in which case he may be compelled to disclose any such communications as may appear to the Court necessary to be known in order to explain any evidence which he has given, but not others…”
The Advocate-client confidentiality under Section 137 of the 
Evidence Act
 and the disclosure requirements permitted under Section 59 and Section 60 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 are not in conflict with each other. Section 59 and 60 applies in instances where there is reasonable cause to belief that a tax-payer is non-compliant in fulfilling his/her tax obligations. Section 137 of the 
Evidence Act
 does shield from disclosure communication between an advocate and the client if the information is not given in furtherance of an illegal purpose. Such information cannot be protected where there is reasonable basis that it was intended to conceal non-payment of tax. In that case, public interest would demand that disclosure be made.








Whether the Rights and Fundamental Rights of the 1
st
 Petitioner were violated by the 1
st
 Respondent


83.
A constitutional petition must meet the threshold of specificity and precision requirement in pleading the constitutional rights violated and the manner of infringement by the Respondents as against the Petitioner. This test was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Communications Commission of Kenya & 5 others v Royal Media Services Limited & 5 others [2014] eKLR as follows:
“
(349)
…. Although Article 22(1) of 
the Constitution
 gives every person the right to initiate proceedings claiming that a fundamental right or freedom has been denied, violated or infringed or threatened, a party invoking this Article has to show the rights said to be infringed, as well as the basis of his or her grievance. This principle emerges clearly from the High Court decision in Anarita Karimi Njeru vs Republic, (1979) KLR 154: the necessity of a link between the aggrieved party, the provisions of 
the Constitution
 alleged to have been contravened, and the manifestation of contravention or infringement. Such a principle plays a positive role, as a foundation of conviction and good faith, in engaging the constitutional process of dispute settlement…”






84.
In the same way, the Court of Appeal stressed this position in Mumo Matemu (supra) as follows:
“
(42)
It was the High Court’s observation that the petition before it was not the “epitome of precise, comprehensive, or elegant drafting.” Yet the principle in Anarita Karimi Njeru (supra) underscores the importance of defining the dispute to be decided by the court. In our view, it is a misconception to claim as it has been in recent times with increased frequency that compliance with rules of procedure is antithetical to Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 and the overriding objective principle under Section 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 (Cap 21) and Section 3A and 3B of the 
Appellate Jurisdiction Act
 (Cap 9). Procedure is also a handmaiden of just determination of cases. Cases cannot be dealt with justly unless the parties and the court know the issues in controversy. Pleadings assist in that regard and are a tenet of substantive justice, as they give fair notice to the other party. The principle in Anarita Karimi Njeru (supra) that established the rule that requires reasonable precision in framing of issues in constitutional petitions is an extension of this principle.”






85.
Similarly, the Petitioners are obliged to discharge the first burden of proof as stipulated under Sections 107 of the 
Evidence Act
. In this regard the Court in Evans Otieno Nyakwana vs Cleophas Bwana Ongaro (2015) eKLR held that:
“


15.
… As a general proposition the legal burden of proof lies upon the party who invokes the aid of the law and substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. That is the purport of section 107(1) of the 
Evidence Act
 (Chapter 80 of the Laws of Kenya)…






16.
Furthermore, the evidential burden that is cast upon any party the burden of proving any particular fact which he desires the court to believe in its existence. That is captured in sections 109 and 112 of the Act as follows:
109.
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.








86.
Given the above, the fundamental question is whether the Petitioners have established that their rights and fundamental freedoms pleaded in the Petition have been violated.






87.
The Petitioner alleged that the right to freedom and security of the person under Article 29 was infringed by the Respondent’s Act of depriving him his freedom for a number of hours for two days, subjected him to criminal charges causing him untold physical and psychological torture for failure to produce documents relating to tax compliance which he was willing to tender had he been given the time to get them from the firm of the deceased advocate.






88.
The 1
st
 Respondent refuted the presentation of facts by the 1
st
 Petitioner rebutting the presentation of facts by the Petitioner. The 1
st
 Respondent stated that upon getting intelligence reports and conducting preliminary investigations that showed the Petitioners had received colossal income amounting to Kshs. 583, 322, 534 and had not filed any tax returns which amounts to an offence under Section 97 (e) as read with Section 104 (3) of 
Tax Procedures Act
, the 1
st
 Respondent contacted the 1
st
 Petitioner on 23/1/2018 via his known mobile number it was not picked. This made the 1
st
 Respondent to write a letter ‘JF 2’ on 28
th
 February, 2018 inviting him to their office to discuss the issue. The 1
st
 Respondent also contacted Violet Akinyi (1
st
 Petitioner’s wife) who is also listed as a Director of Lewar Ventures and Lipepixac Supplies- the 18
th
 and 19
th
 Petitioners to attend the meeting to discuss their tax affairs. Violet agreed to meet the 1
st
 Respondent on 1
st
 March, 2018 which was followed with email confirmation but she did not avail herself.






89.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s effort to reach out to the 1
st
 Petitioner and his wife did not materialize as they remained unbothered and uncooperative during investigation stage. The other directors were contacted George Okoth Okello who was a director in 6
th
, 15
th
 and 20
th
 Petitioners and Xlyn Omonge denied connection with the Companies claiming his registration details has been obtained fraudulently and provided a statement and sample signatures. Stephen Ouma also listed as a Director claimed as such. Xlyn Omonge did not turn up. The 1
st
 Respondent sought information available through 3
rd
 Parties and issued tax assessment on 16
th
 March, 2018 pursuant to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015.






90.
That is when the 1
st
 Petitioner on 25 March, 2018 responded through email ‘JE 7’ acknowledging the receipt of the letter of 16
th
 March, 2018. He requested for 90 days and committed to address the issues raised but never provided the documents or clarifications required. The 1
st
 Respondent issued notices of assessment dated 7
th
 June 2018 and there was no objection filed by the Petitioner per Section 51 of 
Tax Procedures Act
 (see JE 8). The 1
st
 Respondent upon completion of investigation that various tax offences had been committed by the Petitioners and was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution. It was then that it invited the Directors for statement recording. Consequently, the 1
st
 Respondent states that the 1
st
 Petitioner was accorded an opportunity to be heard but failed to utilize it.






91.
That the 1
st
 Petitioner was arrested by the DCI officers based at the 1
st
 Respondent and was informed about the reason of his arrest was defaulting in tax obligation contrary to Section 97 (e) as read with Section 104 (3) which is an offence under the 
Tax Procedures Act
. The 1
st
 Respondent denied claims of torture following the arrest of the Petitioner. The 1
st
 Respondent thus accused the 1
st
 Petitioner of insincerity.






92.
Despite very damning allegations in regard to the 1
st
 Petitioner’s uncooperative posture and his failure to honour the commitment made with the 1
st
 Respondent to provide details of information requested about his companies, there was no supplementary affidavit that was filed by the 1
st
 Petitioner to counter the 1
st
 Respondent’s deposition about the 1
st
 Petitioner’s conduct which prompted the 1
st
 Respondent to cause his arrest for purposes of prosecution for the offences that the investigation had detected. In my view, the duty to obey the law is not optional for any citizen. When non-confrontational approach is applied to ensure compliance with the law has been extended but is totally ignored as was the case here, the only remaining option is to use legally compulsive means to effect an arrest provided that it is reasonably executed. Section 7 (1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 confers authorized officers of the 1
st
 Respondent for purposes of administering tax law with all the duties, powers, rights, privileges and protection of a police officer. In my view, the arrest was not arbitrarily executed without a just cause hence was not a violation of Article 29 (1) of 
the Constitution
.






93.
In the circumstances of this case, I am unable to find any evidence to fault the arrest of the 1
st
 Petitioner which was justified due to persistent refusal to submit to the 1
st
 Respondent despite investigations finding a sufficient basis to prefer tax related offences. I find that the action taken by the 1
st
 Respondent was proportionate to secure compliance with the law and thus did not amount to violation of the 1
st
 Petitioner freedom and security of the person as alleged. Equally, there was no evidence of torture that was adduced.






94.
On violation of right to privacy, the Petitioner alleged that the 1
st
 Respondent unilaterally acquired bank statements of the petitioners and used the same to calculate alleged tax arrears and issued agency notices with a bid to recovering the arrears. Counsel for the Petitioner thus argued:
“
… Section 31 of the Value Added Tax permits warrantless entry into person’s premises on the basis of reasonable grounds established that the Act is not being complied. Under Section 31 (2) the Commissioner is only entitled to take possession and remove any record, books of accounts or other documents when he has reasonable grounds for suspecting they contain evidence of the commission of any offence under the Act… A warrantless search is a limitation to the right of privacy as it contravenes the standard established at article 24. The burden to establish that the conduct complained of meets the standards established by Article 24 is borne by the Party justifying the limitation, that is the Respondents in this case…The obligation of the State to collect taxes by law must be balanced with that of the individual right to privacy and dignity and in balancing these rights, the State must justify its actions. ..The Respondent has not placed before Court material evidence upon which the Court may make its own assessment and conclusions to determine whether the action it took was reasonable to do a warrantless search on the Petitioner and in the process infringed their constitutional rights. It therefore follows that the search and seizure contravened provisions of Article 31 of 
the Constitution
…”






95.
The Constitution
 recognizes the right to privacy by protecting an individual from unnecessary and unauthorized intrusion in following manner;
Article 31: Every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have-
a.
their person, home or property searched
b.
their possessions seized
c.
Information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed or
d.
the privacy of their communications infringed.






96.
The Petitioner quite correctly concedes that there can be a limitation of right to privacy if there are valid or justifiable reasons for the same. This reverberates well with the ratio in Berstein vs Bester NO (1996) (2) SA 751 cited with approval in Tom Ojienda T/A Tom Ojienda & Associates Advocates vs Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commissions and 5 Others (2016) eKLR the Lord Ackermann explained the competing nature of privacy right held follows:
“
The truism that no right is to be considered absolute, implies that from the outset of interpretation each right is always already limited by every other right accruing to another citizen. In the context of privacy, this would mean that it is only the inner sanctum of a person, such as his/her family life, sexual preference and home environment, which is shielded from erosion by conflicting rights of the community. This implies that community rights and the rights of fellow members place a corresponding obligation on a citizen, thereby shaping the abstract notion of individualism towards identifying a concrete member of a civil society. Privacy is acknowledged in the truly personal realm, but as a person moves into communal relations and activities such as business and social interaction, the scope of personal space shrinks accordingly.”






97.
However, notwithstanding the concession that the privacy rights can be limited as long as there is a clear and valid justification, in the instant case the 1
st
 Petitioner contended that the 1
st
 Respondent did not provide any valid grounds or have any factual basis for the alleged intrusion into the privacy of the Petitioners hence there was violation of Article 31 rights in respect of the 1st Petitioner.






98.
In so stating the Petitioner fails to acknowledge that the 1
st
 Respondent in its replying sworn by John Ekadah on 28
th
 June, 2019 disclosed in paragraph 7,8, 9, 10 and 11 as follows:
“


7.
That the 1
st
 Respondent received information to the effect that the 1
st
 Petitioner, an employee of the National Treasury through the 2
nd
 – 24 Petitioners, being business associated with him were suspected to be involved in fraud and/or money laundering by siphoning money from various government ministries and departments.






“8.
That the 1
st
 Respondent commenced investigations into entities and individuals who were involved in Government Supplies and had been paid by the Government through its Financial Management System.”






“9.
That the 1
st
 Respondent having received the said information commenced investigations into the tax affairs of the 1
st
 -24
th
 Petitioners for the period 2010-2017 to check their compliance status. (Attached hereto and marked ‘JE 1’ is a bundle of fact-finding letters written to various government agencies all dated 11
th
 October, 2017).”






“10.
That the preliminary findings were that the Petitioners were noon-filers for both corporation tax and VAT despite them doing business with various government ministries and departments including the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, Ministry of Sports, Culture and Youth Affairs and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, thereby earning taxable income.”






“11.
That the Petitioners hereinabove were found to have been paid a cumulative Total of 583,322,534/- and had not filed returns with respect to Income Tax, Value Added Tax, PAYE and Capital gains Tax.






“12.
That from the investigations findings, it was apparent that the Petitioners had deliberately defaulted on obligations imposed under Tax Law which is an offence under section 97 (e) as read with 104 (3) of the Tax Procedure Act.”








99.
This was what informed the actions that were initiated against the Petitioners by the 1
st
 Respondent. In elaborating what amounts to reasonable suspicion the Court in 
Emmanuel Suipanu Siyanga vs Republic Criminal Appeal No.124 of 2009
 held thus;
“
… it follows that the factual basis which would make any suspicion which is actually formed a reasonable one must also exist at the material time; a suspicion cannot be held to be reasonable if it is founded on non-existent facts. This would be a subjective suspicion and must be based upon grounds actually existing at the time of its formation. If there are not ground which then made suspicion reasonable, it was not a reasonable suspicion. Whether grounds actually existed at the time is to be tested objectively. Consequently a suspicion may be reasonable even though subjectively it was based on unreasonable grounds, to prove reasonable suspicion, it must of necessity be recognized that a reasonable suspicion never involves certainly as to the truth. Where it does, it ceases to be suspicion and becomes fact … there must be satisfactory account …”






100.
I have carefully considered the reasons given by the 1
st
 Respondent and it is my considered opinion given that the 1
st
 Respondent did not just move against the Petitioner based on intuition but its decision was backed by findings that pointed strongly to the fact that tax offences had been committed by the Petitioners, its actions against the Petitioners were proportionate and reasonably necessary and met the threshold under Article 24 on limiting the right to privacy in public interest.






101.
In regard to the violation of right to fair administrative action under Article 47, I find no basis for this claim in the light of my earlier analysis in which I noted that that opportunity to the Petitioners was accorded as the 1
st
 Respondent tried to contact the 1
st
 Petitioner severally by mobile contact, letters and even emails but was elusive and failed to take advantage of that chance to state his stance on the matter.






102.
In the final analysis, I find no merit in this Petition which I now proceed to dismiss with costs to the Respondents.

Accused










Sentence










1.
The Accused therein was convicted of Murder on 30/5/2024.






2.
In Mitigation, his Advocate told the court that the Accused is a first offender; that he is a young man and has a family to take care of. He insist that he acted in self defence. He further submits that he is remorseful and regrets his offence. He prays for leniency.






3.
The social inquiry done at the request of the court indicated that the Accused’s parents home was burnt by fellow villagers following the murder incident, it is apparent that burning of a suspects house is the local community’s way of expressing disapproval of the crime of murder and an avenue of excommunicating the offender from the community. At the time of the social inquiry the Accused’s family had gone and settled somewhere in Siaya County.






4.
The social inquiry accounts reflect divergent observation by the two communities, and therefore I have not considered these views for purposes of this ruling.






5.
However, being a first offender and remorse are mitigating factors. The circumstances of the offence as per the witnesses’ accounts show that the Accused’s actions were motivated by acts of self-preservation. He considered his business of selling illicit brews was under threats by the acts of the deceased. As pointed out by the prosecution, the business was illegal in any event. It was an act of self-centeredness and exaltation of economic survival, at the expense of human life. It is a twisted view of life which must be deterred






6.
. It is also necessary that the Accused spends a term in prison which term will afford him a time for retrospection and hopefully, a paradigm shift in his values.






7.
In view of all the aforegoing, I hereby sentence the accused to 20 years in prison. The sentence will take effect from the date of his conviction.






8.
Right of Appeal- 14 days.

Ruling










1.
I find myself unable to write judgment in this matter, as the original trial court records have not been availed. I only have the record of appeal, and I cannot vouch for its contents. The ruling, which is the subject of this appeal, dated 19
th
 July 2023, which appears at page 159 of the record of appeal, is not certified. I also do not see a certification of the typed proceedings, although there does appear a signature at page 8 of those proceedings and page 146 of the record of appeal, against the date of 1
st
 September 2023. The record of appeal also carries other materials, which are usually not subject to certification, but I have no means of telling whether they were obtained from the original trial record.






2.
The rules relating to appeals to the High Court, from the trial courts, require that the handwritten record of the trial court, together with the transcript, duly certified, be availed for appeal purposes. I do not think that there has been compliance. The appeal is, therefore, not ready for determination.






3.
Consequently, I do hereby direct that the file herein be placed before the Presiding Judge, Civil Division, High Court of Kenya, Milimani Law Courts, Nairobi, for mention, with a view to getting compliance. It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The Petitioners instituted this Petition vide a Petition dated 8
th
 August 2024. Contemporaneous to the filing of the said Petition, the Petitioners also filed a Notice of Motion dated 16
th
 August 2024 seeking interalia conservatory orders against the Respondents. The firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates filed the said pleadings on behalf of the Petitioners.






2.
Upon service of the said pleadings to the Respondents, the 1
st
 Respondent filed an application dated 16
th
 August 2024 objecting to the representation of the Petitioners by the firm of Mwazighe & Co Advocates. The application sought the following orders:
a.
….Spent.
b.
That  the law firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates be disqualified and barred from continuing to act as legal representatives in the current position, having previously entered into a binding and enforceable retainer agreement with Mbulia community dated 29
th
 March 2021.
c.
That  the law firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates be restrained, whether by itself, its partners, associates, or agents from advising, acting for, or assisting the opposing party in any manner related to this petition or any matter arising therefrom.
d.
That an order directing the law firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates to immediately cease and desist from representing or associating with the Petitioners herein or any other party opposing the interests of the Mbulia Community in any related proceedings until the final determination of this matter.
e.
That  the costs of this application be provided for by the Respondents;






3.
The application is premised on the grounds appearing on its face together with the supporting affidavit of Charles Mwaizinga sworn on 16
th
 August 2024.






4.
It was the Applicant’s case that the law firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates entered into a retainer agreement dated 29
th
 March 2021 with Mbulia Community under which the said firm committed to act in the best interests of the community without compromise or conflict in all legal and advisory matters. The said retainer agreement is still in force and has not been terminated thereby binding the firm to its obligations therein. It was averred that clause 13 of the said retainer agreement prohibited the firm from acting, advising, assisting, or representing any party that may oppose or have adverse interests to those of the Mbulia Community. The firm’s current representation of the of the Petition herein in this petition constitutes a glaring and unequivocal conflict of interest, in direct violation of the said clause.






5.
It was contended by the 1
st
 Respondent/Applicant that the law firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates, by representing the Petitioners herein, is in breach of its fiduciary duty to the Mbulia Community, having previously undertaken to notify the community in writing of any matters or issues that may prejudice their interests. The firm has failed to uphold this duty, further undermining the trust reposed in it by the Mbulia Community and that the actions of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates in representing an opposing party in a matter directly affecting the Mbulia Community erode the trust and confidence that clients place in their legal representatives and bring the legal profession into disrepute and further that the continued involvement of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates in this matter contravenes the rules of professional conduct governing advocates. The court was urged to allow the application as prayed.






6.
The application was opposed by the Petitioners vide a Replying Affidavit sworn by Mwazighe Micar Advocate on 16
th
 August 2024. It was deponed that the firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates has not received any instructions from the 1
st
 Respondent from May 2021 to date. It was contended that the 1
st
 Respondent had not demonstrated how the fact of the concluded instructions between the firm and the 1
st
 Respondent would bring a conflict of interest in the present matter which was a distinct suit and further that the Petitioners are entitled to a counsel of their choice.






7.
The application was canvassed by way of oral submissions made by Counsel for the parties on 19
th
 August 2024. Learned Counsel Mr. Mburu made oral submissions on behalf of the Applicant while Learned Counsel Mr. Wambua made oral submissions on behalf of the 2
nd
 Respondent in support of the application. Lead Counsel, Ms. Waswa appeared on behalf of the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Respondents but did not make any oral submissions in respect to the application, leaving it to the Court to decide. Learned Counsel Mr. Mwazighe made oral submissions on behalf of the Petitioners in opposition to the application.






8.
The Court having considered the application and oral submissions made by the parties is of the view that the main issue for consideration at this stage is whether the firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates should be disqualified from acting for the Petitioners.






9.
The right to legal representation is a fundamental principle of 
the Constitution
. In the case of 
William Audi Odode & Another v- John Yier & Another, Court of Appeal Civil Application No. NAI 360 of 2004
, the court held: -
“
I must state on the outset that it is not the business of the courts to tell litigants which advocate should and should not act in a particular matter. Indeed, each party to a litigation has the right to choose his or her own advocate and unless it is shown to a court of law that the interests of justice would not be served if a particular advocate were allowed to act in the matter, the parties must be allowed to choose their own counsel”.






10.
The Court of Appeal in Delphis Bank Ltd v Channan Singh Chatthe & 6 others [2005] eKLR laid out the test which must be demonstrated when considering an application for the disqualification of an advocate from representing a litigant. The Court of Appeal aptly held as follows: -
“
The starting point is, of course, to reiterate that most valued constitutional right to a litigant; the right to a legal representative or advocate of his choice. In some cases however, particularly civil, the right may be put to serious test if there is a conflict of interests which may endanger the equally hallowed principle of confidentiality in advocate/client fiduciary relationships or where the advocate would double up as a witness. There is otherwise no general rule that an advocate cannot act for one party in a matter and then act for the opposite party in subsequent litigation. The test which has been laid down in authorities applied by this Court is whether real mischief or real prejudice will in all human probability result. The authorities we allude to are King Woolen Mills Ltd & Anor vs. M/S Kaplan & Stratton [1993] LLR 2170 (CAK), (C.A 55/93) and Uhuru Highway Development Ltd & others vs Central Bank of Kenya Ltd & others (2), [2002] 2 EA 654.”






11.
Regarding conflict of interest and client confidentiality Halsbury Laws of England 4th Edition at paragraph 527, page 353 states:
“
A practicing barrister must not accept any instruction if there is or appears to be a conflict or risk of conflict either between the interests of the barrister and some other person or between the interests of any one or more clients, unless all relevant persons consent to the barrister accepting the instructions.
A barrister must also not accept instructions if there is a risk that information confidential to another client or former client might be communicated to or used for the benefit of anyone other than that client or former client without their consent.”
8.
Black’s Law Dictionary Tenth Edition defines conflict of interest as:
“1.
A           real or seeming incompatibility between one’s private interests and one’s public or fiduciary duties.
2.
A real or seeming incompatibility between the interests of two of a lawyer’s clients, such that the lawyer is disqualified from representing both clients if the dual representation adversely affects either client or if the clients do not consent”.






12.
In the same vein, The Law Society of Kenya Code of Standards of Professional Practice and Ethical Conduct, 2016 defines conflict of interest in Rule 6 paragraph 96 as follows: -
“
A conflicting interest is an interest which gives rise to substantial risk that the Advocate’s representation of the client will be materially and adversely affected by the Advocate’s own interests or by the Advocate’s duties to another current client, former client or a third person.”






13.
In the instant application, the evidence tendered herein only shows that the firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates were only engaged in April 2021 in a transaction to register the conversion of Mbulia Group Ranch to Mbulia Community Land wherein a sum of Kshs 40,000 was paid to them as fees. In May 2021, the Secretary of the 1
st
 Respondent, Mr. Gerald Kishushu informed Mr. Mwazighe Advocate that the 1
st
 Respondent had already engaged another firm to act for them in their issues and to date the firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates has never been engaged further by the 1
st
 Respondent.






14.
What the court is supposed to do is to thrust the essential core of the grounds advanced for disqualification, look at the real issues in dispute, the facts of the case and place all that on the scale of the threshold of the law applicable. In the process, courts of law must invariably eliminate any possibility that the arguments for disqualification may have subordinated important factual and legal vitalities in the transactions in question while inflating generalized individual desires to prevent a party from benefiting from a counsel.






15.
From the evidence on record, the events leading to the current petition were post May 2021 and the 1
st
 Respondent has not adduced any cogent evidence to demonstrate any mischief, conflict of interest or prejudice that may be suffered if the firm of Mwazighe & Co. Advocates continues to act for the Petitioners. Given the role of the concerned advocates and the nature of the claim herein, there is no possibility of conflict of interest arising herein as it has not been shown they have any particular personal interest which will collide with their fiduciary duties as advocates.






16.
In view of the foregoing, it is the finding of this Court that the 1
st
 Respondent/Applicant’s application dated 16

Appellant




and




Jubilee General Insurance Limited


 


Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from the judgment of Hon. C. Ndumia, Senior Resident Magistrate, SRM, delivered on 8th July 2022, in Nairobi SCCC No. 1199 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the appellant, against the respondent, for a sum of Kshs. 904,000.00, or, in the alternative, a sum of Kshs. 189,580.85 being an amount due to it. The case by the appellant was that it loaned some money to a person who had insured his motor-vehicle, registration mark and number KCC 583A, with the respondent, with that motor-vehicle as security, on the understanding that the appellant would be entitled to full benefit of the insurance contract in the event of loss or damage to the motor-vehicle. It was further the case that the respondent had, by endorsement, undertaken to pay any claim payable under the insurance contract to the appellant. The risk insured against attached, on 23
rd
 December 2020, when the insured motor-vehicle was involved in an accident, and was declared a total loss, whereupon the respondent resolved to settle the claim at Kshs. 904,000.00, causing the appellant to execute the relevant documents, but the respondent thereafter declined to pay.






2.
The respondent filed a defence, in which it denied liability, on the basis that it was wrongly sued, for it had settled its obligation under the insurance contract, by paying to the insured person under the insurance contract what was due to him. It further averred that it was not privy to whatever agreement there might have been between the appellant and the insured person.






3.
A formal hearing was conducted, on 7
th
 June 2022, when 1 witness each testified for the appellant and the respondent. Judgment was delivered on 8
th
 July 2022, in favour of the respondent. The claim by the appellant was dismissed.






4.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 3
rd
 August 2022, turn on the trial court erring in finding that the appellant was not privy to the insurance contract; failing to find that there was no new contract between the insured and the respondent, given that the contract was renewed automatically; failing to find that the insurance contract terms had not changed; failing to consider the endorsement of the rights or interests of the appellant in the insurance contract; failing to consider the proprietary interest or right by the appellant in the insured motor-vehicle; failing to consider the essence of the discharge voucher that the appellant had executed; and failing to consider the evidence that the appellant had tendered at the trial.






5.
Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were given on 26
th
 September 2023, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. Both sides have filed written submissions.






6.
The appellant identified 2 issues for determination. The first being whether there was privity of contract, and the second being whether the appellant had a proprietary interest in the insured motor-vehicle. On the first issue, the appellant relies on an endorsement, by the insured on the insurance policy, or contract, in favour of the appellant, and a letter of endorsement, executed by the respondent on 22
nd
 May 2020. It is submitted that upon expiry of the original policy or insurance, the same was automatically renewed under the same terms. On the second issue, it is averred that the vehicle was jointly registered in the names of the appellant and the insured. The decision in Mark Otanga Otiende vs. Dennis Oduor Aduol [2021] eKLR (Aburili, J), is cited, on the will of the parties to a contract being respected.






7.
On his part, the respondent argues on only 1 issue, privity of contract, on the basis that the appellant had no insurable interest in the insured motor-vehicle, and that a contract could only be enforced by the persons party to it. Anetol vs. Manufacture Life Insurance Company Limited [1899] AC 604 and Kenya National Oil Corporation Limited vs. Albert Mairo Cordeiro & another [2014] eKLR (Visram, Maraga & Okwengu, JJA) are relied on. It is submitted that privity of contract was not proved. Secondly, it is submitted that the initial contract of insurance expired, and the insured renewed the contract without involving the appellant. It is submitted that the endorsement, of 22
nd
 May 2022, was not transposed into the new contract, and to argue otherwise, would be to re-write the contract between the parties, contrary to the pronouncement by the court in Hussamudin Gulamhussein Pothiwalla administrator, Trustee and Executor of the Estate of Gulamhussein Ebrahim Pothiwalla vs. Kidogo Basi Housing Cooperative Society Limited & 31 others (Tunoi, O’Kubasu & Githinji, JJA). Fredrick Kariuki Munene & another vs. Joseph Musyoka Nzavu [2022] eKLR (Limo, J) is cited, to make the point that an insurance policy is not transferrable to a purchaser of a motor-vehicle, even if sold when the cover existed, whether the cover was comprehensive or third party.






8.
There is really only 1 issue for determination, whether the appellant was privy to the contract of insurance between the respondent and the insured.






9.
There is no dispute that the interest by the appellant in the insured motor-vehicle was endorsed in the insurance contract running between 7
th
 December 2019 and 6
th
 December 2020. That made the appellant privy to that contract. After that policy or contract expired, there was a renewal. The new insurance contract or policy was to cover the period 7
th
 December 2020 and 6
th
 December 2021. The witness, presented by the appellant, at the trial, conceded that the appellant was not party to the renewal, but argued that such renewal of contract was automatic. He did not cite any provision in the policy to that effect. The witness, presented by the respondent, testified that the new contract did not involve the appellant, the insured did not disclose the interest of the appellant at the renewal, and the interest of the appellant was not endorsed. To the extent that the appellant was not party to the renewal, and its interest in the renewed policy was not noted or endorsed in that contract, meant that the appellant was not privy to that contract. The accident of 23
rd
 December 2020 happened when the appellant was not privy to the policy, and it was not entitled under it.






10.
The appellant argued that the respondent sent to it a discharge voucher for Kshs. 904,000.00, which it filled and returned, but the same was never paid. I have not been able to find a copy of the said discharge voucher amongst the documents that the appellant was relying on. However, whether the respondent sent to the appellant such a document, and the appellant executed it, would not change the fact that the appellant was not privy to the contract to provide cover with respect to the insured vehicle, as at the date of the accident on 23
rd
 December 2020. The appellant further argued that the motor-vehicle was registered jointly between it and the insured, yet it did not place before the trial court evidence that as at 23
rd
 December 2020, it jointly owned the motor-vehicle with the insured. In any case, in a policy of insurance taken out by one owner, without inclusion of the name of the other owner, would still mean that that other owner would not be privy to the contract, and cannot enforce it against the insurer.






11.
Overall, I find no merit in the appeal herein, and I hereby dismiss it, with costs. It is so ordered.

          (Appeal from judgment and decree of Hon. SG Gitonga, Resident Magistrate, RM, in Milimani CMCCC No. 3496 of 2017, delivered on 4th June 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellants had sued the respondent, at the primary court, for compensation, with respect to the death of Peter Mwangi Kuria, to be referred hereafter as the deceased, following a road traffic accident on 20
th
 June 2014, along Heshima Road. The deceased was a pedestrian on the said road, and was knocked down by motor vehicle registration mark and number KAP 577T, said to have belonged to the respondent, and liability was attributed to him on account of negligence. The respondent filed a defence, denying everything pleaded in the plaint, and, in the alternative, pleaded contribution on the part of the deceased.






2.
A trial was conducted. Liability was settled by consent, on 28
th
 November 2019, at 85:15, in favour of the appellants and against the respondent. 1 witness testified for the appellants, on the aspect of quantum. Judgment was delivered on 4
th
 June 2021. The court awarded Kshs. 50,000.00 for pain and suffering and Kshs. 100,000.00 for loss of expectation of life; and Kshs. 391,200.00 for loss of dependency; all totalling Kshs. 541,200.00, subject, of course, to contribution.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The appeal has raised several grounds revolving around quantum.






4.
On 18
th
 March 2024, directions were given, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. From the record before me, I can only see written submissions by the appellants.






5.
The appellants have argued on the multiplier and the multiplicand. On the multiplier used of 5, for someone aged 49 years, they submit that the same was on the lower side, and argue that, at the very least, a multiplier of 7 should have been considered, although they pitch for 15. They take issue with the trial court using 60 years as the retirement age, given that that was practical only for individuals in formal employment, and arguing that individuals outside formal employment can continue working gainfully up to 70 years and beyond. They cite Millicent Teresa Anyango vs. Patrick Gombe [2003] eKLR (Mbito, J), Tessie Margaret Kariuki & another vs. Shakalaga Khwa Jirongo & another [2014] eKLR (Waweru, J) and Chania Shuttle vs. Mary Mumbi [2017] eKLR (J. Kamau, J), where a point had been made that there was no retirement age for a businessman. On the multiplicand, they contest the figure used by the trial court, of Kshs. 9,780.00, asserting that the evidence they adduced indicated that the deceased earned Kshs. 30,000.00, per month, from his hustles as a mason.






6.
The multiplier is about the length of time that the deceased would have continued working had he not died at the accident. What would be considered would be the actual age of the deceased, against the average mortality rate in the country and the age of retirement, for the sort of engagement the deceased was in. The so-called vagaries and vicissitudes of life are then brought to bear on these. The retirement age in Kenya is 60 years. The average mortality rate varies from time to time. The court works out the multiplier from a consideration of these factors. There is no scientific way of working out the multiplier, and the courts rely on past decisions as a guide.






7.
I appreciate, the authorities cited with respect to not comparing engaging in business with employment. However, the issue is not employment as such, but the capacity of an individual to work. After all, employment is not restricted to formal employment. Engaging in business or related personal pursuits is still considered to be a form of gainful employment. The general presumption would be that a majority of individuals scale down on working, whether as formal employees or in personal/private pursuits, from around age 60. Some may go on working beyond 60 and 70 even. However, those would be exceptions. It is about aging, loss of the strength and capacity to engage gainfully in employment or otherwise to earn an income. The figure 60 is an average. It has worked well over the years, and I am not persuaded that there would be good reason to depart from it in this case. At least, no good reason has been presented for that in this case.






8.
Let me now advert to past decisions to get guidance. I will start with the decisions relied on by the appellants. In Millicent Teresa Anyango vs. Patrick Gombe [2003] eKLR (Mbito, J), the court applied a multiplier of 14 for a 41-year-old deceased person. 15 was adopted as the multiplier, where the deceased died at 45 years, in Tessie Margaret Kariuki & another vs. Shakalaga Khwa Jirongo & another [2014] eKLR (Waweru, J). I have looked up other cases. In Mutuku Mbithi vs. Coast Bus Safaris Limited & another [2012] eKLR (Waweru, J), the court adopted 5 years for a 57-year-old. 11 years was adopted, in Joyce Mumbi Mugi vs. Cooperative Bank of Kenya Limited & 2 others  [2004] eKLR (Maina, J), for a 51 year-old.






9.
The survey above reveals a pattern which suggests that the multiplier adopted by the trial court was within the range. A multiplier of 5 would appear appropriate for a person dying in his 50s and above. A multiplier in the region of 15 would be sufficient for a person aged 40 and below; while an average of 10 would be adequate for individuals in their 40s. The age of the deceased was not altogether certain. It was pleaded in the plaint that he was 49, while PW1, his widow, the 1
st
 appellant herein, testified, on 28
th
 November 2019, that he died at 53 years old. A certificate of birth, or any other document for that matter, was not produced as proof of his age. In view of that I am not persuaded that the multiplier adopted was particularly off the range. I note too that in the plaint, the appellants did not list the alleged dependants of the deceased, even though they pleaded that he had a family. A letter from the Chief was produced at the trial, but that came too late, and amounted to trial by ambush.






10.
On the multiplicand, the objection was with use of the formal employment to work out the same. The appellants are particularly unhappy with the figure of Kshs. 9,780.00, and wonder where the trial court got it from, considering that they had led evidence on a monthly income of Kshs. 30,000.00. It is a practice that has gained traction, that where there is inadequate proof of income, the court resorts to the Government regulation of wages subsidiary legislation, for guidance. In Nyamira Tea Farmers Sacco vs. Wilfred Nyambati Kiraita [2011] eKLR (Asike-Makhandia, J), the appellate court held that the trial court was justified in using the Regulation of Wages document to work out the multiplicand, where evidence on income was insufficient.






11.
Did the appellants adduce adequate evidence on the income that the deceased was making prior to his death, from his endeavours? When the 1
st
 appellant testified, on 28
th
 November 2019, she stated that the deceased earned Kshs. 30,000.00 from his work as a mason. She produced no documents which supported that, or, at the very least, that demonstrated that he was a mason. In the absence of such evidence, the trial court was justified to revert to the Regulation of Wages.






12.
In their written submissions, the appellants vaguely suggest that a global award approach would have done more justice to the matter, and it was in that context that they cite Daniel Mwangi Kimemia & 2 others vs. JGM & another (the personal representatives of the estate of NK (DCD) [2016] eKLR (Gikonyo, J). Whether to use the multiplier/multiplicand approach or the global/lumpsum award approach is a matter at the discretion of the trial court. I am not persuaded that the trial court went wrong in adopting the multiplier/multiplicand approach. After all, at the trial, the appellants presented their case, going by the written submissions that they filed there, on the basis of the multiplier/multiplicand approach, and they only shifted gears after judgment was delivered, apparently after they failed to get what they expected.






13.
In the end, I find no merit in the appeal, and I hereby disallow it. The effect shall be that the appeal herein is hereby dismissed. Each party shall bear their own costs.

Ruling










1.
The record of appeal filed herein is incomplete. It covers proceedings that were conducted between 2
nd
 July 2009 and 7
th
 September 2021, and then the judgment that was delivered on 3
rd
 June 2022. In the proceedings, conducted between 2
nd
 July 2009 and 7
th
 September 2021, 3 witnesses testified, all for the respondent, and none testified for the appellant, being PW1, PW2 and PW3. The handwritten notes of the trial court indicate that further proceedings were conducted after 7
th
 September 2021, before judgment was delivered. Those proceedings ran from 19
th
 January 2022 to 21
st
 February 2022, during which 1 witness testified for the respondent and 1 for the appellant, being PW4 and DW1, after which written submissions were filed, and judgment delivered. The proceedings between 19
th
 January 2022 to 21
st
 February 2022 were not typed, and are not in the record of appeal that was filed herein.






2.
The proceedings between 19
th
 January 2022 to 21
st
 February 2022 were conducted by Hon. Mburu, SPM, after he took over conduct of the matter from Hon. DO Mbeja, Senior Resident Magistrate, SRM, who had handled it previously, and had taken evidence from the 3 witnesses who testified before Hon. Mburu, SPM, took over. The judgment appealed against was by Hon. Mburu, SPM, after he took over, and heard part of the case, when he handled 2 witnesses, including the 1 from the defence.






3.
The record of appeal must be aligned to the original trial court record. It must be a true reflection of what the trial court recorded, given that the judgment appealed against is based on that trial record. An incomplete record could mislead the appellate court to make determinations which are half-baked, on account of the gaps in the record of appeal.






4.
Sitting as an appellate court, I could still resolve the appeal based on the original trial court notes, by ignoring the incomplete record of appeal. The risk with that, however, would be that either of the parties could be aggrieved with my verdict, as an appellate court, and may wish to escalate the dispute to the Court of Appeal, which does not usually act on original trial court records, but on records of appeal filed by the parties. It would be most likely that the incomplete record of appeal filed herein, of the proceedings at the trial court, could be filed at the Court of Appeal, denying it a chance to have access to the true record of what transpired at trial, presenting a real chance of miscarriage of justice.






5.
In view of the above, I will refrain from writing judgment in this matter. I shall, instead, require that the appellant files a complete record of appeal, incorporating a certified typescript of the proceedings that the trial court conducted between 19
th
 January 2022 to 21
st
 February 2022, when the last 2 witnesses testified. This file shall be placed before the Presiding Judge, Civil Division, High Court of Kenya, at Milimani, Nairobi, for further directions. It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the appellant, against the respondents, for compensation, for malicious prosecution, with respect to a criminal prosecution in Busia CMCCRC No. 781 of 2017, on charges of forgery, fraud, obtaining money by false pretences and possession of public stores, all of which terminated with his acquittal. The case by the appellant was that the charges were founded on a false and malicious report, and poor investigations.






2.
The 1
st
 respondent filed a defence, in which he denied liability, arguing that he made a report to the police, which was genuine and justified, and the same was investigated and charges preferred. He averred that the decision to prefer charges entirely rested with the police, and not him, and that the suit was orchestrated by the appellant in a bid to intimidate him from pursuing justice. The 2
nd
 respondent, in its defence, averred that a complaint was filed with the police, it was investigated, a probable and reasonable suspicion was drawn, that the appellant had committed an offence, the police exercised their statutory duties in arresting him and arraigning him in court, and that his subsequent prosecution was without any malice.






3.
A formal hearing was conducted, where only the appellant testified. The respondents called 2 witnesses. In the end, a judgment was delivered on 22
nd
 November 2022, where the suit was dismissed, on grounds that the case was not proved on a balance of probability.






4.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 15
th
 December 2022, revolve around the trial court delivering a judgment that was against the weight of the evidence tendered; failing to find that the appellant had proved his case to the required standard; extraneous matters were considered; and pertinent issues were not considered.






5.
Directions were given on 26
th
 February 2024, for disposal of the appeal by way of written submissions. There has been no compliance, for neither of the parties filed written submissions.






6.
The case before the trial court was founded on the tort of malicious prosecution. Case law, as stated in Egbema vs. West Nile District Administration [1972] EA 60 (Sir William Duffus P, Law Ag. VP & Lutta JA), Kagane and others vs. Attorney-General and another [1969] EA 643 (Rudd, J), Katerregga vs. Attorney General [1973) EA 287 (Mead, J), Murunga vs. Republic [1976-80] 1 KLR 1251 (Cotran, J), among others, is to the effect that the ingredients for the tort of malicious prosecution, and which any claimant for damages or compensation for that tort must prove, are: the prosecution was initiated by the defendant or defendants, it terminated in favour of the plaintiff, it was initiated without reasonable and probable cause, and it was instituted with malice.






7.
In Kagane and others vs. Attorney-General and another [1969] EA 643 (Rudd, J) and Murunga vs. Republic [1976-80] 1 KLR 1251 (Cotran. J) the court defined about what constitutes reasonable and probable cause. It was said that it is about the guilt of the accused person being based on reasonable grounds, and that there would be absence of reasonable and probable cause where a reasonable and cautious person would not have been satisfied that there was a proper case to be put before the criminal court. The person alleging malicious prosecution, must place evidence or facts before the civil court, to demonstrate that the case that the defendants had placed before the criminal court did not have any reasonable or probable cause, and that it was on that account that the prosecution failed. An acquittal by itself is not adequate proof of lack of a reasonable and probable cause. The plaintiff must go beyond the acquittal, and present material designed to explain why the prosecution terminated with his acquittal. The mere fact that the prosecution failed, without more, will not do.






8.
The foundation for the tort of malicious prosecution is malice. There ought to be evidence to demonstrate that the prosecution was not about pursuit of justice, but was designed to achieve some wrongful or improper intent or motive. The standard meaning of malice is spite, invective, ill-will, wrongful motive, wickedness, among others. It refers to an intent to commit a wrongful act, or to act with reckless disregard of the law or the legal rights of another. Malicious prosecution is the institution of proceedings against a person for an improper purpose, or from wrongful and improper motives. See Black’s Law Dictionary, Tenth Edition, Thomas Reuters, 2009, 1101, and 1102; Nzoia Sugar Company Limited vs. Fungututi [1988] KLR 399 (Platt, Apaloo JJA & Masime Ag JA); Gitau vs. Attorney General [1990] KLR 13 (Trainor, J);  Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd vs. Intercom Services Ltd & 4 others [2004] eKLR (Gicheru CJ, Githinji & Onyango-Otieno JJA) and Peter Kituku Ngilu vs. Attorney General [2021] eKLR (Riechi, J).






9.
So, what happened here? Did the appellant demonstrate that his prosecution was not for probable cause, and was actuated by malice? I have perused both the plaint, the witness statement and the oral testimony in court, and I have noted that the appellant made no effort to demonstrate that the criminal prosecution was malicious, in terms of it being driven by spite or ill-will, or some other wrongful or improper motive, or that it was designed to serve some improper or wrongful purpose, and that the criminal prosecution did not have any probable or reasonable cause. He merely presented evidence of a criminal prosecution that terminated in his favour, and because the prosecution witnesses did not testify. He did not lead any evidence of the circumstances of the case which could have exhibited malice in the action taken by the respondents. He needed to do more than just prove that he had been arrested, charged and acquitted.






10.
The burden of proof of malice and of lack of probable and reasonable cause, in cases of this nature, lies with the plaintiff, and shifts to the defendants only after the plaintiff has presented evidence of malice and of lack of probable or reasonable cause, for the defendants to explain themselves. See Karugi & another vs. Kabiya & 3 others [1983] eKLR (Hancox JA, Chesoni & Platt Ag JJA) and Gichinga Kibutha vs. Caroline Nduku [2018] eKLR (JG Kemei, J). The trial court was not in error. From the facts of this case, the appellant did not discharge that burden, and did not establish any case against the respondents to warrant any orders being made in his favour. The trial court came to the right conclusion, for the appellant had failed to establish his case to the required standard.






11.
In the end, I find that the appeal herein is not merited, and I hereby disallow it. The consequence is that the appeal is dismissed in its entirety. Each party shall bear its own costs. It is so ordered.

Between




John Mukisa


 


Appellant




and




West Kenya Sugar Company Limited


 


Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from the judgment and decree of Hon. Kassim Akida, Resident Magistrate, CM, Adjudicator, delivered on 15th February 2024, in Busia SCCC No. E033 of 2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the appellant, against the respondent, for compensation, arising from a road traffic accident, which allegedly happened on 18
h
 July 2023, along the Busiwabo-Mundika road, involving the appellant and a motor-tractor registration mark and number KTCB 789H/ZG1867. KTCB 789H/ZG1867 was allegedly owned or controlled by the respondent at the material time, and the appellant was travelling on it as a passenger, when the same was allegedly recklessly and carelessly driven. The respondent was allegedly injured in the accident, and he attributed it to negligence on the part of the respondent. The respondent filed a response, in which it denied everything pleaded in the statement of claim, specifically pleading that the said motor-tractor was not within Busia County at the material time, but at Kakamega.






2.
A formal hearing was conducted, on 16
th
 January 2024, where 4 witnesses testified for the appellant, and 1 for the respondent. Judgment was delivered on 15
th
 February 2024. The claim was dismissed, on the basis that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it.






3.
The appellants were aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 20
th
 February 2024, revolve around the trial court considering issues that were not pleaded nor canvassed before it; there being no evidence that the cause of action was in the nature of an employer/employee relationship; the provisions of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, Cap 10A, Laws of Kenya, being disregarded; the failure to determine the issues of liability and quantum, regardless of jurisdiction; and the claim being dismissed instead of being struck out.






4.
Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were not given, but both sides have filed written submissions.






5.
The appellant has submitted on jurisdiction, the dismissal of the claim instead of striking it out, and the failure to make a determination on quantum and liability. On jurisdiction, it is submitted that the claim was not subject to the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, Cap 236, Laws of Kenya, contrary to what the trial court held, as a contract of employment was not established between the appellant and the respondent, for the evidence before the court was that the appellant was an employee of the Busia Sugar Company. He relies on Isaac Lumumba Omega vs. Specialised Air Conditioning Limited [2022] eKLR (Mwaure, J). On dismissal of the claim, it is submitted that, once a court finds that it is bereft of jurisdiction, it ought to strike out the matter, instead of dismissing it. It is argued that a dismissal is final, while a striking out affords opportunity to the parties to move to the proper forum. Enock Kirao Muhanji vs. Hamid Abdala Mbarak [2013] eKLR (Angote, J) and Biosystems Consultants vs. Nyali Links Arcade [2023] eKLR (Magare, J) are cited. On liability and quantum, it is submitted that the court, despite finding itself without jurisdiction, should have addressed itself to how it would have ruled on liability and quantum, had it found that it had jurisdiction. He cites Joseph Muthuri vs. Nicholas Kinoti Kibera [2022] eKLR (PJ Otieno, J). He also cites Samwel Ngure Gathii vs. Josephine Wanjiru Mbugua [1998] eKLR (Omolo, Shah & Pall, JJA) on causation and blameworthiness. He asserts that the trial court had jurisdiction. He argues that the jurisdiction issue was not raised by the respondent at the trial.






6.
On its part, the respondent submits on 3 items, jurisdiction, ownership of the accident vehicle and blameworthiness. On jurisdiction, the respondent supports the decision of the trial court, and cites Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J). On ownership of the motor-tractor, the respondent points at a number of issues surrounding ownership of the said vehicle, and submits that ownership of the accident vehicle was not established sufficiently for liability to attach on it. It cites Nancy Ayiemba Ngaira vs. Abdi Ali [2010] eKLR (Ojwang, J), to support its contentions. It also submits that it had proved that the said vehicle was not at Busia, at the material time, but at Kabras, Kakamega. On blameworthiness, it is submitted that the appellant was blaming the driver of the subject tractor, for the accident, yet he did not join him to the suit as a co-respondent.






7.
The primary issue for determination is jurisdiction of the trial court, the rest of the issues are secondary.






8.
It is trite, that jurisdiction is at the core of any litigation. See Adero Adero & another vs. Ulinzi Sacco Limited [2002] eKLR (Ringera, J) and Joseph Njuguna Mwaura & 2 others vs. Republic [2013] eKLR (Mwera, Warsame, Kiage, Gatembu & J. Mohammed, JJA). A court or tribunal can only entertain matters that fall within its jurisdiction, which is conferred by the law, that is 
the Constitution
 and statute. See In the Matter of Interim Independent Electoral Commission [2011] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Baraza DCJ, Tunoi, Ibrahim, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ) and Kibos Distillers Limited vs. Benson Ambuti Adega & 3 others [2020] eKLR (Makhandia, Kiage & Odek, JJA). It cannot be conferred by judicial craft, in terms of the court arrogating to itself jurisdiction, where 
the Constitution
 and the statute have not so vested it, or by consent of the parties. See Samuel Kamau Macharia & another vs. Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 2 others [2012] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Tunoi, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ) and Equity Bank Limited vs. Bruce Mutie Mutuku t/a Diani Tour Travel [2016] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA). Where a court finds itself bereft of jurisdiction, over a matter that it is seized of, it should down its tools, for it ought not take any further step in the matter, for the very reason of lack of jurisdiction. See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA).






9.
One other thing, as jurisdiction goes to the core or heart, or is at the centre, of the matter, issues around it can be raised and determined at any stage of the proceedings, and in any manner. See Kenya Ports Authority vs. Modern Holdings (EA) Limited [2017] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA). It can be raised in the pleadings, or during trial, or by way of preliminary objection on a point of law, or through an application, whether orally or in writing. It can be raised by either party or by the court on its own motion. The court can address it in its judgment, at the tail-end of the trial, like in this case, regardless of whether any of the parties had raised it, whether in their pleadings or in the course of the trial. It does not have to be raised as, or made, an issue at the trial, for the court to consider it. It is so central to the validity, authenticity and competence of the proceedings that the court can entertain and determine it at any stage of the proceedings. Because of its centrality, it can be prioritised, and disposed of as a preliminary issue, after stopping the proceedings temporarily to address it. See Owners and Masters of the Motor Vessel “Joev” vs. Owners and Masters of the Motor Tugs “Barbara” and “Steve B” [2008] 1 EA 367. Where it is established that the trial court is bereft of jurisdiction, the proceedings ought to be halted, regardless of the stage at which they are at. See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA).






10.
The issue is about jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, where the claim at the trial court was initiated. The statute which vests the Small Claims Court with jurisdiction is the 
Small Claims Court Act
. That vesting is through section 12 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, which confers jurisdiction on that court to determine civil claims relating to contracts for sale and supply of goods and services, contracts to money had and received, liability in tort in respect of loss or damage caused to any property or for delivery or recovery of moveable property, compensation for personal injuries, and set off and counterclaim under any contract. The claim by the appellant was for compensation, on account of injuries sustained, allegedly in a road traffic accident. The alleged injuries were to the body or person of the appellant, and, therefore, fell within the rubric of personal injury. That suggested that that was a claim that could be properly brought under the Small Claims Act.






11.
The trial court took evidence, and it would appear that, while preparing judgment, it formed an opinion, from the material presented, that, although the claim was based on personal injury, and appeared to be within the mandate of the Small Claims Court, there was an issue of concurrent jurisdiction, as between the jurisdiction conferred by the 
Small Claims Court Act
 on the Small Claims Court, and that conferred by the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
 on the Director. The trial court took the view that the injury was suffered in the context of employment, and, going by that, formed the opinion that the claim ought to have been brought within the structures established under the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
. The pronouncement, that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the claim placed before it, was made against that background.






12.
The issue then, according to me, is whether, where a concurrence of jurisdiction, of the nature that presented itself here, arises, either the court or tribunal seized of the matter loses jurisdiction over it, or the parties would have to make a choice of the forum before which they would prefer to place their claim.






13.
The trial court flagged section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, which addresses the case where personal injury is suffered in the context of work or employment, and declares or decrees that no action should lie, whether by the injured employee or his dependant, for recovery of damages against the employer, and no liability for compensation, on the part of the employer, should arise, save or except under the provisions of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, with respect to such personal injuries.






14.
My reading of section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 and section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, together, tells me that the 2 provisions both cover personal injury. Section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 confers jurisdiction on the Small Claims Court over such personal injury, without any limitations, with respect to the circumstances under which the injury was caused. Section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
 creates limitations or restrictions, with respect to personal injury occasioned at work or in the context of employment. For such personal injury, there is no room to bring claims against the employer, ostensibly responsible, except within the structures set out in the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, and liability, for compensation for such personal injury, should be determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
. The trial court read the 2 sets of provisions together, and understood them to mean that section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
 limited the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, with respect to personal injuries suffered in a work environment, and concluded that where such limitation applied, the Small Claims Court would have no jurisdiction. It should be noteworthy, that the jurisdiction conferred on the Small Claims Court, by section 12(1) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, is subject to “any other law,” which should include section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
.






15.
For avoidance of doubt, section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
 is worded as follows:
“
Substitution of compensation for other legal remedies
No action shall lie by an employee or any dependant of an employee for the recovery of damages in respect of any occupational accident or disease resulting in the disablement or death of such employee against such employee’s employer, and no liability for compensation on the part of such employer shall arise save under the provisions of this Act in respect of such disablement or death.”






16.
While section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 says:
“
Nature of claims and pecuniary jurisdiction


(1)
Subject to this Act, the Rules and any other law, the Court has jurisdiction to determine any civil claim relating to—
(a)
…
(b)
…
(c)
…
(d)
compensation for personal injuries; and
(e)
…




(2)
…”






17.
Did the trial court properly navigate that jurisdiction issue, by way of construction of the provisions of the 2 statutes? Unfortunately, both sides to this dispute did not address me, in their written submissions, on the issues that the trial court was grappling with, with regard to jurisdiction. They contented themselves with making generalised submissions on jurisdiction. My attention has been drawn to a recent decision, in Naomi Wanjiru Irungu vs. Francis Kimani Karanja Thika HCCA No. E037 of 2024 (Muchemi, J)(unreported), where the court made a construction of section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, to the effect that the same did not include or exclude specific classes of personal injuries, neither did it classify or categorise personal injuries. However, Naomi Wanjiru Irungu vs. Francis Kimani Karanja Thika HCCA No. E037 of 2024 (Muchemi, J)(unreported) is not helpful, for the purposes or in the circumstances of the instant case, for what was placed before the court, in that case, had nothing to do with section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, and the court did not have to deal with how that provision relates with section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
.






18.
I am persuaded that the trial court properly construed and applied the 2 sets of provisions. Section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 is not to be read in isolation. It has to be interpreted in the context of other laws, including section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
. When the 2 provisions are read together, the effect would be that section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
 limits the reach of section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, by excluding its jurisdiction from matters relating to personal injury incurred at the workplace or within the context of employment.






19.
Was the injury herein incurred within the workplace, or in the context or course of employment? The trial court was persuaded that it was, that the appellant and 2 others were embarking onto the accident tractor in the course of their employment, within or near the premises of their employer. The appellant testified as PW1, and he informed the court that he boarded the tractor as an employee. The witness presented by the respondent, DW1, did not dispute that the appellant was an employee of the respondent, for he limited himself, in his testimony, to the fact that the tractor could not have been at the scene at the material time, for it was at Kabras, Kakamega.






20.
Was the appellant an employee of the respondent? In the written submissions, filed on his behalf, the respondent seeks to contest that, and cites the 
Employment Act
, Cap 226, Laws of Kenya, to support that contention. The respondent has been ambivalent on the employment status of the appellant. I find the submission, that the respondent had not provided proof of employment of the appellant, mischievous. It is not the respondent who raised the issue of employment. Indeed, as indicated herebefore, the respondent has not addressed itself to that. It was the appellant himself who brought it up, at the trial, for it never arose in the pleadings. Apparently, it was what he told the trial court that prompted it to look at section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
. He testified, on oath, before the court, as indicated above, that he boarded the tractor as an employee. It would be disingenuous of him, on appeal, to turnaround, and claim that he was not employed by the respondent, or that he was not boarding the tractor in the course of discharge of his duties as an employee. Taking an alternative stance on appeal, to that taken at the trial, would mean that he lied to the trial court, and that he is speaking from both sides of his mouth, and possibly committing perjury. His stance, on appeal, should be taken with a pinch of salt. Parties should be careful about jumping from one argument to another, to suit themselves, depending on the forum before which they are at, for, by doing so, they run the risk of perjuring themselves.






21.
The respondent has waved the decision in Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J), arguing that, going by that decision, the Small Claims Court has not jurisdiction over a claim for personal injury arising from a road traffic accident. The trial court did not excuse itself from the matter on the basis of Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J), or on the issues addressed there, relating to negligence and liability, but rather on section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, which the court in Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J) did not deal with. Secondly, the position taken in Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J) has not received universal acceptance. It arose in Naomi Wanjiru Irungu vs. Francis Kimani Karanja Thika HCCA No. E037 of 2024 (Muchemi, J)(unreported), and the court there disagreed with it, on the basis that there was nothing in section 12(1)(d) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, which included or excluded specific classes of personal injuries, in the manner suggested in Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J). I also had occasion to deal with it, in Elron Limited vs. Robert Ngui Basil Milimani HCCA No. E890 of 2022 (unreported), where I expressed a view similar to that in Naomi Wanjiru Irungu vs. Francis Kimani Karanja Thika HCCA No. E037 of 2024 (Muchemi, J)(unreported). Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J) is a decision of a court exercising concurrent jurisdiction to mine. Consequently, it does not bind me, for it is of mere persuasive authority, and, clearly, I am not persuaded by it. The trial court properly cited lack of jurisdiction, by dint of section 16 of the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, and I do not think that Ogwari vs. Hersi [2023] KEHC 20111 (KLR) (Magare, J) would have been a good reason for it to down its tools.






22.
So much for jurisdiction. The next issue relates to the consequential order that the trial court made, subsequent to its finding and holding that it had no jurisdiction, that is to say the dismissal of the claim at the trial court. The appellant argues that the trial court should not have dismissed the case, for that would have barred it from initiating another claim, before the forum with jurisdiction, and that it should have struck it out instead. The answer, to that argument, should lie with the decision in Enock Kirao Muhanji vs. Hamid Abdala Mbarak [2013] eKLR (Angote, J), which was cited by the appellant. It would not matter either way, whether a suit or claim is struck out or dismissed, on account of lack of jurisdiction, for it would not have been determined on its merits, and there would be no bar, on grounds of res judicata, to the filing of a claim or suit before the court or forum with jurisdiction. However, going by Equity Bank Limited vs. Bruce Mutie Mutuku t/a Diani Tour Travel [2016] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA) and Phoenix of EA Assurance Company Limited vs. SM Thiga t/a Newspaper Service [2019] eKLR (Karanja, Gatembu & Sichale, JJA), in such situations, the preferable position should be to strike out the cause.






23.
The appellant faulted the trial court, for not proceeding, after finding and holding that it had no jurisdiction, to indicate how it would have ruled on the matter, with respect to liability. With respect, the appellant is mixed up, as between what happens when a trial court makes a finding that there was no liability, where it is required to go on and give an indication of how it would have assessed liability, and the case where the trial court holds that it is bereft of jurisdiction. Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA) gave the way forward. It stated that the court ought to down its tools. It ought to stop and proceed no further, other than making the consequential order of either dismissing or striking out the suit or claim, for lack of jurisdiction.






24.
Let me recite verbatim, what was said in Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA), as it answers the argument that the trial court should have gone on to pronounce itself on liability and damages, after it had declared that it had no jurisdiction:
“
Jurisdiction is everything. Without it a court has no power to make one more step. Where a court has no jurisdiction, there would be no basis for a continuation of the proceedings pending other evidence. A court of law downs its tools in respect of the matter before it the moment it holds the opinion that it is without jurisdiction … Where a court takes it upon itself to exercise jurisdiction, which it does not possess, its decision amounts to nothing. Jurisdiction must be acquired before judgement is given.”






25.
The respondent made submissions on issues around ownership of the tractor and blameworthiness. These go to the merits of the matter, which the trial court did not, quite properly, go into, after it pronounced that it had no jurisdiction. The appeal herein is not on the merits of the matter that was before the trial court, but on its verdict that it had no jurisdiction. There should be no basis, therefore, for venturing into the merits of the matter. In any event, these are the matters that Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA) addresses, that once the court holds it has no jurisdiction, everything comes to a stop. See also Phoenix of EA Assurance Company Limited vs. SM Thiga t/a Newspaper Service [2019] eKLR (Karanja, Gatembu & Sichale, JJA).






26.
In view of everything said above, it is my conclusion that there is no merit in the appeal herein, the same is for dismissal, and I hereby dismiss it. I shall award costs to the respondent.

Ruling










1.
The Applicant has premised his application under the provisions of Articles 27, 50(2)(p)(q) and 165(6) of 
the Constitution
 2010; and is seeking a re-hearing of his death sentence on the grounds that it is indeterminate and inhumane and not in line with the decision rendered by the Court of Appeal in Mombasa Petiti
on No.97 of 2021
.






2.
The Applicant was charged and convicted for the offence of Robbery with Violence Contrary to Section 296(2) of the Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 2032 of 2006 Kiambu CMs Court. After a full hearing he was found guilty and convicted of the offence and the sentence imposed was the mandatory DEATH sentence. Being aggrieved he lodged an appeal to the Kiambu High Court vide HCRA No.276 of 2009 and a second appeal thereafter to the Court of Appeal vide COA sitting in Nairobi; both appeals were dismissed and the sentence was affirmed.






3.
The Applicant now seeks a review of the sentence to a lenient and definite sentence.






4.
At the hearing hereof, the Applicant was unrepresented and relied on his supporting affidavit which he briefly highlighted; Mr Gacharia appearing for the State was not opposed to the application but requested that the Kiambu lower court record and a Victim Impact Report be availed to assist this court in making its decision in determining the appropriate sentence to be considered.






Applicant’s Case


5.
He was charged and convicted for the offence for the offence of Robbery with Violence Contrary to Section 296(2) of the Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 2032 of 2006 Kiambu CMs Court.






6.
He was found guilty and convicted of the offence and the sentence imposed was the mandatory DEATH sentence. Being aggrieved he lodged an appeal to the Kiambu High Court vide HCRA No.276 of 2009 and a second appeal thereafter to the Court of Appeal vide COA No.13 of 2020 sitting in Nairobi; both appeals were dismissed and the sentence was affirmed.






7.
The court was seized of competent jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter; he had been sentenced to a mandatory sentence as prescribed without due consideration of mitigation or the unique facts and circumstances of his case






8.
He prayed to be granted a definite and lenient sentence; and also prayed that the period spent in remand be taken into consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code;








Issues For Determination


9.
After hearing the rival submissions of the petitioner this court framed two issues for determination which were :
i.
Whether the Petitioner is deserving of a resentencing of his sentence.
ii.
Whether the Petitioner was deserving of the benefits of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.








Analysis

The court has had the occasion to peruse the Sentence Review Report dated 25/06/2024 prepared by the Probation Office to assist the court in making a determination; the report confirms the age of the applicant as 47 years and has spent 18 years in prison; when he committed he was young and used to abuse alcohol which would deter his sense of judgment and decision making; that during this period in prison he had time to reflect on his actions and was deeply remorseful and that he was now fully reformed and had been introduced to Scripture Theology and Spirituality in preparing himself to re-enter back into society and had prayed and sought forgiveness from the victim’s family; and the victims’ relatives had forgiven the applicant.






11.
That the applicant still had close family ties and believe the time he has spent in prison had a positive impact on his life; they were ready to help in his rehabilitation journey and to ensure he becomes a better person; the community had since forgiven him and recommended a non-custodial sentence to help him in his rehabilitation. The prison authorities positively recommended the petitioner’s release citing that he is no longer a threat to society.






12.
It is this court’s view that when considering to review the sentence it must take into consideration the following factors; firstly, the gravity of the offence and its prevalence; secondly, the facts and circumstances of the case and whether the applicant is repentant and genuinely remorseful for the unlawful act.






13.
Taking into consideration the circumstances in which the offence was committed this court notes that the applicant and his accomplices were charged with many other offences inclusive of rape and indecent acts to an adult; offence was carried out by a gang of youth and the group executed the attack on the victims home between 1-1.30 am; when they were sure that they were indoors and asleep and were in no position to escape; and the crime was executed in the most inhuman and degrading manner






14.
Indeed, the applicant realizes the gravity of the offence he committed and he is sorry and has demonstrated genuine remorse for what he did.






15.
The aggravating circumstances are found to far outweigh the applicant’s mitigating factors set out in the report; despite the mitigating factors the gravity and prevalence of such offences has also to be taken into consideration; and this court is of the considered view that there is a need to still impose a custodial sentence that will also act as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to commit similar offences;






16.
Nevertheless, the report filed herein is found to favour the applicant and in the circumstances this court is satisfied the applicant is deserving of only a review and reduction of life sentence imposed.








Findings And Determination


17.
For the forgoing reasons this court finds that the Petitioners Petition for re-sentencing is meritorious; and finds the most appropriate sentence for the offence committed to be a custodial term reduced to thirty (30) years;






18.
This court finds that the Petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






19.
The thirty (30) years shall run with effect from the date of sentencing being 22/02/2008.
Orders accordingly.

He further pointed out that there was no identification parade that was conducted. He finally submits that the prosecution failed to establish any motive on his part.






47.
The prosecution and the rest of the accused persons did not file any submissions.








Determination


48.
Section 203 of the penal code defines murder as follows: ""any person who of malice a forethought causes death of another person by an unlawful act or omission is guilty of murder.""






49.
The decision in the case of  Republic -vs- Mohamed Dodi Korane & 7 Others (2014) e KLR , provide further clarity on what constitutes murder. The court set out the ingredients of the offence as follows:
1)
The fact of the death of the decease and its cause.
2)
Proof that the deceased met his death as a result of an unlawful act or omission on the part of the accused.
3)
Proof that the said unlawful act or omission was committed with malice aforethought.








The Death of the deceased.


80.
Dr. Dickson Mchana’s report was adopted by the consent of the parties. According to the report, the doctor recorded that he conducted an autopsy on the body of Alfred Bihembo Ikambili on 19/11/2019 at about 11.50 am. The body was identified by peter kilova and Joseph Kashindi . He concluded that the cause of death was penetrating head injury due to sharp force trauma following Assault. Am satisfied therefore that the death of the deceased, and its cause was proved.








Whether the death was caused by the Accused persons


50.
The attack took place at around 8p.m. There are insignificant variations on the prosecution witnesses on the events that took place that night. The only and the critical issue is one of identification of the attackers.






51.
The case of R. vs. Turnbull and Others [ 1976] 3 All ER 549 Lord Widgery CJ lays down the law on identification. The court held as follows:
“
……..Secondly, the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in which the identification by each witness came to be make. How long did the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police? Was there any material discrepancy between the description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual appearance? ………….Finally, he should remind the jury of any specific weaknesses which had appeared in the identification evidence. Recognition may be more reliable than identification of a stranger: but, even when the witness is purporting to recognize someone whom he knows, the jury should be reminded that mistakes in recognition of close relative and friends are sometimes made.






52.
According to PW1 she went outside and found a man holding a panga. He attempted to slash her but she ran inside . She did not see his face as he had covered it. All she could tell were the clothes he wore. PW2 stated that he shone a torch light on the 1
st
 accused and at that point the accused slashed him. He further stated that the first accused had put on a mask but his eyes were uncovered. He insisted however that his torch helped in identification. In her evidence in chief PW3 told the court that she saw the person who pulled the deceased and cut him. She did not see his face but she saw the clothes he wore. On cross- examination however she said she knew the 1
st
 accussed ;she identified him by his name , philiph Imbuka. She knew him as they used to work within the same vicinity . She further stated that she was afraid to tell the police as she was not certain that she clearly saw him on the night of attack. She however denied that he wore a mask.






53.
It is evident that PW1 and PW3 did not see the face of the attacker who cut the deceased with a panga . Although PW3 insisted that the attacker did not have a face – mask on, she admitted that she was not certain about what she saw. In her evidence in chief , she stated that she did not see. In cross – examination she affirmed this position by stating that she hesitated in giving the name of the 1
st
 Accused to the police because she was not sure she identified him correctly .






54.
In my view , her hesitation indeed had a basis. She only saw the deceased being dragged out and being cut , she got up in an attempt to check what was happening and a panga was thrown at her. She did not know what happened outside, as she never went out.






55.
From the testimonies of the these first three witnesses therefore , it is evident that the only person who confidently stated that he saw the 1
st
 Accused on the scene was PW2. The next question then is, whether in the prevailing circumstances, PW2 was able to identify the 1
st
 accused in the manner he said he did.






56.
According to him, he identified the 1
st
 Accused when he shone a light on him for a brief moment before he was cut on the hand with a panga. He told the court that the despite the face mask worn by the 1
st
 Accused, he could still identify him as his eyes were visible.






57.
I have carefully considered the testimony of PW2. The pertinent question is; how reliable was this identification? Did it meet the test in Turnbull’s case? ( supra). If indeed the attacker had covered his head , gumboots on his feet and a face mask , then what PW2 was telling the court is that he identified him only through the eyes. For how long did he look at the attacker’s eyes? That question was not answered. How close were they to each other? Was there a chance to even take a long look, considering the circumstances? Was it even possible to identify a person just by the eyes in the prevailing circumstances. The witness had shone the torch on him and the attacker, obviously not wanting to be identified must have reacted immediately. Well my assessment may sound speculative , but the onus was on the prosecution to lead the witness to clarify this grey areas.






58.
In this regard I find support in the case of Abdala bin Wendo & Another v Republic (1953), 20 EACA 166 it was held: “Subject to certain well known exceptions it is trite law that a fact may be proved by the testimony of a single witness but this rule does not lessen the need for testing with the greatest care the evidence of a single witness respecting identification, especially when it is known that the conditions favouring a correct identification were difficult.” ( Emphasis added)






59.
In the circumstances of this case , am not persuaded that the identification of the 1
st
 accused met the threshold set out in Turnerbull’s case (supra).






60.
On the 2
nd
 Accused, PW3 told the court that she found the 2
nd
 Accused on the road as she and other were taking the deceased to hospital. The 2
nd
 Accused admitted as much that he was standing on the road. However none of the prosecution witnesses placed him on the scene of the attack.






61.
The 3
rd
 Accused was not placed on the scene by any of the prosecution witnesses.






62.
This is case in which the issue of identification ought to have been subjected to an identification parade. I consider this a failure on the part of the investigative Agency.






63.
To conclude on this issue , having failed to identify the attackers , it is my conclusion that none of the prosecution witnesses saw any of the accused persons attacking the deceased.






64.
This leaves the prosecution ‘s case hinging purely on circumstantial evidence.
7.
Circumstantial evidence was defined by the court of Appeal as “………evidence which enables a court to deduce a particular fact from circumstances or facts that have been proved………… It is evidence of surrounding circumstances which, by intensified examination is capable of proving a proposition with the accuracy of mathematics……” ( Ref: Ahamad Abbolfathi mohammed & Ano vs Republic ( 2018) e KLR
8.
In the same case, the Court of Appeal set out the test to be applied in considering whether circumstantial evidence placed before a court can support a conviction. The court stated:
“
Before circumstantial evidence can form the basis of a conviction however, it must satisfy several conditions, which are designed to ensure that it unerringly points to the Subject person, and to no other person, as the perpetrator of the offence. In Abanga alias Onyango v R Cr. App. No 32 of 1990, this court set out the conditions as follows: “It is settled law that when a case rests entirely on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy three tests:
i.
the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established;
ii.
those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the Subject;
iii.
the circumstances taken cumulatively, should from a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else.”






65.
Also in Sawe Vs. Republic [2003] KLR 364, the Court of Appeal held : “In order to justify on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. There must be no other co-existing circumstances weakening the chain of circumstances relied upon. The burden of proving facts that justify the drawing of this inference from the facts to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis of innocence remain with the prosecution. It is a burden which never shift to the party accused.” ( Emphasis added)






66.
The circumstances of this case revolve around two motor bikes found about 200 meters from the scene from the scene of crime, the arrest of the 2
nd
 Accused by members of the public from the same spot, call- logs from Safaricom Ltd, mpesa statements from the same company and a search certificate for Qool point Ltd.






67.
PW10 produced the call- logs and mpesa statements from Safaricom. The two documents were accompanied by a certificate; the particulars of the computer used and the printer were provided under paragraph 4 of the certificate. There was therefore due compliance with section 106(A) and (B) of the 
Evidence Act
.






68.
The 2
nd
 Accused was found on the road , 200 metres from the scene of the attack. He admitted that he carried two people from sigalagala and the third hiked a separate motorbike. The “people” left him on the road and followed a footpath. Soon thereafter screams were heard from the direction that his passengers had headed to. This corroborates the testimonies of PW1 and PW3 who told the court that they screamed when they were attacked. His fellow Rider, whom he identified as Kevin, ran away leaving his motorbike on the scene. The two motor bikes were later seized by members of the public and handed over to the police ( PExb. 6(a)- 6(b) and 7(a )and 7(b) ). The admission by the 2
nd
 Accused, and the conduct of his fellow Rider, plus the two motorbikes on the scene indicate that indeed the 2
nd
 Accused had carried the attackers.






69.
The mpesa statement show that he was paid ks. 100 by the 1
st
 Accused that day at about 19 hours . That was just about one hour before the attack. The mpesa statement also show that he was paid ksh. 200 the previous day, again by the 1
st
 Accused.






70.
Further , by his own admission , he did carry people who turned out to have been the attackers. The motorbike used was registered to him and the said motorbike was found in the scene ( PExb. 6 (a) and 6(b) . In his defence , he insisted that he just carried passengers ; that he never went to the scene of the attack. However if he was being paid ksh. 100 as fare for ferrying unknown passengers on the 7 /11/ 2019, what then was he being paid for on 6/11/2019 by the 1
st
 Accused. Am not persuaded by this plea of innocence .






71.
The 1
st
 accused was not placed on the scene, but it is evident that he was facilitating the transportation of the attackers . His allegation that he was paying the 2
nd
 Accused for transportation of his meat was denied by the 2
nd
 Accused. The 2
nd
 accused also denied that he ever did any work for the 1
st
 Accused. In any event it does not also explain why the previous day he made a payment of ksh. 200 to the 2
nd
 Accused .






72.
Further the 1
st
 Accused told the court that he came to know the 2
nd
 Accused on the day he asked him to transport meat , yet the mpesa statement showed that on 6/11/2019, he paid him ksh. 200 . Why then was he paying money to a “ stranger” the previous day, if he did not know him before, as alleged.






73.
Further the call- logs from Safaricom ( PExb 3(a) to (3h) ), shows constant communication between him and one Alex wejenje. These calls increased in frequency towards the day of the murder and even more frequently towards the evening of the murder.






74.
There was nothing much that came from the prosecution’s witnesses touching on the said Alex Wenjenje. It is only the investigation’s officer ( PW11) who told the court, on cross- examination, that he has looked for Alex Wejenje to no avail. However the call- logs from Safaricom show that there were unusually high number of telephone calls exchanged between the 1
st
 Accused and the said Alex and with increased frequency on the countdown to the incident and during the incident.






75.
This is what the call- logs show;- On 7 / 11/ 2019 the 1
st
 accused and Alex wenjenje exchanged 20 phone calls between 20.18 and 21.02 hours, 4 calls between 21.32 hours and 21.34 hours, and 6 phone calls between 21.36 hours and 23.07 hours. There were also two calls made at 19.16 hours between the 1
st
 Accused and and qool point Ltd. According to the search certificate on a search carried out at the companies Registry qool point Ltd is owned by Alex Wejenje and one Emmanel wafula. The following day , that is on 8/11/2019, the the 1
st
 Accussed and the same Alex exchanged 11 phone calls.






76.
The exchange was certainly not normal. It indicates that the two were commonly conducting an urgent and unusual business.






77.
Turning to the 3
rd
 Accused. He told the court that a friend by the name Alex wijenje requested for his motorbike to ferry his friends , and because his own Motorbike was not available he asked the 2
nd
 Accused to ferry Alex’s friends.






78.
The call-logs from Safaricom show that the he exchanged eight phone calls with Alex wejenje on the day of the incident and nine calls the following day. This is the Alex who it later emerged from 3
rd
 Accused’s defence had made a request for a motorbike to ferry “some friends”. The particulars of the calls indicate the following: On 7/11/2019, at 18.06 hours the two exchanged 3 calls, at 19.14 hours 2 calls were exchanged, and at 19. 16 there were 3 calls. On 8 /11/2019 there were 3 calls exchanged at 7.14 hours, 3 calls at 09.46 hours and another 3 calls at 10.31 hours.






79.
In his defence the 3
rd
 Accused told the court that on 7 /11/2019, Alex had called him to request for a motorbike and on 8 /11/2019 he had called him to inquire about an alleged arrest of the 2
nd
 Accused. I find this explanation not plausible. Why would a mere incidental request for a Ride required a total of 8 phone calls on that day? Again why would such a request take a span of more than an hour, as the logs show that they talked between 18.06 to 19.06 hours on the 7
th
 November? The following day there were a total of 9 calls made between 7.14 and 10.31 hours. Why would again, a simple inquiry about the 2
nd
 Accused arrest required 9 calls?. Am persuaded that the calls were merely on innocent inquiries






80.
What do all these exchanges demonstrate ? They showed that the three Accused and one Alex wejenje were working to gather with a common intend, namely to kill the deceased.






81.
Am satisfied that beginning with the 2
nd
 Accussed presence at about 200 metres from the crime scene; his own Admission that indeed he carried people who then alighted and went towards the direction of the deceased’s house; the screams emanating from the same direction, the actual attack of the deceased at the same time ; the presence of the 2
nd
 Accused’s motorbike on the road: the payment of ksh. 100 and ksh 200 to his mpesa account by the 3
rd
 Accused there is a chain that connects 2
nd
 actions with the 1
st
 accused .






82.
For the 1
st
 Accused the two payments aforesaid connects him to the 1
st
 accused and the actions he took that day. The many phone calls exchanged with Alex wejenje up to the minute of the attack places him as a central player in the commission of the crime.






83.
For the 3
rd
 Accused his own admission that he did ask the 2
nd
 Accused to ferry Alex wejenje’s “ friends” and the many phone calls he exchanged with Alex also shows that he was a key player in the whole chain.






84.
It is also evident that Alex wejenje , the one who has eluded the investigators , was the key player in the commission of the crime.






85.
For the court to convict on circumstantial evidence, there must be a link or a series of events which when linked together excludes the innocence of the accused.( Ref: Ahamad Abolfathi- supra).






86.
It is my finding that as was held in the case of Mwita v. Republic (2004) 2KLR 6 the inculpatory facts in this case are inconsistent with the innocence of the accused persons and are incapable of explanation upon any other hypothesis than guilt. The chain of events complete the chain.






87.
Further the many phone calls exchanged, the money paid , their own admissions as well as the accounts of the prosecution’s witnesses show that the three accused persons and one other, were working together, for a common purpose, namely to kill the deceased. On common purpose , section 21 of the Penal Code provides as follows: When two or more persons form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another, and in the prosecution of such purpose an offence is committed of such a nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose, each of them is deemed to have committed the offence






88.
Circumstantially therefore , am satisfied that the prosecution has proved , beyond reasonable doubt that there three Accused persons participated in the killing of the deceased.








Malice aforethought.


89.
The phone calls and Mpesa statement of the 1
st
 Accused indicating that he sent ksh. 200 to the 2
nd
 Accused on 6/11/2019 and calls between the 3
rd
 Accused and Alex wejenje which began as early as 18.06 hours and several phone calls between the 1
st
 Accused and Alex wejenje shows that there was prior and apparently intense planning of the crime. There was malice preceding the act.






90.
The deceased too was hit on the head . According to the pathologist the injury on the head was caused by a sharp force trauma. The Accused persons knew that such an injury was likely to cause a fatal injury. Section 206 of the penal code sets out the circumstances which constitute malice aforethought as:
“
a).
an intention to cause death of or to do grievous harm to any person whether that person is the person actually netted or not;
(b)
Knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether that person is the person actually netted or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused.






91.
The Accused persons must have known that hitting the deceased on the head with a sharp object was likely to cause grievous harm or death to the deceased. Malice aforethought was therefore proved.






92.
In conclusion, it is my finding that the prosecution has proved the charge of murder against all the accused persons. I hereby find the 1
st
 , 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 accused persons guilty of the offence of murder contrary to section 203 as read with section 204 of the penal code, and I hereby convict them accordingly.

Judgment










1.
The Petition dated 7
th
 June 2022 alleges that the 1
st
 Respondent has failed to set up and operationalize the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) in compliance with Sections 66 and 67 of the 
Basic Education Act
 which mandates the Council to uphold quality assurance in basic education in Kenya.






2.
The Petition is supported by the Petitioner’s affidavit in support of similar date and a supplementary affidavit dated 7
th
 November 2023. Consequently, the Petitioner is seeking the following relief:
a.
A declaration do issue that the 1
st
 Respondent's (Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Education) default in appointing the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council and Quality Assurance Officers as envisaged under Sections 66 and 67 of the 
Basic Education Act
 contravenes and grossly violates the right to quality education guaranteed under Article 53 of 
the Constitution
 and as enumerated in the Petition herein.
b.
A declaration do issue that pursuant to Article 10(2)(a) and (b) of 
the Constitution
, the 1
st
 Respondent is bound by the Principles of Patriotism, Public Participation, Transparency, Fairness, Human rights, and Good Governance in the execution of the terms of his portfolio and duties appurtenant to the Education sector in Kenya as spelt out in the applicable statutory regimes, and his failure to appoint the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council and Quality Assurance Officers to date is a violation of these Principles and Values.
c.
An Order of Mandamus do issue, to compel the 1
st
 Respondent to forthwith (and not later than 14 days from the date of this demand) set up the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC), to be headed by the Petitioner herein (as already appointed) and to appoint and Gazette the relevant officers to work under the Petitioner as by law envisaged, and prescribe such of the requisite Regulations necessary to give effect to the terms of ESQAC as spelt out in the 
Basic Education Act
.
d.
An Order of Mandamus do issue, to compel the 1
st
 Respondent to forthwith that he forthwith (and not later than 14 days from the date of this demand) authorize the payment of honoraria and applicable allowances to the Petitioner for the period he has remained appointed as Chair of the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council ESQAC, to date, according to the guidelines applicable in that respect under the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.
e.
The Costs of this Petition be awarded to the Petitioner.






Petitioner’s case


3.
For context, Part IX of the 
Basic Education Act
 establishes the Education and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) to administer policies and guidelines for quality basic education. The Council’s terms of engagement are stipulated under Section 66 of the Act.






4.
The Petitioner depones that on 4
th
 February 2019, the 1
st
 Respondent (then Hon. Amina Mohammed) appointed him as the Chairman of the ESQAC. This appointment was to be a term of 4 years, commencing on 18
th
 February 2019.He asserts that as at the time of filing this Petition his appointment had not been varied or revoked and was set to lapse on 18
th
 February 2023.






5.
He avers that the honoraria for the position was Ksh.80, 000. He informs that his predecessor, one Kiragu wa Magochi appointed on 4
th
 September 2014 had been paid this sum for his service throughout his term. Furthermore, that the honoraria was equally affirmed and approved by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission vide a letter Ref: SRC/TS/CBT/3/3 VOL.II (56). It is his assertion thus that the 1
st
 Respondent owes him this payment for the term he served.






6.
Following a Cabinet reshuffle in government, the Petitioner vide a letter dated 17
th
 April 2019, informed the newly appointed 1
st
 Respondent (at the time Prof. George Magoha) of his employment details. In addition, he indicated the need to retain him as the Chairperson while seeking guidance for the future of the ESQAC. He asserts that this communication was not responded to.






7.
The Petitioner proceeded to send a follow up letter on 17
th
 October 2019. In addition to this, he attempted to have a physical meeting with the 1
st
 Respondent however this was also futile. Distressed by the lack of response, the Petitioner on 10
th
 January 2020 wrote to the Head of Public Service seeking his intervention. Similarly, he sent out a further follow up letter on 16
th
 March 2020 which was also not responded to.






8.
The Petitioner is aggrieved since he asserts that the 1
st
 Respondent is in breach of Sections 64 and 65 of the 
Basic Education Act
. That is, failure to give effect to the statutory intention of a functional and operational Council as stipulated therein. Considering this, he emphasizes that the dictates of Section 66 of the Act have not been met. As a consequence, he claims that there is no oversight authority to monitor and regulate the quality of education in Kenya.






9.
He makes known that the Department of Education obtains Kshs.40,000,000 yearly for operationalization of the ESQAC, however this has not been possible or beneficial as the Council remains unfunctional.






10.
The Petitioner as well contends that the 1
st
 Respondent’s omission is in violation of the constitutional right to quality education and dignity. Moreover, that the continued non-operationalization of the Council violates the right against psychological torture occasioned on the teachers and students. This is since the curriculum being utilized lacks assessment of quality assurance as required by law. In like manner, he proclaims that the Respondents’ failure to respond to his correspondence violated his right to a fair and expeditious fair administrative action.








1
st
 Respondent’s Case


11.
The 1
st
 Respondent vide a replying affidavit sworn by Dr. Belio R. Kipsang on 18
th
 October 2023, asserts that the Petitioner’s appointment as the ESQAC Chairman was null and void ab initio.






12.
The 1
st
 Respondent informs that Section 64(3) of the 
Basic Education Act
 empowers the Cabinet Secretary to formulate Regulation with regard to the composition, appointment and terms of service of the Council’s membership.






13.
It is noted however that the 2019 Regulations were invalid. The 1
st
 Respondent makes known that these Regulations were never forwarded to the National Assembly for approval as dictated under Section 11(1) of the 
Statutory Instruments Act
.






14.
For this reason, the 1
st
 Respondent claims that since the appointment was null and void ab initio, the Petitioner did not render any service or perform any function so as to justify payment of honoraria and the applicable allowances.






15.
Equally, the 1
st
 Respondent refuted the allegation of lack of quality in basic education terming it as speculative and without a legal basis.








2
nd
 Respondent’s Case


16.
In response, the 2
nd
 Respondent filed its grounds of opposition dated 28
th
 September 2023 on the basis that:
i.
The Petition is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, devoid of merit and an abuse of the court process.
ii.
The appointment of members of ESQAC was based on the 2019 Regulations, (enacted pursuant to Section 64(3) of the 
Basic Education Act
) which were invalid. This is because the Regulations were never forwarded to the National Assembly for approval as required under Section 11(1) of the 
Statutory Instruments Act
 No. 23 of 2013. As such, they ceased to have any force of law.
iii.
Accordingly, the appointment of the Petitioner as the Chairman of the Education Standard and Quality Assurance Council was null and void ab initio. Considering this, the Petitioner was not entitled to payment of honoraria and applicable allowances for the period.
iv.
The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate the basis for the alleged honoraria payment and neither is it anchored on any known legislation or regulations.
v.
For the foregoing reasons, the relief sought by the Petitioner is improper, and therefore incapable of being granted by this Court.








Petitioner’s Submissions


17.
J. Harrison Kinyanjui and Company Advocates for the Petitioner filed submissions dated 29
th
 September 2023. Counsel begun by affirming that the Petition was pleaded with precision and specificity on the violated constitutional provisions thus satisfying the threshold set out in Anarita Karimi Nieru v Attorney General (1979) KLR 54 and Matiba v Attorney General (1990) KLR 666).






18.
The Petitioner as well took issue with the Respondents’ failure to make its response in a replying affidavit. Reliance was placed in Peter O. Nyakundi & 68 others vs Principal Secretary. State Department of Planning£ Ministry of Devolution and Planning & another (2016)eKLR where it was held that:
“
As stated earlier the respondents did not file any replying affidavit to challenge and/or controvert the sworn averment by the petitioners that they were victims of the post-election violence. Ground of Opposition which were filed are only deemed to address issues of law.”






19.
Like dependence was placed in 
Gulleid v Registrar of Persons & another (Petition E007 of 2021
,) (2021) KEHC I 10 (KLR) (27 September 2021) (Judgment). It is worthy to note that the Respondents’ went on to file their replying affidavit sworn on 18
th
 October 2023.






20.
Turning to the substantive issue, Counsel maintained that the 1
st
 Respondent’s actions and omissions constituted a violation of the Petitioner’s and affected Children’s right to dignity under Article 28 of 
the Constitution
. Reliance was placed in Jesse Waweru Wahome & 42 Others V Kenya Engineers Registration Board & 3 Others (2012) eKLR where it was held that:
“
(c)
I hereby declare that the Engineers Registration Board has violated the petitioners right to fair administrative action protected by Article 4 7 (I) of 
the Constitution
 and the petitioners right to human dignity protected by Article 28 of 
the Constitution
 as read with Article 55(a) and (c) of 
the Constitution
.”






21.
Similar dependence was placed in MWK v another v Attorney General & 3 others (2017) eKLR.






22.
Counsel additionally on violation of Article 29 (d) of 
the Constitution
 claimed that the continued non-operationalization of the ESQAC and the non-appointment of the quality assurance officers amounts to psychological torture on the teachers and students. Especially now with the new untested Competence Based Curriculum (CBC).






23.
Counsel avowed likewise that 1
st
 Respondent's failure to respond to the Petitioner's inquiry constituted a violation of the Petitioner's right to fair, expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair administrative action as enshrined under Article 47 (1) of 
the Constitution
.






24.
In support Counsel cited the case of Judicial Service Commission v Mbalu Mutava Musyimi (2015) eKLR where it was held that:
“
Article 47(1) marks an important and transformative development of administrative justice for, it not only lays a Constitutional foundation for control of the powers of state organs and other administrative bodies, but also entrenches the right to fair administrative action in the Bill of Rights. The right to fair administrative action is a reflection of some of the national values in Article IO such as the rule of law, human dignity, social justice, good governance, transparency, and accountability. The administrative actions of public officers, state organs and other administrative bodies are now subjected by article 47(1) to the principle of Constitutionality rather than to the doctrine of ultra vires from which administrative law under the common law was developed.""






25.
Inevitably, Counsel claimed that the Respondents’ had violated the children’s right to access basic education as envisaged under Article 53(1)(b) of 
the Constitution
. This is since the lack of ESQAC has affected the quality of basic education and hence students are graduating from school without any form of quality assurance putting their credentials into question.






26.
Congruently, Counsel asserted that the Petitioner had been treated unfairly in view of the Respondents’ conduct following his appointment. Reliance was placed in Mutuku Ndambuki Matinii v Rafiki Microfinance Bank Limited (2021) eKLR where it was held that:
“


50.
As regards the right to dignity, in Ahmed lssack Hassan vs. Auditor General [2015] the Court held that:
"" ... the right to human dignity is the foundation of all other right and together with the right to life, forms the basis for the enjoyment of all other rights ... put differently thereof, if a person enjoys the other rights in the Bill of rights, the right to human dignity will automatically be promoted and protected and it will be violated if the other rights are violated"".










Respondents’ Submissions


27.
State Counsel, Christopher Marwa for the Respondents’, filed submissions dated 14
th
 December 2023 where he outlined the issue for determination as whether the Petitioner’s constitutional rights had been violated by the Respondents.






28.
To commence with, Counsel submitted that the Petitioner’s requisition to be retained as the Chairperson for the Council was in violation of the 1
st
 Respondent’s discretionary power to appoint. Nevertheless, it was noted that Regulation 9 of the Basic Education (Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council) Regulations, stipulates the term of office as 4 years. As such the Petitioner’s appointment lawfully lapsed on 18
th
 February 2023.In essence, Counsel argued that Prayers (c) and (d) as outlined in the Petition had been overtaken by events.






29.
Counsel further argued that the allegation that failure to constitute the ESQAC had compromised the quality of basic education in Kenya was false. This is because Section 69 of the 
Basic Education Act
 makes it clear that the 1
st
 Respondent shall in consultation with the relevant departments or agencies and stakeholders through regulations and appropriate measures continuously review, evaluate and monitor policies on standards and relevance in education and training to assure and ensure standards, quality and relevance.






30.
For this reason, it was asserted that the Respondents’ had upheld their mandate to provide the right to education as safeguarded under Article 43(1)(f) of 
the Constitution
. Even so, Counsel submitted that the Petitioner had not demonstrated how the Respondents’ had violated this right and neither had the Petition been pleaded with precision in this regard.






31.
Reliance was placed in Calvin Ouma Magare & 18 others v Director of Public Prosecutions & 4 others (2022) eKLR where it was held that:
“
It is trite law that the burden of proving violation or threat of violation is upon the Petitioners as was established in Anarita Karimi Njeru (supra) and reiterated by the Court of Appeal in Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance & 5 others (2013) eKLR. In addition, it is also settled that the Petitioners must patently express the manner in which the Respondents have violated their rights.”






32.
Similar reliance was also placed in Susan Wangari Mburu & 5 others v Eldoret Water & Sanitation Company Limited & another (2021) eKLR.






33.
On issuance of the order of mandamus, Counsel submitted that the Petitioner had not met the threshold for grant of this order as set out in Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1100.The Court held as follows:
“
i)
There must be a public legal duty to act;
(ii)
The duty must be owed to the Applicants;
(iii)
There must be a clear right to the performance of that duty, meaning that:
a.
The Applicants have satisfied all conditions precedent; and
b.
There must have been:
I.
A prior demand for performance;
II.
A reasonable time to comply with the demand, unless there was outright refusal; and
III.
An express refusal, or an implied refusal through unreasonable delay;
(iv)
No other adequate remedy is available to the Applicants;
(v)
The Order sought must be of some practical value or effect;
(vi)
There is no equitable bar to the relief sought;
(vii)
On a balance of convenience, mandamus should lie.”






34.
Counsel in light of this contended that the prayers sought had been overtaken by events for the reason that the term of office had lapsed, thus issuing the same would be in vain. Additionally, it was noted that the impugned function under Section 69 of the 
Basic Education Act
, is ably performed by the 1
st
 Respondent.






35.
In like manner, it was maintained that the Petitioner had failed to show, how the quality of education had been compromised and the legal basis for the alleged honoraria payment. To this end, Counsel reasoned that the Petitioner had failed to sustain his case against the Respondents and hence the Petition should be dismissed.








Analysis and Determination


36.
From the foregoing account, the issues that arise for determination in my view are:
i.
Whether the Respondents’ violated the Petitioner’s rights under Articles 28, 29(d), 47 (1) and 53(1)(b) of 
the Constitution
;
ii.
Whether the Respondents’ are in breach of their statutory mandate as envisaged under Section 64-67 of the 
Basic Education Act
 and
iii.
Whether the Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs sought.






37.
I will however confine myself to issue No. 2 and 3 only in view of the last-minute amendment of the Petition on 24/1/2024 when the matter came up for highlighting of submissions. The Advocate for the Petitioner, Mr. Harrison Kinyanjui dropped the prayer for mandamus on appointment of the Petitioner as the Chairman of the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) instead adopted a more general relief. The essence of that was that individual claims of violation were extinguished. By the same token, out goes prayer (d) as it cannot stand alone and thus the only viable issue to consider is the issue of the failure to establish the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) in line with the provisions of the 
Basic Education Act
. In orally moving this particular amendment, Mr. Harrison Kinyanjui, the Petitioner’s Advocate explained:
“
Before I commence, I wish to have prayer (c) of the Petition amended due to effluxion of time between lodging of the Petition and now, the Petitioner is no longer the person supposed to Head the Education and Standards Quality Assurance Council because his appointment lapsed on 18/2/2023. Second reason, it is proper that the Court issues such expedient orders in line with prevailing circumstances as opposed to state of facts not supported by prevailing circumstances. I have contextually laid the basis of that proposition. Prayer no. (c) we will delete line 3, 4 & 5 ‘… the entire prayer will now read:
‘An order of mandamus do issue to compel the 1
st
 Respondent Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Education and Technology to formally and not later than 14 days of this order to set up the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) and to appoint and gazette the relevant officers as by law envisaged and to prescribe the requisite regulations necessary to give effect to the terms of ESQAC as spelt out in the 
Basic Education Act
.”






38.
As such I will thus turn go straight to issue number 2, which is:
Whether the Respondents are in breach of their statutory mandate as envisaged under Section 64-67 of the 
Basic Education Act






39.
The Respondents’ mandate is provided for under the 
Basic Education Act
. It is necessary to set out the relevant Constitutional and statutory provisions relied upon by the Petitioner in challenging the Respondents non-enforcement decision.






40.

42.
In Daniel Ingida Aluvaala & another v Council of Legal Education & another (2017) eKLR the Court observed that:
“


13.
Public bodies, no matter how well-intentioned, may only do what the law empowers them to do. That is the essence of the principle of legality, the bedrock of our constitutional dispensation, which is enshrined in our constitution. It follows that for the impugned decisions to be allowed to stand, it must be demonstrated that the decision is grounded on law.






14.
As such, the Respondents actions must conform to the doctrine of legality. Put differently, a failure to exercise that power where the exigencies of a particular case require it, would amount to undermining the legality principle which, is inextricably linked to the rule of law. Guidance can be obtained from the South African case of AAA Investments (Pty) Ltd vs Micro Finance Regulatory Council and another where the court held as follows:
“(t)he doctrine of legality which requires that power should have a source in law, is applicable whenever public power is exercised . . . . Public power . . . can be validly exercised only if it is clearly sourced in law""[3]






15.
Courts are similarly constrained by the doctrine of legality, i.e. to exercise only those powers bestowed upon them by the law.[4] The concomitant obligation to uphold the rule of law and, with it, the doctrine of legality, is self-evident. In this regard, the Respondent is constrained by that doctrine to enforce the law by ensuring that its decisions conform to the relevant provisions of the law governing examinations offered at the Kenya School of Law.






16.
The respondent has not only a statutory duty but also a moral duty to uphold the law and to ensure due compliance with the law and Regulations…”








43.
Nevertheless, a 3- Judge bench in Kiriro Wa Ngugi & 19 others v Attorney General & 2 others (2020) eKLR sounded a word of caution to the court reviewing the actions and/or inactions of other arms of government by stating thus:
“


97.
A Court must satisfy itself that the case before it is not caught up by the bar of non-justiciability. The concept of non-justiciability is comprised of three doctrines: Firstly, the Political Question Doctrine; secondly, the Constitutional-Avoidance Doctrine; and, thirdly, the Ripeness Doctrine… 98. We shall commence with the political question doctrine. Black’s Law Dictionary, 10
th
 Edition, Thomson Reuters Publishers, at page 1346 defines it as:
The judicial principle that a court should refuse to decide an issue involving the discretionary power by the executive or legislative branch of government.






99.
The political question doctrine focuses on the limitations upon adjudication by Courts of matters generally within the area of responsibility of other arms of Government….”








44.
Consequently, the Court concluded as follows in this respect:
100.
According to the political question doctrine, certain sets of issues categorized as political questions, even though they may include legal issues, are considered to be external to the Judiciary as an arm of Government. Such issues are handed over to other branches of Government for adjudication. The political question doctrine therefore focuses on limiting of adjudication of disputes by courts in favour of the legislative and the executive interventions. It is underpinned by the concept of separation of powers. All that the Courts are doing in such situations is assigning discretion on the issue to another branch of Government.






45.
After rendering the above precaution, the bench proceeded to justify interference by the Court in certain circumstances as follows:
“


102.
In the William Odhiambo Ramogi & 2 others v Attorney General & 6 Others case [supra], the learned judges also dealt with the exceptions to the doctrine as follows:
[89]..…
that there are constitutionally permissible situations where this Court may interfere in the policy decisions of the Government, and particularly if a policy decision is in actual or threatened violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under 
the Constitution
, or in violation of other provisions of 
the Constitution
. The necessity of vindicating constitutionally secured personal liberties and fundamental freedoms is the principal justification for the anti-majoritarian power that judicial review confers upon the Courts, and we are therefore reluctant to find that a claim of fundamental rights, such as the one presented by the Petitioners is non-justiciable, even though it may concern the political process, or the internal workings of other government branches.”








46.
In the United States case of Heckler vs Chaney 470 US 821 death row inmates challenged the Food and Drugs Administration refusal to initiate the enforcement action to block the use of certain drugs in lethal injection. The Supreme Court did not agree with the case of the inmates on the grounds that the Drug Agencies decision was dependent on complicated balancing of many factors that were peculiarly within its expertise and was thus better endowed to evaluate those variables than the Court would, hence was a matter within its discretion. The Supreme Court however went ahead and made a decision on the guiding standards that may be applied against the presumption of judicial review of an administrative non-enforcement decision based on discretional deference. The Supreme Court identified specific situations such as where the statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers stating that in such cases, the Court will have been supplied with the law to apply in reviewing the decision. The other would be when the administrative agency has adopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to abdication of statutory responsibilities.






47.
In the present case, the Petitioner contended that the 1
st
 Respondent's (Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Education) omission to appoint the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) and Quality Assurance Officers provided for under Sections 66 and 67 of the 
Basic Education Act
 undermines the principle of rule of law contained Article 10(2)(a) and (b) of 
the Constitution
 in the execution of portfolio duties appurtenant to the Education Sector in Kenya which dilutes education standards and thus is a violation of Article 53 of 
the Constitution
.






48.
The word ‘shall’ is used in Section 64 of the 
Basic Education Act
 which provides for the establishment of the Education Standards and the Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC). Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word ‘shall’ as follows: “Has a duty to: more broadly, is required to. This is the mandatory sense that drafters typically intend and that Courts typically uphold.”






49.
This means unlike situations where the Executive may have been given a discretion to exercise, Parliament which has the constitutional mandate to enact the law, did not leave any room for maneuver by the Executive in regard to the establishment of the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Advisory Council (ESQAC). It did not give the Executive (the Respondents) the latitude to fail to act, delay or implement this particular provision in piecemeal manner and that is why it is coached in the mandatory word ‘shall’. To allow the Executive (read Respondents) to act as it wishes in the circumstances will be to diminish the authority law and to that extent that of Parliament against the Constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.






50.
This Statutory provision should be read alongside Article 10 (2) (a) which incorporates the rule of law principle as part and parcel of values and principles of governance. To allow the Respondents to abdicate a compulsory statutory obligation is to condone arbitrariness which offends the rule of law. Besides, it will be denying the Children the benefit of getting quality education standards which is the objective behind that provision in the 
Basic Education Act
 that is geared toward ensuring that quality education standards are maintained through this structure.






51.
The Respondents argument that the Petitioner did not demonstrate by way of evidence that educational standards have fallen due to non-establishment of the ESQAC Council is untenable as principally what is in issue is the arbitrary refusal to implement an express statutory provision for which it has no discretion to exercise. In my view, the conscious failure to appoint the ESQAC Council against an express statutory provision entitles this Court to review the inaction of the Respondents on the basis of the rule of law principle which is the hallmark of our Constitutional democracy as the Executive does not have the Constitutional power to disregard specific duty imposed by the Statute. It is thus not a question of evidence perse but the duty to respect and uphold the law and constitutionalism that is in issue here. In any event, I would hold that deliberate failure to enforce a specific statutory provision whose objective is clear amounts undermining the achievement of the stated purpose to the detriment of the public. The Petitioner’s duty ended at establishing the 1
st
 respondent’s had failed to enforce an express legal duty to promote education standards by appointing an oversight body (ESQAC). Despite the mandatory nature of Section 64 of the 
Basic Education Act
, the 1
st
 Respondent could not explain why it has failed to execute the mandatory duty imposed by the 
Basic Education Act
 to establish the ESQAC Council. This is my view is breach of rule of law principle under Article 10 (2) (a) of 
the Constitution
. The establishment of the ESQAC is a legal command that is not subject to the 1
st
 Respondent’s discretion. I thus find and hold that the failure by the 1
st
 Respondent to establish the ESQAC against the requirement of Section 64 is an affront to the rule of law principle under Article 10(2)(a) on values and principles of governance and is invalid and unconstitutional. Fundamentally, under the separation of powers principle, Parliament which is vested with law making authority directs how the law shall be implemented and where it decides Executive shall have no discretion and shall act as directed, then it would be allowing executive overreach by giving it the latitude to disregard or suspend the law yet it does not have such powers under 
the Constitution
.






52.
Having reached this finding, the reliefs that commend themselves to this Petition are as follows:
a.
A declaration is hereby issued that the 1
st
 Respondent (Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Education) default in establishing the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council against the express provisions of Section 64 of the 
Basic Education Act
 is against the rule of law principle which forms part of values and principles of governance under Article 10 (2) (a) and further undermines the objective to attain quality education under Article 53 of 
the Constitution
 hence this omission to implement this specific legal provision is invalid and unconstitutional.
b.
An order of Mandamus is hereby issued compelling the 1
st
 Respondent to establish in accordance with Section 64 of the 
Basic Education Act
, the Education Standards and Quality Assurance Council (ESQAC) and to appoint relevant officers as by law envisaged and to prescribe such regulations necessary to give effect to the terms of ESQAC as spelt out in 
Basic Education Act
 within 60 days from the date hereof.
c.
This being a public interest litigation, I make no orders as to costs.

Judgment










1.
The appellant had been sued by the respondents, at the primary court, for compensation arising out of the death of Zaphania Kiptoo Kipyegomen, to be referred hereafter as the deceased, following a road traffic accident on 6
th
 November 2020, along Baraka Road. The deceased was a pedestrian on the said road, and was knocked down by motor vehicle registration mark and number KBP 252V, said to have belonged to the appellant, and liability was attributed on the appellant on account of negligence. The appellant filed a defence, admitting the accident, but denying everything else pleaded in the plaint, and, in the alternative pleading contribution on the part of the deceased.






2.
A trial was conducted. 2 witnesses testified for the respondents, while 1 testified for the appellant. Judgment was delivered on 15
th
 September 2022. On liability, the court held the appellant 50% liable and the deceased 50%. On quantum, the court awarded Kshs. 100,000.00 for pain and suffering and Kshs. 150,000.00 for loss of expectation of life; Kshs. 10,634,160.00 for loss of dependency; and Kshs. 550.00 being special damages; all totalling Kshs. 10,884,610.00. Upon subjecting the total judgment award to contribution, the amount came to Kshs. 5,442,355.00.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The appeal has raised several grounds revolving around liability and quantum.






4.
On 12
th
 June 2023, directions were given, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. Both parties filed written submissions.






5.
The appellant has argued on only 2 grounds: liability and quantum. On liability, he submits that the respondents did not provide eyewitness evidence on how the accident happened, and, therefore, there was inadequate evidence to establish negligence on the part of the appellant. He cites Violet Kamwenga Odiara & another (suing as the administratrix of the Estate of the late Timothy Odiara Ndege) vs. Kiprono Chemwono [2019] eKLR (SM Githinji, J), Benter Atieno Obonyo vs. Anne Nganga & another [2021] eKLR (Chemitei, J), Catherine Wambui Njogu vs. Jacob Mash Shake & another [2019] eKLR (Okwany, J) and Stephen Kanjabi Wariari vs. Dennis Mutwiri Muriuki & another [2022] (Njuguna, J). He urges that the trial court should have found the deceased wholly liable for what befell him, and liability should have been assessed at 100% against him.






6.
On quantum, he has submitted on several sub-heads. On loss of expectation of life, he argues that the award of Kshs. 200,000.00 was on the higher side, given that the deceased was aged 27 years at the time of his death. He urges that Kshs. 100,000.00 would have been adequate. He relies on Hyder Nthenya Musili & another vs. China Wu Yi Limited & another [2017] eKLR (Nyamweya, J) and Njiru Benson Murage vs. Peter Njue Zachariah (suing as the administrator of the estate of Justin Mukundi Njue [2019] eKLR (Muchemi, J). On pain and suffering, he submits that the award of Kshs. 100,000.00 was on the higher side, and argues that the award should have been Kshs. 50,000.00, relying on Hyder Nthenya Musili & another vs. China Wu Yi Limited & another [2017] eKLR (Nyamweya, J).






7.
On the multiplier used of 30, for someone aged 27 years, he submits that the same was on the higher side, and argues that a multiplier of 20 should have been adopted, after taking into account the vagaries and uncertainties of life. He cites Rose Wangui Machua & another vs. Japheth Mbiuki [2016] eKLR (Msagha, J), where a multiplier of 20 was adopted for a 23 year-old; and Mary Kerubo Mabuka vs. Newton Mucheke Mburu & 3 others [2006] eKLR (Kimaru, J), where a multiplier of 20 was adopted for a 26 year-old. It is submitted that the life expectancy of Kenyans has reduced due to poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and road traffic accidents. He does not challenge the multiplicand and dependency ratio adopted and applied by the court.






8.
On their part, the respondents submit on the 2 grounds argued by the appellant: on liability and quantum. On liability, the respondents support the conclusions arrived at by the trial court. They rely on the principle that where there is evidence that an accident happened, but it is unclear as to who caused it, it  ought to be presumed that both sides contributed to it, on equal basis. They rely on Hussein Omar Farah vs. Lento Agencies [2016] eKLR (Omolo, Tunoi & Githinji, J), Commercial Transporters Limited vs. Registered Trustees of the Catholic Arch-Diocese of Mombasa [2015] eKLR (Aburili, J), Masembe vs. Sugar Corporation & another [2002] 2 EA 434 and ZOS & CAO (suing as the legal representative in the estate of SAO (Deceased) vs. Amollo Stephen [2019] eKLR (Aburili, J).






9.
On pain and suffering, they submit that the award of Kshs. 200,000.00 was justified as the deceased was hospitalised for a while, and they rely on Margaret Wanjiru Wanjiri & another vs. Isaac Thumbi Gitau & 2 others [2017] eKLR (JN Mulwa, J). They support the award of Kshs. 150,000.00, and cite Joseph Gatone Karanja vs. John Okumu Soita & Esther Chepkorir (suing as admin of the estate of Benard Soita Nyongesa (DCD) [2022] eKLR (Ogola, J), where an award of Kshs. 150,000.00 was made for a 34-year old. They equally support the multiplier adopted by the court, but cite no authority.






10.
On liability, it will be noted that the deceased person, on whose behalf the suit was brought, died after the accident, and before the suit was heard. He was not available to tell his side of the story. The respondents did not provide an eyewitness, to recount to the court on what transpired. One of them, the 1
st
 respondent, testified as PW1. She did not witness the accident, and said she did not know who was to blame. She called PW2, a police officer, who produced the police abstract report. She stated that the matter was still under investigation. DW1 testified for the appellant. He was the driver of the accident vehicle. He said that his motor vehicle was stationary, when the deceased walked to the side of the vehicle, and hit its side mirror, and fell to the ground, got up and walked away. He stated that individuals who were around asked DW1 not to leave the scene, and officers from the Kenya Defence Forces arrived.






11.
The accident was conceded by the appellant. There was an incident which involved the deceased and a vehicle belonging to the appellant. There was police evidence of it, no doubt based on the reports made by the parties. The only issue is on negligence. Who was liable for it? The duty was on the respondents, by dint of sections 107 and 108 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80, Laws of Kenya, to establish that that incident was wholly or partially caused by the appellant or his driver. The evidence presented by them fell short of that, for nothing was adduced on what exactly happened. However, the appellant led evidence, which partially filled the gap. The appellant was not obliged to lead any evidence, on account of the inadequate evidence led by the respondents, for the evidential burden had not shifted to him. The trial court did not shift the burden to him. He, of his own volition, chose to lead or adduce evidence, which shed light on what might have happened. The testimony by DW1 placed the deceased at the scene, and brought him into contact with the accident vehicle. He alleged that his vehicle was stationary, when the deceased came into contact with it, and that whatever injuries he sustained arose from a fall as a result. The trial court disbelieved that narrative, upon taking into account the fact that the deceased suffered fatal injuries.






12.
The case would have been fairly straightforward, had DW1 not testified. There would have been nothing upon which the trial court could have assessed liability. As indicated above, the appellant was not obliged to lead evidence on what transpired, but he chose to. The testimony was illuminating. It established that a collision happened. The narrative was no doubt incredible, that a staggering drunk individual would knock himself so badly on a stationary vehicle, as to suffer fatal injuries. The trial court was justified, in disbelieving the testimony, and in concluding that there must have been a violent collision between the deceased and a fast moving vehicle, bad enough to cause fatal injuries.






13.
I agree with the respondents, that where there is evidence of a collision, but there is inadequate evidence of how the collision occurred, the way to go is not to excuse everyone of liability, for one or both parties must have contributed to the collision. The way out is to hold both parties liable for the collision. That principle, stated in a plethora of cases, among them those cited by the respondents, and others, such as Lakhamshi vs. Attorney General [1971] EA 118 (Spry VP, Lutta & Mustafa, JJA), Domitila Wangui Karugu & another vs. Dagu Hidris Haide [2020] eKLR (Majanja, J), Amani Kazungu Karema vs. Jackmash Auto Ltd & another [2021] eKLR (Nyakundi, J) and Ndatho vs. Chebet [2022] KEHC 346 (KLR)(Gitari, J), would apply here. A collision happened between the deceased and the vehicle belonging to the appellant, something conceded by the appellant in his defence, and in the evidence adduced. The explanation by the defence witness of what transpired was simply out of this world, hence the court disbelieved it. That left no option, but to conclude that both parties were equally to blame for it.






14.
On loss of expectation of life, the trial court awarded Kshs. 150,000.00. The appellant argues his appeal on the basis that the trial court had made an award of Kshs. 200,000.00, which is erroneous. Whatever the case, the question is whether the award of Kshs. 150,000.00 was excessive. The appellant argues that whatever was awarded was excessive, and the trial court ought to have awarded Kshs. 100,000.00 instead. The award for loss of expectation of life is more of a standard figure, which is not subject to assessment as such. Kshs. 100,000.00 is considered to be the conventional figure currently, but nothing stops the court, in exercise of its discretion, from considering a higher figure. See Commercial Transporters Limited vs. Dorcas Adoyo Owiti & another [2017] eKLR (PJ Otieno, J). In the circumstances, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in picking on the figure of Kshs. 150,000.00, rather than apply the conventional Kshs.100,000.00 .






15.
On the award for pain and suffering, of Kshs. 100,000.00, the appellant argues that it is on the higher side, and urges for Kshs. 50,000.00. Kshs. 100,000.00 is considered to be the current or conventional figure, unless the deceased died instantaneously, or shortly thereafter. In this case, the deceased did not die on the spot, or instantaneously, but after a stint of hospitalisation. He must have endured some measure of pain and suffering in that interim period. The award of Kshs. 100,000.00 would be defensible.






16.
On the multiplier, the submission is that the figure adopted, of 30 years, was on the higher side, given that the deceased died at 27 years. A more realistic figure, it is argued, should be 20, upon taking into account the vagaries and uncertainties of life. The multiplier is about the length of time that the deceased would have continued working had he not died at the accident. What would be considered would be the actual age of the deceased, against the average mortality rate in the country and the age of retirement, for the sort of engagement the deceased was in. The so-called vagaries and vicissitudes of life are then brought to bear on these. The retirement age in Kenya is 60 years. The average mortality rate varies from time to time. The court works out the multiplier from a consideration of these factors. There is no scientific way of working out the multiplier, and the courts rely on past decisions as a guide. Let me do so, for a deceased person aged 27, at the time of his death.






17.
In Ngotho Gachanja & another vs. Mary Wangui Wanyoike (suing as the legal representative of the estate of Gerald Ithagu) [2020] eKLR (Ng’etich, J), the court applied a multiplier of 28 for a 22-year-old deceased person. 30 was adopted as the multiplier, where the deceased died at 21 years, in Muthike Muciimi Nyaga (Suing as Administrator of the Estate of James Githinji Muthike (Deceased)) vs. Dubai Superhardware[2021] eKLR (JN Mulwa, J). In Petronila Muli vs. Richard Muindi Savi & Catherine Mwende Mwindu [2021] eKLR (Limo, J), the court adopted 20 years for a 19-year-old. 27 years was adopted, in Retco East Africa Limited vs. Josephine Kwamboka Nyachaki & another [2021] eKLR (Maina, J), for a 23 year-old. In Mosonik & another vs. Cheruiyot (Suing as the Legal Administrator of the Estate of Stanley Kipchumba Kemboi, Deceased) [2022] KEHC 11823 (KLR) (Sewe, J), a multiplier of 37 was adopted for a deceased person aged 23, while Mutinda (Deceased) vs. Maraga t/a Mwamasaburi Hydrotech Services & another [2023] KEHC (JN Mulwa, J) adopted a multiplier of 30, for a 28 year-old.






18.
The survey above reveals a very wide variation on the multiplier adopted for persons who die in their 20s. They range from 20 for a 19-year-old to 37 for a 23-year-old. It would appear that the multiplier adopted by the trial court herein is closer to that used in Mutinda (Deceased) vs. Maraga t/a Mwamasaburi Hydrotech Services & another [2023] KEHC (JN Mulwa, J), where the deceased was 28 years old, and the court adopted a multiplier of 30. I doubt, from the above review, whether there is a uniform way of arriving at a proper multiplier. I hold the view that the multiplier approach does not do justice, in the end, given these very wide variations. Perhaps, the global award or lumpsum approach would be more appropriate, as was suggested in Mwanzia Ngalali Mutua vs. Kenya Bus Services (Msa) Ltd (Ringera, J), cited in Albert Odawa vs. Gichimu Gichenji [2007] eKLR (Koome, J). Anyhow, adoption of a multiplier is at the discretion of the court. That adopted by the trial court appears to be within range, going by Ngotho Gachanja & another vs. Mary Wangui Wanyoike (suing as the legal representative of the estate of Gerald Ithagu) [2020] eKLR (Ng’etich, J), Muthike Muciimi Nyaga (Suing as Administrator of the Estate of James Githinji Muthike (Deceased)) vs. Dubai Superhardware[2021] eKLR (JN Mulwa, J), Petronila Muli vs. Richard Muindi Savi & Catherine Mwende Mwindu [2021] eKLR (Limo, J) and Mutinda (Deceased) vs. Maraga t/a Mwamasaburi Hydrotech Services & another [2023] KEHC (JN Mulwa, J), and I find no basis for interfering with it.






19.
In the end, I find no merit in the appeal, and I hereby disallow it. The effect shall be that the appeal herein is hereby dismissed. Each party shall bear their own costs.

          (An appeal arising from orders in the ruling of Hon. AN Makau, Principal Magistrate, PM, delivered on 14th July 2022, in Milimani CMCCC No. E4068 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit at the primary court was initiated by the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, against the appellant, and the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, for a permanent injunction to restrain the 4
th
 and 5
th
 respondents from disposing of Nairobi/Block 76/54 by public auction, private treaty or otherwise. The case, by the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, was that the 3
rd
 respondent was the registered owner of Nairobi/Block 76/54 , who had a history of memory lapses, and who had been induced or taken advantage of by the 6
th
 respondent to guarantee a loan, in respect of which the 4
th
 and 5
th
 respondents had initiated recovery proceedings, by way of disposal of the property, Nairobi/Block 76/54, without issuing the appropriate notices on the 3
rd
 respondent. The 4
th
 and 5
th
 respondents filed a defence to the claim, where they denied all the facts averred in the plaint, and put the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents to strict proof.






2.
The plaint, initiating the suit, was lodged simultaneously with a Motion, dated 9
th
 August 2020, seeking a temporary injunction, along the same lines as those in the plaint for the order for permanent injunction. Part of the argument was that Nairobi/Block 76/54 was matrimonial property, in respect of which the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents, being sons of the 3
rd
 respondent, had an inherent and constitutional right. The 4
th
 and 5
th
 respondents reacted by stating that the property had already been sold at a public auction, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents had no locus standi to seek the injunction orders and the material pleaded in the supporting affidavit was all hearsay. That application was canvassed by way of written submissions, and was disposed of in a ruling delivered on 19
th
 August 2021, granting the temporary injunctive orders.






3.
The appeal herein does not arise from those orders, but from subsequent orders, made on 14
th
 July 2022, on an application dated 4
th
 February 2022. The latter application was by the appellant herein, seeking his joinder as a defendant in the suit, on grounds that he had paid the purchase price for Nairobi/Block 76/54, which was sold by public auction by 5
th
 respondent herein, on instructions from the 4
th
 respondent. He had argued that he had conducted a search, and established that there was no caveat. He asserted that he was an innocent purchaser without notice. He averred that the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents had concealed pertinent facts, and expressed that his joinder would assist the court to effectively and completely adjudicate the matter. To that application, a preliminary objection was raised, to the effect that the matter was res judicata, as the issue had been determined by the court in the earlier ruling, there was no cause of action between the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents and the appellant, the court had no jurisdiction to address the issue of registration of Nairobi/Block 76/54, and the application was untenable in law. The 1
st
 respondent then swore an affidavit, on 16
th
 March 2022, to expound on or argue the preliminary objection.






4.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. In the ruling, delivered on 14
th
 July 2022, the trial court dismissed the application for joinder, on grounds that the interest that the appellant sought to protect was acquired during the pendency of the suit, after he bought the subject property, and that the relationship between the appellant and the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents was unknown.






5.
The appellant was aggrieved by that ruling, and filed the instant appeal. The grounds of appeal revolve around the trial court holding that no sufficient interest had been established for joinder of the appellant; failure to note and hold that having purchased the property established a sufficient interest; and the failure to consider that the appellant stood to suffer loss, on account of the non-joinder.






6.
Directions were given, on 28
th
 September 2023, for disposal of the appeal, by way of written submissions. I have only come across written submissions by the appellant, in the file of papers that was placed before me.






7.
The appellant cites both Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules and 
the Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules. He has also cited the decisions in Prayash Ventures Limited & 2 others vs. NIC Bank PLC Formerly NIC Bank Limited & another: Beatrice Jeruto Kipketer (Interested Party) [2021] eKLR (HA Omondi, J), Communications Commission of Kenya & 4 others vs. Royal Media Services Limited & 7 others [2014] eKLR (Ojwang & Wanjala, SCJJ) and Mumo vs. Republic [2004] 1 EA 124, to support his case.






8.
From the outset, let me clarify that 
the Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules, often referred to as the Mutunga Rules, do not apply here, for they are the subsidiary legislation for constitutional litigation on protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The litigation before the trial court was not on such issues. The suit was in respect of an ordinary civil dispute, over a loan and land. It fell squarely within the processes prescribed and regulated by the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Cap 21, Laws of Kenya, and the Rules made under that Act, to wit the Civil Procedure Rules. I shall decide the instant appeal on the basis of the Civil Procedure Rules, and not 
the Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules. 
The Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules do not apply universally, to all litigation before the courts, it is specific to constitutional litigation, it can only be cited to help expound on the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules, to the extent that the latter provisions, and those of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, may allow. 
The Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules do not override the Civil Procedure Rules, given that the 2 sets of subsidiary legislation are designed to govern different processes.






9.
Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules, on which the joinder application was premised, states as follows:
“
The court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the court to be just order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out, and that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the court may be necessary in order to enable the court effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit, be added.”






10.
There are 2 objectives in Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules, the striking out or removal of parties from a suit, and joinder or addition of parties. Removal and striking out is for parties who have been improperly joined. The joinder or addition of parties is for parties who ought to have been joined to the suit. The application before the trial court was not seeking striking out of a party who had been improperly joined, but rather addition or joinder of a party whose presence would enable the trial court to effectually and completely adjudicate and settle the questions involved in the suit. There are 2 components to the joinder of parties. The first is about the party or “person who ought to have been joined,” and the second is about a party who need not be joined, but whose presence in the suit is deemed necessary, nevertheless, to shed some light on some element of the matter. Let me deal with the 2 aspects here below.






11.
The first aspect, of a party who ought to have been joined, relates to a party who is directly affected, and who ought to have been made a party to the suit, in view of the cause of action. It is essentially about a person who ought to be party to that suit, in view of the causation, for the orders to be made would directly affect them, in terms of liability, compliance and enforcement, and in respect of whom the proceedings ought not be conducted in their absence, for among other things, the issue of a right to a fair hearing, and to obviate the prospect of that person being condemned unheard. The matter of a primary party ought to come to mind. About a person to whom liability would attach, or against whom the orders would be enforced. For plaintiffs, it would be a person who would be privy to the events leading to the accrual of the cause of action, and who would benefit directly from the orders likely to be made by the court, should the suit prove successful. See King’ori vs. Chege [2002] 2 KLR (Nambuye, J) and Gladys Nduku Nthuki vs. Letshego Kenya Limited & another [2022] eKLR (Odunga, J).






12.
The second aspect is about persons who could be described as secondary parties. That is persons who are not likely to be directly affected by the final orders likely to be made, but whose input in the dispute could assist the court in the determination of the dispute before the court. They would be persons against who no liability attaches, or against whom no orders are likely to be made. They could be affected indirectly by the orders, and, therefore, they should have some interest in the matter, and more importantly, they should have information and knowledge, regarding the subject-matter, which would be essential or necessary for determination of the questions in dispute. The picture of a nominal party should come to mind.






13.
The next question should be whether the appellant herein was a person who could be joined under the first component, or under the second. Whether his joinder was necessary in the first aspect would depend on whether he was a primary party to the matter in controversy, to require that he should have been made a party to the suit at inception, on grounds that liability would attach on him, or orders are likely to be made against him, or he would be required to comply with the orders that the trial court was ultimately likely to make.






14.
Was the appellant such a person? I do not think so. I am not able to tell, directly, from the filings at the trial court, as to when the pleadings were lodged at the court registry, for they bear no court stamps. However, the plaint is dated 9
th
 August 2020, and so is the certificate of urgency, filed simultaneously with it, and the Motion of even date. The handwritten notes in the trial court record indicates that the file was first acted upon by the court on 24
th
 September 2020, and the matter was first placed before a judicial officer, AN Makau, PM, on 13
th
 October 2020. The plaint that was lodged in court sought a permanent injunction, to restrain sale of Nairobi/Block 76/54, and the background was that a loan had been advanced to one of the plaintiffs, in a manner that suggested that he was taken advantage of, and there was an issue of failure to settle the loan, which led to certain steps being taken towards realisation of the property that had been offered as security. The appellant was not party to the loan arrangements, and the property had not been sold to him as at the time the suit was filed. As indicated above, the suit was filed in August/September 2020, and the sale happened in December 2020. As at the time the suit was filed, the appellant was not in the picture, and he did not get into that picture until 11
th
 December 2020, some 3 to 4 months later. He was not privy to the issue that gave rise to the cause of action, he had no information or knowledge of the subject-matter surrounding the loaning and the charging of the property, no liability could accrue to him, and no adverse orders could be made requiring him to comply. He was not a “person who ought to have been joined” at the time the suit was filed, or at inception, and, therefore, he could not be joined or added to the suit on that account.






15.
What about the second aspect, could he be joined on account of that? That is, on account of what he may have known about the subject-matter, which information or knowledge would assist the court in arriving at a fair and just decision, without attributing any liability to him, or making orders that would expect or call for compliance from him. As indicated above, as at the time the suit herein was being filed, the appellant had no interest in the subject-matter, Nairobi/Block 76/54. He was not privy to the loan arrangements where Nairobi/Block 76/54 was offered as security. He, therefore, had no input into the matter, in terms of availing or furnishing information to, or sharing knowledge with, the court, about the dispute that there was between the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, on one part, and the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, on the other. The 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents had come to court to prevent sale of Nairobi/Block 76/54, by the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents. The application for interim injunction was first placed before the court on 13
th
 October 2020, and no interim or temporary orders were granted until 19
th
 March 2021. Although the Advocate for the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, Mr. Mageto, and the court, did talk about interim orders being extended, on 22
nd
 October 2020, there were no such interim orders, for none had been granted on 13
th
 October 2020. The 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents replied to the interlocutory injunction application, by an affidavit sworn on 15
th
 December 2020, and to the plaint, by a defence of even date, and that was after the alleged sale had had happened on 11
th
 December 2020. The payment was allegedly paid or received on 15
th
 December 2020.






16.
As can be seen from the above, the sale allegedly happened during the pendency of the suit. Can it be said that the said sale was carried out with a view to defeat the suit, and specifically the application for interim injunction? If the sale was conducted while the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents were aware of the suit and the application, it would be fair to conclude that the said sale was conducted mischievously, with an intention to steal a march over the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, to defeat the said application. Had the summons to enter appearance, together with the application, been served on the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, by 11
th
 December 2020, when the alleged sale happened? I cannot tell that from the record. I have scrupulously perused and pored through the papers in the original trial record, and the bundle of papers, constituting the record of appeal, filed herein, and I have not come across an affidavit of service, which would have indicated when the plaint and the application were served on the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents. I have noted, from the record, that when the matter came up in court on 22
nd
 October 2020, the Advocate who appeared in the matter for the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, Mr. Mageto, in the absence of the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, informed the court that the said the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents had not filed a response, and that he had been informed by the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents that the parties were negotiating. That implied that service had been effected on the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, as at that date, but they had not filed their responses to the suit and the application. Should any implication be made on the statement by Mr. Mageto, that service had been effected, but the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents had failed to file responses? No. A court of law should not act on suppositions, or on statements made by Advocates at the Bar, but on concrete proof, that, indeed, service had been effected. As there was no proof, by way of an affidavit of service, then, that service had not been effected. No proof of service was subsequently availed, for no affidavit of service, to that effect, was filed prior to delivery of the ruling on 19
th
 March 2021, nor that of 14
th
 July 2022.






17.
In view of the above, it was erroneous of the trial court, in the impugned ruling of 14
th
 July 2022, to have concluded that the property was sold when there were pending issues, when that court did not have before it evidence that the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents were aware of the suit and the application. It could not be said, therefore, that the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents disposed of the matter maliciously to defeat the suit or the application, or while well aware that there were issues that were in court, and they should have held off the sale, even in the absence of the restraining orders.






18.
So, what should be made of this? As indicated above, as at the time the suit was initiated, the appellant herein was not in the picture, for he was yet to purport to have bought the property at a public auction. He could not qualify, therefore, to be a “person who ought to have been joined.” However, after the suit and application for interim injunction were filed, the papers were not served on the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, for there is no proof of that service, and it would be safe to conclude that as at 11
th
 December 2020, when the appellant placed his bid at the public auction, the said 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents were unaware of the said suit. By the very act of bidding at that sale, and of making payment, for the suit property, the appellant acquired an interest that he was entitled to protect, and it entitled him to or justified his joinder as a defendant in the suit, for the same was about a property he had just paid for, and in respect of which he stood to lose, should the matter go on to hearing, and to finalisation, without his involvement. He became a “person who ought to have been joined” at that point.






19.
I note that the purchase price money was paid on 15
th
 December 2020, which is also when the defence, witness statement and replying affidavit were dated. Should much be read into this? The coincidence is worth raising eyebrows. However, beyond that it should not matter. The sale allegedly happened on 11
th
 December 2020, and not on 15
th
 December 2020. The obligation was on the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, to demonstrate, that when the said sale was happening, service had already been effected, and that the said sale was being done mischievously, to either defeat or subvert the course of justice, something which they failed to do. There could be suspicion that service had been effected long before 11
th
 December 2020, but suspicion alone would not do, the 1
st
 , 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents should have proved service in the manner required by the relevant law.






20.
In view of everything that I have discussed above, I come to the conclusion that the trial court erred, in concluding that the sale happened during the pendency of the suit, for that fact was irrelevant, for what mattered was whether, after the filing of the suit and the application, the 2 processes had been brought to the attention of the relevant defendants in the manner required by the law, and that the activities of 11
th
 December 2020 happened with the information and knowledge that that suit and the application were pending. In the absence of proof of service, there was no basis for laying any blame on the appellant.






21.
The trial court had also reasoned that the relationship between the appellant and the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents was unknown or unestablished, and, therefore, there was no possibility of demonstrating that a cause of action existed as between them. The short response to that argument lies with the decision in Andy Forwarders Services Limited & another vs. Price Waterhouse Coopers Limited & another [2012] eKLR (Musinga, J), where it was remarked that joinder need not have anything to do with a cause of action, but about the presence, of the person to be joined or added to the cause, being necessary to enable the court to effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the matter. That would be the second aspect that I have discussed in paragraphs 
15
 and 
16
, hereabove, and the conclusion here should be that, if the appellant did not qualify to be added under the first aspect, then his case fell under the second aspect, on the basis that he had information and knowledge, accumulated from the exercise that he participated in on 11
th
 December 2020, which he could share with the court, and which justified his joinder as a defendant.






22.
Consequently, I find merit in the appeal herein. I hereby allow it, with the consequence that the orders made in the ruling, delivered on 14
th
 July 2022, are hereby set aside, and substituted with an order, allowing the application, dated 4
th
 December 2021, to have the appellant joined to the suit as a defendant. To facilitate the filing of a defence by him, the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents shall, within 30 days, amend their plaint, accordingly, and serve it upon the appellant, and the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 respondents, who shall have another 30 days to file and serve their respective responses. The Deputy Registrar shall cause the original trial court records to be returned to the trial court for compliance and further directions. Each party shall bear their own costs. Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
Before Court for determination is the preliminary objection raised by the respondent on 19/5/2023. The objection was founded on the grounds that the Court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal since it arises from a suit of vacant possession. That the record of appeal is incurably defective for non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Order 42 rule 13.






2.
Parties filed their respective submissions which I have carefully considered. The appellant argued that the suit had initially been filed as a commercial suit in the Subordinate Court, with one of the prayers seeking interest at compounded commercial rates. Based on this, the appellant chose to pursue an appeal before this Court.






3.
The appellant's Counsel contended that, in line with Article 159(2) of 
the Constitution
, which emphasizes that justice should be administered without undue regard to technicalities, it would be more just to transfer the suit to the appropriate court rather than striking it out if it was determined that it had been improperly filed in the current court. Furthermore, the appellant submitted that the record of appeal was not defective, as a supplementary record containing certified copies of the missing documents can be lodged with leave.






4.
The respondent argued that the plaintiff in the trial court had framed the suit as one for the recovery of rent and vacant possession, with the central issue being whether the respondent had breached a tenancy agreement. The respondent's counsel contended that, given the landlord-tenant relationship between the parties, the High Court lacked jurisdiction over the matter and should therefore be struck out. Counsel emphasized that the Environment and Land Court has exclusive jurisdiction over such disputes.






5.
Additionally, the respondent submitted that the appellant's record of appeal was incomplete, pointing out that it lacked essential documents, including the proceedings and decree from the trial court. Counsel also noted that two years had passed since the appeal was scheduled for hearing, implying that the delay was further reason to question the validity and completeness of the appeal.






6.
I have carefully considered the preliminary objection and the submissions made thereon. The central issue for determination is whether the preliminary objection dated 19/5/2023, is well-founded and meritorious. A preliminary objection was defined in Mukhisa Biscuits Manufacturing Co. Ltd v. West End Distributors Ltd [1969] EA 696, as one consisting pure points of law which when raised as a preliminary point is capable of disposing off the suit. It is argued on the assumption that all facts are correct as pleaded.






7.
In the present case, it was contended that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the appellants appeal. The respondent argued that the Court was not the appropriate forum for resolving the dispute, as the same arose from a landlord-tenant relationship and concerned vacant possession of real property. According to the respondent, such matters fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Environment and Land Court.






8.
It well established that the issue of jurisdiction must be addressed and resolved at the earliest opportunity. If a court lacks jurisdiction, any decision or orders it makes are null and void. Therefore, it is crucial that the question of jurisdiction is settled before the Court proceeds to consider the substantive issues of the case. See the case of Owners of the Motor Vessel ""Lillian S"" v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] KLR 1.






9.
Article 162(2)(b) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010 mandates Parliament to establish courts with the status of the High Court to handle specific types of disputes. It provides: -
“
Parliament shall establish courts with the status of the High Court to hear and determine disputes relating to— (b) the environment and the use and occupation of, and title to, land.”






10.
Section 13 of the Environment & Land Court 
Act No. 19 of 2011
 sets out the jurisdiction of that Court. It provides in part as follows: -
“
The court shall have original and appellate jurisdiction to hear and determine all disputes in accordance with Article 162(2) (b) of 
the Constitution
 and with the provision of this Act or any other law applicable in Kenya relating to environment and land.
(2)
In exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 162 (2), (b) of 
the Constitution
, the court shall have power to hear and determine disputes…
(a)
Relating to environmental planning, and protection, climate issues, conduct planning, title, tenure, boundaries rate, rents, valuation, mining, mineral, and other natural resources;
(b)
Relating to compulsory acquiring of land;
(c)
Relating to land administration and management;
(d)
Relating to public, private and community land and contracts, choses in action or other instruments granting any enforceable interests in land.
(e)
Any other dispute relating to the environment and land.”






11.
In Suzanne Butler & 4 Others v Redhill Investments & Another (2017) eKLR, the court held that: -
“
When faced with a controversy whether a particular case is a dispute about land (which should be litigated at the ELC) or not, the Courts utilize the Pre-dominant Purpose Test: In a transaction involving both a sale of land and other services or goods, jurisdiction lies at the ELC if the transaction is predominantly for land, but the High Court has jurisdiction if the transaction is predominantly for the provision of goods, construction, or works. The Court must first determine whether the pre-dominant purpose of the transaction is the sale of land or construction. Whether the High Court or the ELC has jurisdiction hinges on the predominant purpose of the transaction, that is, whether the contract primarily concerns the sale of land or, in this case, the construction of a townhouse. Ordinarily, the pleadings give the Court sufficient glimpse to examine the transaction to determine whether sale of land or other services was the predominant purpose of the contract. This test accords with what other Courts have done and therefore lends predictability to the issue.""






12.
I have reviewed the record. In the plaint dated 12/2/2020, the lower court was approached for the following orders: -
“
a)
A declaration that the lease agreement dated 19
th
 September,2017 is repudiated by the Defendant’s breach.
b)
Vacant possession
c)
Rent arrears in the sum of Kshs.1,008,375/-, as at end of January 2020.
d)
…”






13.
Clearly, the foregoing shows that the cause of action was the use or occupation of land. Although there were claims about breach of contract, those were periphery. The dominant purpose issue was that of termination of the relationship between a landlord and tenant. There was the issue of recovery of possession of the premises and therefore occupation thereof.






14.
Accordingly, I find that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The preliminary objection is hereby upheld and the appeal is struck out with costs.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
This ruling determines the application dated 21/11/2023. The same was brought under Article 159 of 
the Constitution
, sections 3, 3A and 3B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, sections 7 of the 
Appellate Jurisdiction Act
 and Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the court.






2.
The application sought leave to appeal to appeal out of time and for the extension of time for filing a notice of appeal. That the annexed Notice of Appeal be deemed as properly filed upon payment of the requisite fees.






3.
The application was supported by the grounds set out on the face of it and the affidavit of Client/Applicant sworn on 22/11/2023. The applicant stated that the impugned ruling was delivered on notice and therefore the applicant was not aware of it up until he was proclaimed by the auctioneers vide warrants of attachment. That he applied for proceedings and they were delayed but later supplied to him on 6/11/2023. That he has the intention to pursue the appeal and the respondent has commenced execution of the orders.






4.
The application was contested by the respondent vide his replying affidavit sworn on 28/11/2023. He argued that the applicant had been dishonest with the Court as was present and received the ruling in person, indicating awareness of the decision and deadlines. Additionally, that the Court of Appeal had previously struck out the applicant’s application for incompetence. That the application was res judicata as the issue had already been adjudicated and decided in prior proceedings.






5.
Alongside the affidavit, the respondent filed a preliminary objection on 28/11/2023. It was based on two grounds: first, that the Court was functus officio and second, that the application was res judicata.






6.
Parties canvassed the application by way of written submissions. The applicant submitted that the delay in filing the notice of appeal was not intentional and he was not of the ruling. He urged the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that litigants in person find challenges in accessing the Court registry. Finally, that the respondent would not be highly prejudiced if the orders sought are granted.






7.
The respondent submitted that on 5/5/2023, the Court had dismissed a similar application. That respondent relied wholly on his replying affidavit and preliminary objection.






8.
I have considered the application, the responses and the submissions on record. The first issue to address is whether the preliminary objection raised by the respondent on 28/11/2023 is merited. The preliminary objection challenged the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the Court was functus officio and that the application was res judicata.






9.
In Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Company –vs- West End Distributors Limited [1969] EA, it was held that a preliminary objection consists of a point of law which has been pleaded or which arises by clear implication out of pleadings and which if argued as a preliminary point may dispose of the suit. It is what used to be a demurrer and is argued on the basis that the facts are settled and/or are correct as asserted by the parties.






10.
Black’s Law Dictionary, 10
th
 Edition defines a preliminary objection in the following terms: -
“
… in a case before an international tribunal, an objection that, if upheld, would render further proceedings before the tribunal impossible or unnecessary.”






11.
In Telcom Kenya Ltd –vs- John Ochanda [2014] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held as follows: -
“
Functus Officio is an enduring principle of law that prevents the re-opening of a matter before a Court that rendered the final decision thereon-
The general rule that final decision of a Court cannot be re-opened derives from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in re-St Nazarire Co, (1879), 12 Ch. D88. The basis for it was that the power to rehear was transferred by the Judicature Acts of the appellate division.”






12.
Similarly, in RAILA ODINGA –VS- IEBC & 3 OTHERS Petiti
on No. 5 of 2013
, the Supreme Court of Kenya cited with approval the following passage from “The Origins of the Functus Officio Doctrine with Specific Reference to its Application in Administrative Law” by Daniel Malan Pretorious:-
“
... The functus officio doctrine is one of the mechanisms by means of which the law gives expression to the principle of finality. According to this doctrine, a person who is vested with adjudicative or decision-making powers may, as a general rule, exercise those powers only once in relation to the same matter... The [principle] is that once such a decision has been given, it is (subject to any right of appeal to superior body or functionary) final and conclusive. Such a decision cannot be reviewed or varied by the decision maker.”






13.
From the foregoing, it is clear that a court is considered to be functus officio only if it has fully resolved a matter based on merits. If the court has not yet fully examined and decided a matter on the substance of the case, it can-not be said to be functus officio.  It can still address or change its decisions.






14.
In the present case, the application seeks leave to appeal out of time and an extension of time within which to lodge a notice of appeal. I note that these are just post-judgment orders which the Court has jurisdiction to entertain. The Court retains jurisdiction to address procedural aspects post-judgment and is therefore not precluded from considering the application for leave to appeal out of time.






15.
On resjudicata, the respondent contended that the Court had previously determined an application of a similar nature. Section 7 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, 2010 provides that: -
“
No court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.”






16.
In Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission v Maina Kiai & 5 Others (2017), eKLR the Court of Appeal held that: -
“
… the bar of res judicata to be effectively raised and upheld on account of a former suit, the following elements must be satisfied, as they are rendered not in disjunctive but conjunctive terms;
a)
The suit or issue was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit.
b)
That former suit was between the same parties or parties under whom they or any of them claim.
c)
Those parties were litigating under the same title.
d)
The issue was heard and finally determined in the former suit.
e)
The court that formerly heard and determined the issue was competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which the issue is raised.
...
The rule or doctrine of res judicata serves the salutary aim of bringing finality to litigation and affords parties closure and respite from the spectre of being vexed, haunted and hounded by issues and suits that have already been determined by a competent court. It is designed as a pragmatic and common-sensical protection against wastage of time and resources in an endless round of litigation at the behest of intrepid pleaders hoping, by a multiplicity of suits and fora, to obtain at last, outcomes favourable to themselves. Without it, there would be no end to litigation, and the judicial process would be rendered a noisome nuisance and brought to disrepute and calumny. The foundations of res judicata thus rest in the public interest for swift, sure and certain justice.”






17.
I have reviewed the record in its entirety. I note that the applicant had previously filed an application for stay of execution dated 20/2/2022 and a ruling thereon delivered on 5/5/2023. The issue of stay pending appeal against the decree of this Court has already been determined. The application, in so far as the issue of stay of execution is concerned, is res-judicata. The prayer for stay is therefore res – judicata and therefore fails.






18.
The second issue is whether the prayer for extension of time to file an appeal is justified. In Edith Gichungu Koine Vs Stephen Njagi Thoithi [2014] eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated that: -
“
Nevertheless, it ought to be guided by consideration of factors stated in many previous decisions of this court including, but no limited to, the period of delay, the reasons for the delay, the degree of prejudice to Respondent if the application is granted, and whether the matter raises issues of public importance, amongst others.”






19.
The first question to be answered is whether the applicant has given a satisfactory explanation for the delay in filing the notice of appeal. With respect to the delay, the applicant stated that he was not aware of the ruling of the Court and that therefore, the delay was not intentional. The respondent on the other hand stated that the applicant was in Court when the ruling was read.






20.
I have perused the Court proceedings for 5/5/2023. The record shows that the ruling was read in the presence of all the parties where the applicant appeared in person. The applicant was therefore dishonest in his allegation that he was not aware of the ruling. That alone justifies the dismissal of the application. This lack of honesty undermines the credibility of the applicant’s request for an extension of time. The granting of leave to extend time is undeniably a discretionary remedy which is based on the circumstances of each case.






21.
The record indicates that the applicant filed this application only after his previous application had been dismissed. In my view, the applicant does not merit the orders sought.






22.
In this regard, I find no merit in the application and the same is dismissed with costs.




It is so ordered.

1.
On 23
rd
 August, 2024, the 1
st
 Petitioner filed a Notice of Motion application under Certificate of Urgency alleging the abduction of the 2
nd
 – 4
th
 Petitioners on 19
th
 August, 2024; and that they were subsequently kept incommunicado in undisclosed locations.






2.
This court upon considering the application exparte in the first instance, made orders as follows: -
1.
That pending the hearing and determination of this application interpartes an order is hereby issued directing the Respondents to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the 2nd to 4th Petitioners to the 1st Petitioner.
2.
That pending the hearing and determination of this Application Inter partes an order is hereby issued directing the Respondents to immediately release or produce the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 Petitioners before any Court of competent jurisdiction to make such orders as may be appropriate to uphold the rights and fundamental freedoms of the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 Petitioners.
4.
The matter was then fixed for mention on Monday, 26
th
 August, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. to confirm compliance.






3.
On 26
th
 August, 2024, the Advocate for the Petitioners M/s Omwenga appeared before this Court virtually. There was no appearance by the Respondents despite evidence of service. She informed the Court that even after duly serving the order and directions of the Court upon the Respondents none of orders had been complied with.






4.
The Respondents did not even bother to attend Court on that particular day.






5.
At this juncture, the Court varied its orders slightly and directed thus:
i.
Pending the institution of charges, (if any), the Court now directs unconditional release of 2
nd
 – 4
th
 Petitioners by the 1
st
 Respondent.
ii.
It is further directed that physical service of the order be effected by close of business that day.
iii.
The court further issued summons to the 1
st
 Respondent to appear in court at the next mention to explain why the habeas corpus orders issued by this court had not been complied with. The matter was fixed for Mention on 3
rd
 September, 2024.






6.
Today 3
rd
 September, 2024, this matter was mentioned virtually before Court this morning. The Attorney General, the DPP and the Director of National Intelligence Service, the Inspector General of Police and Directorate of Criminal Investigations appeared through counsel.






7.
However, despite the court having directed the Inspector General of Police to appear, he did not even do so virtually.






8.
The court postponed the matter to 3.00 p.m. for the physical attendance of the Inspector General as it sought to establish why its orders for the production of the three Petitioners have not been complied with.






9.
This afternoon, the Inspector General of Police has equally skipped this afternoon Court session on the basis that he is out of Office on official reasons.






10.
Today in the morning, I inquired when the orders were served, and I was informed that this was done on 26
th
 August, 2024.






11.
The court has not been told when the Inspector General left the Office for official reasons. It has also not been told, why he could not avail himself for the virtual session in the morning which he also skipped.






12.
This matter involves the lives of three Kenyans whose whereabouts are unknown after their alleged abduction in two separate incidents on 19
th
 August, 2024.






13.
Under 
the Constitution
, Article 20(2) – Every person is entitled to enjoy the rights and fundamental freedoms to the greatest extent possible consistent with the nature of the rights and fundamental freedom. Article 20(1) makes it clear that the Bill of Rights applies to all law and binds all state organs and all persons.






14.
From the preliminary assessment of facts, the Petition and the Application raises an issue of grave concern which include the right not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or detained without trial and the freedom of movement hence the issuance of habeas corpus order.






15.
Under Article 21(1), it is the fundamental duty of the state and every state organ to observe respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights. Respecting and observing the Bill of Rights means that the State shall not do anything that is detrimental to the Bill of Rights, while the obligation to protect, promote and fulfil requires the state to take positive measures that would ensure that even other persons or entities do not abuse or violate human rights.






16.
To bring the matter closer home, Article 244 (c) specifically enjoins the National Police Service to comply with constitutional standards of human rights and fundamental freedoms.






17.
In addition, Article under 10 (2) (b) prescribes the national values and principles of governance to be followed by all state organs, state officers and all persons in performance of their responsibilities and includes observance of human rights as part of those obligations.






18.
It is thus crystal clear that if a State Officer or any person does not accord human rights the attention that it deserves while performing their responsibilities, then such a State Officer or person will have failed the constitutional threshold demanded of him or her by our Constitution.






19.
This is a country that is led by the rule of law and constitutionalism not the might of men. The Respondents have no discretion to disregard an order of the Court that is meant to uphold the rule of law by protecting human rights. It is the duty of the 1
st
 respondent to obey the orders of the court and cannot be excused from that responsibility.






20.
Having failed to obey the first two Court orders; the 1
st
 respondent equally failed to obey a 3
rd
 one, that required him to attend this court this afternoon.






21.
This court has teeth and can bite. It will not watch as its authority and constitutionalism slowly whittle away. Those that deliberately ignore or disobey court orders must be ready of the consequences, and for violation of 
the constitution
 even greater consequences.






22.
I am aware that in Abdullah Kassam Esmail v Equip Agencies Ltd & 4 others [2014] eKLR the court stated that before punishing one for contempt, he must be given a hearing first.






23.
I will accord the 1
st
 Respondent that opportunity before spelling out any consequences that the Court may consider necessary.






24.
The court has to assert is authority for maintenance of rule of law especially where deliberate disobedience of its order has been demonstrated.






25.
I am equally aware that the power to punish for contempt must be exercised with great care and circumspection as was held by the Supreme Court in Republic v Ahmad Abolfathi Mohammed & another (2018) eKLR hence the need for a hearing.






26.
I will thus order that the Inspector General of Police shall physically attend court on Thursday, 5
th
 September, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. to purge the contempt before any further proceedings in this matter.






27.
Mention on 5

 September, 2024 at 10.00 a.m.

Judgment










Introduction


1.
The substratum of the dispute in this case is whether the award of compensation issued following the compulsory acquisition of Land Reference No. Mutomo/Mwala/769 measuring 0.1045 hectares (hereinafter the “suit property”) was the sum of Kshs. 1,533,637.00 or the sum of Kshs. 999,120.00. Whereas the Claimant is adamant that it is the former, the Respondents counter that the award of compensation was the latter, and not a coin more.






2.
The parties agree on the background informing this dispute save for the above. Briefly, on 12
th
 January 2018, the National Land Commission (the 1
st
 Respondent/the Commission) through Gazette Notice No. 177 published a notice of the intention to compulsorily acquire, among others, the suit property for the purpose of construction of the Kibwezi-Mutomo-Kitui-Kabati-Migwani (A9/B64) Road Project. In the said notice, the Claimant was identified as the registered proprietor.






3.
Subsequently, on 25
th
 May 2018, the 1
st
 Respondent through Gazette Notice No. 5076 published a notice of inquiry notifying interested persons, including the Claimant, of the intention to hear claims for compensation. The inquiry was to be held at Mutomo Chief’s Office at 9.30 a.m. on 19
th
 June 2018.






4.
The Claimant has not been paid any money until today following the acquisition.








Claimant’s Case


5.
The Claimant avers that on 21
st
 June, 2018 the 1
st
 Respondent issued him with an award of compensation for the sum of KShs. 1,533,637.00 which award the Claimant avers he accepted on even date. The Claimant contends that despite issuance of the aforesaid award as well as formal and informal inquiries on the same, the Claimant is yet to receive any amounts towards compensation.






6.
Consequently, the Claimant contends that as a result of the Respondents’ actions, he has suffered and continues to suffer pecuniary loss and embarrassment for being denied the benefit of the compensation whilst the Respondents profited from the acquisition. The Claimant, therefore, prays for the following:
i.
A Declaration that the Claimant’s proprietary interests in Land Title Number Mutomo/Mwala/769 were compulsorily acquired;
ii.
A Declaration that the Claimant herein is entitled to prompt, just and adequate compensation in full within the meaning and tenor of Article 40(3) (b) (i) in the sum of One Million Five Hundred and Thirty-Three Thousand Six Hundred and Thirty-Seven Shillings (Kshs. 1,533,637/-) for the compulsory acquisition of his proprietary interests in Land Title Number Mutomo/Mwala/769.
iii.
An order directing the Respondents to forthwith pay the compensation award in the sum of One Million Five Hundred and Thirty-Three Thousand Six Hundred and Thirty-Seven Shillings (Kshs. 1,533,637/-) together with the accrued interest at the then prevailing Central Bank base lending rate of 13.00% from 21
st
 June 2018 until payment in full;
iv.
An award of loss of income in the sum of Kshs. 600,000/-
v.
General damages for trespass and mesne profits.
vi.
Costs of the suit plus interest.
vii.
Any other order as this honourable court may deem fit and appropriate.








1
st
 Respondent’s Case


7.
The 1
st
 Respondent, vide its Response dated 8
th
 July, 2024 refuted the claims by the Claimant and averred that the monies meant for compensation of the Claimant’s property had not been remitted to it by the Kenya National Highways Authority (the 2
nd
 Respondent/KENHA), being the acquiring authority, and which failure is the reason behind the failure to pay the Claimant the compensation.






8.
However, in a further response dated 25
th
 July 2024, following leave of this tribunal, the 1
st
 Respondent asserted that the Claimant was issued with an award of Kshs. 999,120.00 as compensation through a payment schedule dated 2
nd
 March 2021. The 1
st
 Respondent also filed a further list of documents dated 1
st
 August 2024 which contains a letter of award dated 12
th
 January 2021 and a letter of acceptance or contestation of even date.








2
nd
 Respondent’s Case


9.
The 2
nd
 Respondent filed a Replying Affidavit of Dr. Anthony Kusimba, sworn on 15
th
 July 2024, in response to the Claim. Dr. Kusimba identifies himself as a Senior Surveyor, Survey Department Directorate of Highways Design and Safety for the 2
nd
 Respondent. He avers that pursuant to the letter dated 2
nd
 March 2021 from the 1
st
 Respondent, the compensation awarded to the Claimant is Kshs. 999,120.00.






10.
Dr. Kusimba further avers that the 2
nd
 Respondent noted the discrepancy between the award letter dated 21
st
 June 2018 and the payment schedule from the 1
st
 Respondent upon which the 2
nd
 Respondent was to effect payment. In effect, it is the 2
nd
 Respondent’s case that the Claimant’s demand for payment of Kshs. 1,533,637/- is contrary to the revision by the 1
st
 Respondent which had advised the 2
nd
 Respondent to pay the Claimant the sum of Kshs. 999,120/-.






11.
In sum, Dr. Kusimba avers that the Claimant will be compensated as soon as the discrepancy is resolved.








Analysis and Determination


12.
When this matter was mentioned for directions on 1
st
 August 2024, parties mutually agreed to have the same disposed of by way of documentary evidence and submissions. All parties have filed submissions identifying issues that the Tribunal should pronounce itself on.






13.
Before we embark on the main issues in the suit, the 2
nd
 Respondent has through its submissions raised an issue that concerns our jurisdiction. We are compelled to address that first. The 2
nd
 Respondent submits that the Tribunal is not properly constituted within the meaning and tenor of Section 133A (2) (sic) of the Land Act which places the quorum of the Tribunal at three members whereas the Tribunal has been sitting with two members.






14.
We are of the view that raising such a pertinent issue at the point of final submissions has an effect on the right to a fair hearing and a court should ordinarily disregard it. However, we have taken the liberty to address it below.






15.
Section 133A (1) of the Land Act states as follows:
133A.
Establishment of the Tribunal.
1.
There is established a Tribunal to be known as the Land Acquisition Tribunal which shall consist of three persons appointed by the Cabinet Secretary through a notice in the Gazette.






16.
There is no provision of the Land Act, or any other law, that provides for the quorum of the Land Acquisition Tribunal. If the legislature had intended to prescribe quorum for the tribunal, nothing could have been easier. Indeed, a number of existing tribunals have their quorums established under law. For instance, the quorum for the Energy Tribunal under Section 33(2) of the Energy Act is set at three members. The Energy tribunal consists of not more than seven members. Likewise, Section 102C of the Kenya Information and Communications Act sets the quorum of the Communication and Multi Media Appeals Tribunal as the Chairperson and four members.






17.
We are not convinced that it was the intention of the legislature that the full membership of the tribunal must be present for the tribunal to be quorate. Such an intention would have been clearly expressed in our establishing law. We are also guided by the sentiments of W.K. Korir, J in Republic V Industrial Property Tribunal Exparte Sanitam Services (EA) Ltd [2012] eKLR where he stated as follows in regard to the Industrial Property Tribunal whose establishing law did not provide for quorum:
The parties are agreed that the Act and the Industrial Tribunal Rules, 2002 do not provide for the quorum of the Tribunal. A plain reading of Section 113(1) of the Act gives the impression that all the five members of the Tribunal have to hear a matter in order for its proceedings to be valid. The Applicant also argues that the chairman has to be present in all the Tribunal’s proceedings. The Tribunal and the Interested Party, however, argue that the said section cannot be interpreted in the manner suggested by the Applicant. In my view, it would be unreasonable to imagine that in the event of one member being absent no case can proceed before the Tribunal. This would be a very narrow interpretation of the law which would not give essence to the intentions of Parliament. Such an interpretation would result in absurd outcomes. I believe that the main objective of creating the Tribunal was to have a body composed of persons knowledgeable in industrial property disputes to hear and dispose of such disputes expeditiously. Emphasis added.






18.
It is our finding, therefore, that the tribunal is properly constituted to hear and determine disputes before it.






19.
Back to the substantive issues, the parties have identified the following issues for resolution:
i.
Whether the Claimant is entitled to compensatory award of Kshs. 1,533,637/-
ii.
Whether the Claimant is entitled to interest at 13.00% from 21
st
 June 2018 until payment in full.
iii.
Whether the Claimant is entitled to loss of income and the general damages sought.
iv.
Costs.






20.
As stated at the beginning, the main issue that must be resolved before other issues are considered is whether the compensation awarded to the Claimant is for the sum of Kshs. 1,533,637/- or for the sum of Kshs. 999,120/-. Issuance of an award comes at the tail end of an acquisition process. Section 113 of the Land Act provides as follows in this regard:
1.
Upon the conclusion of the inquiry, the Commission shall prepare a written award, in which the Commission shall make a separate award of compensation for every person whom the Commission has determined to have an interest in the land.
2.
Subject to Article 40(2) of the Constitution and Section 122 and 128 of this Act, an award—
a.
shall be final and conclusive evidence of—
i.
the size of the land to be acquired;
ii.
the value, in the opinion of the Commission, of the land;
iii.
the amount of the compensation payable, whether the persons interested in the land have or have not appeared at the inquiry; and
b.
shall not be invalidated by reason only of a discrepancy which may thereafter be found to exist between the area specified in the award and the actual area of the land.
3.
If an interest in land is held by two or more persons as co-tenants, the award shall state —
(a)
the amount of compensation awarded in respect of that interest; and
(b)
the shares in which it is payable to those persons.
(4)
Every award shall be filed in the office of the Commission.”






21.
The case of Patrick Musimba vs. National Land Commission & 4 others [2016] eKLRwhich elaborates this process to a great detail provides as follows in regard to issuance of awards:
92.
On completion of the inquiry the National Land Commission makes a separate award of compensation for every person determined to be interested in the land and then offers compensation. The compensation may take either of the two forms prescribed. It could be a monetary award. It could also be land in lieu of the monetary award, if land of equivalent value, is available. Once the award is accepted, it must be promptly paid by the National Land Commission. Where it is not accepted then the payment is to be made into a special compensation account held by the National Land Commission: see Sections 113- 119 of the Land Act.






22.
There is no doubt in our minds that the law intended for each project affected person to be given an individual award. This is necessary so that such a project affected person can exercise the choice of acceptance or rejection. It is necessary at this stage to ask if there was an award of compensation issued and what the amount thereof is.






23.
The Claimant relies on a document titled “valuation for compulsory acquisition” as proof of award issued by the 1
st
 Respondent. The document which is provided as document number 4 in the Claimant’s list and bundle of documents dated 21
st
 June 2024 indicates: the suit property reference, ownership and has a valuation section which tallies the “total compensation payable” to be Kshs. 1,533,637/-. The document does not, however, indicate the author although it has a logo of the 1
st
 Respondent at the top.






24.
The 1
st
 Respondent argues that the document the Claimant relies upon as proof of an award is not an actual letter of award but rather a form filed during inquiries as to the estimated value of the parcel of land to be acquired. This information is provided by the Claimant during enquiries before the Commission embarks on valuation.






25.
The 2
nd
 Respondent submits that pursuant to Section 113(2)(a) of the Land Act, any person who seeks to enforce payment within the meaning of Article 40(3)(b) of the Constitution must sufficiently prove the existence of a valid award from which their right to payment arises. The 2
nd
 Respondent therefore submits that a claim based on an award in a valuation form fails to meet the aforementioned threshold and therefore fails.






26.
Our reading of Section 113 of the Land Act is that an award must be issued by the 1
st
 Respondent and it must be clear that it is an award. Although the document presented in evidence by the Claimant as an award contains the 1
st
 Respondent’s logo, the same does not indicate its origin or author. The said document does not state that it is an award of compensation.






27.
On the other hand, the 1
st
 Respondent, through its further list and bundle of documents dated 1
st
 August 2024, filed a document titled “award” which indicates an award of Kshs. 999,120/- in favour of the Claimant. This document was issued by one Isabel Njeru – Directorate of Valuation & Taxation on behalf of the Chairperson of the 1
st
 Respondent on 12
th
 January 2021. The 1
st
 Respondent further filed another document which is indicated to be an “acceptance or contestation of award” of even date. This document, on the face of it, indicates that the Claimant accepted the award by appending his signature thereto accepting the award of Kshs. 999,120/-.






28.
The Claimant did not contest the validity of these documents.






29.
We, therefore, find that the Claimant was given an award of compensation for the sum of Kshs. 999,120/- and the award was accepted on 12
th
 January 2021. Having accepted the said award, the Claimant is entitled to be compensated the sum of Kshs. 999,120/- as he did not contest the same. A party who is dissatisfied with an award given by the 1
st
 Respondent has a right to appeal the same but must indicate that he or she contests the award given at the time the same is issued to such a party. The Claimant did not choose this route.






30.
The sum of our analysis is that the Claimant was awarded compensation for the sum of Kshs. 999,120/- on 12
th
 January 2021which he accepted. By accepting the said award, the Claimant entered into a legally enforceable contract with the 1
st
 Respondent. The Claimant cannot turn around and contest the awarded compensation by presenting another figure purporting to be the award. Having failed to contest the awarded sum, the only recourse available to the Claimant is to lodge a complaint to the effect that the 1
st
 Respondent has not paid the awarded compensation.






31.
Having said that, it is not clear to us why the awarded compensation has not been paid. We note that via letter dated 2
nd
 March 2021 (which has been availed in evidence by the 2
nd
 Respondent), the 1
st
 Respondent advised the 2
nd
 Respondent to make payments to project affected persons who had accepted their awards and were contained in a schedule thereof. In this schedule, the 1
st
 Respondent identifies the Claimant, among others, as one of those who had accepted their awards. Whereas the 1
st
 Respondent may delegate the payment of compensation sums from the acquiring authority directly to the project affected persons, the 1
st
 Respondent bears the statutory responsibility for effecting such payments. Indeed, Section 111A requires the acquiring authority to deposit compensation funds with the 1
st
 Respondent “before the acquisition is undertaken.” As this Tribunal has held in Thuo & 151 others v National Land Commission & 5 others (Land Acquisition Petition 3 of 2024) [2024] KELAT 1142 (KLR) (12 August 2024) (Judgment), this requirement, “flows from the Constitutional imperative under Article 40(3) to ensure that compensation is promptly done.”
1
1
Para. 58.






32.
In regard to whether the Claimant is entitled to interest as from 21
st
 June 2018, the 1
st
 Respondent contends that it has not received the compensation funds from the 2
nd
 Respondent and hence the same has not been deposited in a special account. The 2
nd
 Respondent on its part argues that the Claimant has not satisfied the preconditions under Section 115(1) of the Land Act in order to claim interest under Section 117(1) Act of the Land Act.






33.
We are persuaded by the 2
nd
 Respondent’s interpretation of Section 117(1) to the extent that the same cannot be read in isolation but must be read together with Section 115(1) of the Land Act which lays down circumstances where compensation is not paid and hence justify the payment of interest when the compensation funds are deposited in a special account. Those circumstances are where there is no person competent to receive payment; the person entitled does not consent to receive the amount awarded; or, there is a dispute as to the right of the persons entitled to receive the compensation or as to the shares in which the compensation is to be paid. We, therefore, hold that the Claimant is not entitled to interest pursuant to Section 117(1) of the Land Act as his case does not fall under any of the circumstances under Section 115(1) of the Land Act.






34.
On whether the Claimant is entitled to loss of income and general damages, the same is not justified in addition to the award of compensation issued. An award of compensation is a final determination of what is due and owing to a project affected person. In arriving at such an award, the 1
st
 Respondent takes into account all factors necessary for compensation and if a project affected person is not satisfied then an appeal lies from that award.






35.
In conclusion, the Claimant’s primary case fails. We, however, must note that the 1
st
 Respondent has not paid the compensation contained in the award dated 12
th
 January 2021 to the Claimant. This is an inordinate delay and a clear violation of the Claimant’s rights under Article 40(3) of the Constitution and Section 115(1) of the Land Act. While the Claimant was “confused” on the amount of compensation payable, the Respondents did not have that confusion and ought to have paid promptly. We, therefore, order that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for the sum of Kshs. 999,120/- which shall be paid on or before the expiry of 21 days from the date hereof. He shall also be entitled to interest at court rates from 2
nd
 March 2021 until payment in full. Parties shall bear their own costs.






36.
Orders accordingly.

          (Being an appeal from the ruling of the Honourable Magistrate J.R.NDURURI (P.M) delivered on 2nd March 2023 and in Kakamega SUCC.NO.195 OF 2020)
        
      






Ruling










1.
What comes up for determination is the Application dated 21/7/2023 seeking for following orders:
a).
Spent.
b).
That the Honourable court be pleased to stay the execution of the Ruling and Confirmation of Grant delivered on 2/3/23 and the Confirmation of Grant confirmed on 4/7/2023 and all consequential orders pending the hearing and determination of the Application inter partes.
c).
That the honourable court be pleased to stay the execution of the Ruling and Confirmation of Grant of the honourable court delivered on 2nd March 2023, and Confirmation of Grant confirmed on the 4th day of July 2023 and all consequential orders pending the hearing and determination of the Appeal.






The Applicant’s case


2.
The Applicant’s case is that he is aggrieved by the ruling of the court delivered on 2/3/2023 and order of 4/7/2023 and he’s filed an Appeal against the aforesaid decisions.






3.
That unless stay is granted he will suffer irreparable loss; that the ruling was delivered in his absence, that he has an arguable appeal with high chances of success; and that he is ready to comply with any conditions that this Court may set.








The Respondents’ Case


4.
It is the Respondents’ case that contrary to the Applicant’s allegations, the Applicant has always been present in Court; that the provisions on liabilities were valid and that, in any event the Applicant got the largest share of the Asset of the Estate.






5.
The Application was canvassed by way of written submission.








Application’s Submissions


6.
The Applicant reiterates the facts in the Affidavit and states that his share of the land was reduced to accommodate liabilities, notwithstanding that he had no responsibility to bear the said liability. He further points out that land parcel No. South Kabras/Chesero/2704 was not included in the assets of the Esates; that the signature appearing on the consent for distribution were forgeries.






7.
In view of the aforegoing, he submits, the Appeal has high chances of success.








Respondent’s Submissions


8.
It is the Respondent’s submission that the Applicant has not brought forth any evidence to demonstrate that he will suffer substantial loss if the order of stay is not granted; that merely stating that he will suffer substantial loss is not sufficient. That in any event, there was no affidavit of protest filed to the distribution of the Estate by the Applicant.






9.
It is further submitted that the Applicant does not deny that the liabilities of the Estate that he has referred t. o were valid .






10.
It is finally submitted that that it has not been demonstrated that the Appeal would be rendered nugatory if stay is not granted.








Determination


11.
The conditions upon which a court may grant stay are well-settled. Order 42 Rule 6 makes a requires the Applicant to demonstrate that substantial loss may result unless the order of stay is made; that the Application has been made without undue delay and that such security as as the court orders for the due performance of the decree has been offered by the Applicant.






12.
The other requirements are that the Applicant must show that the Appeal would be rendered nugatory , and that the Appeal has high chance of success.






13.
It is an undisputed fact that the Application herein has been brought without any delay. The grant arising from the ruling was issued on 4/7/2023 while the present Application was filed on 24/7/2023. There was no delay therefore.






14.
On whether the Appeal will be rendered nugatory, I have noted that the orders being appealed against touch on the distribution of the deceased’s properties, some to persons who are described as liabilities. If the Appeal was to succeed the reversal of the lower court’s orders may entail the taking away of the rights of 3rd parties, who would have purchased the property. It will also entail unnecessary costs and inconveniences to the affected parties. In my view some of the losses that may result cannot be compensated by costs, unlike money decrees.






15.
It must be remembered that the main purpose of stay pending appeal is to preserve the subject matter of a suit. In the case of RWW v EKW [2019] eKLR, the court held: “The purpose of an Application for stay of execution pending Appeal is to preserve the subject matter in dispute so that the rights of appellant who is exercising the undoubted right of Appeal are safeguarded and the Appeal, if successful is not rendered nugatory . However , in so doing, the court should weigh this Right against the success of a litigant who should not be deprived of the fruits of his or her judgment . The court is also called upon to ensure that no party suffers prejudice that cannot be compensated by costs.”






16.
On whether the Appeal is arguable with high chances of success, I have perused the Memorandum of Appeal. The Applicant is raising, among other things, the inclusion of undeserving liabilities and inclusion of non-deserving ones, non-participation by the beneficiaries, the actual acreage of the property distributed and exclusion of land parcel No. S/Kabras/Chesero/2704, from the assets of the Estate.






17.
In order not to jeopardise the Appeal, I would not venture into the merits and demerits of the above allegations. However, in my view, they are arguable issues. The Appellant should therefore be allowed to ventilate the same on Appeal.






18.
The Applicant has submitted that it is ready to comply with such orders as this court may direct. I have pointed out that this is not a money decree and the value of the property is not ascertainable unless a valuation of the land is carried out. Getting a land valuer to go and value the property will be costly in terms of time lost and the valuation fees. In the circumstances of this case , I find that security need not be provided.






19.
In conclusion, the Application is warranted, I hereby make the following orders:
a).
Pending the hearing and determination of the Appeal herein, there shall be a stay of execution of the lower court judgement delivered on 2/3/2023 and the implementation of the Certificate of Confirmation of Grant issued on 4/7/2023 and/or all consequential orders in Kakamega Chief Magistrates Court SCC No. 195 of 2020.
b).
Each party to meet their own costs.

          (Appeal from judgment and decree of Hon. Muholi, Senior Principal Magistrate, SPM, in Milimani CMCCC No. 3273 of 2017, of 4th March 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant had been sued by the respondent, at the primary court, for compensation, for material loss arising out of a road traffic accident on 22
nd
 September 2014, along Elgeyo Marakwet Road. The case by the respondent was that her motor vehicle, registration mark and number KBK 605N, was involved in an accident, with another, said to have belonged to the appellant, being registration mark and number KAS 469P, causing extensive damage to motor vehicle KBK 605N, and liability was attributed on the appellant on account of negligence. The appellant filed a defence, admitting the accident, but denying everything else pleaded in the plaint, and, in the alternative pleading contribution on the part of the respondent or her driver.






2.
A trial was conducted. 3 witnesses testified for the respondent, while none testified for the appellant. Judgment was delivered on 15
th
 September 2022. On liability, the court held the appellant 100% liable. On quantum, the court awarded Kshs. 233,500.00 special damages.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The appeal has raised 3 grounds, revolving around liability and quantum.






4.
On 20
th
 December 2023, directions were given, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. It would appear that only the appellant filed written submissions, for those are the only submissions that I see in the record before me. The appellant has argued on only 2 grounds: liability and quantum.






5.
On liability, he submits that the respondent did not prove that he was 100% liable for the accident. He submits that a sketch plan, indicating a point of impact, was not produced, and that the respondent was only relying on a police abstract report which blamed him for the accident, yet that of itself was not enough. He cites Mwema Musyoka vs. Paulstone Shamwamam Shell [2020] eKLR (JN Mulwa, J), Fal Azad & another vs. Peter Mubua Karanja & 2 others [2016] eKLR (JN Mulwa, J) and Benter Atieno Obonyo vs. Anne Nganga & another [2021] eKLR (Chemitei, J). He submits that the trial court ought to have found both drivers liable on a 50:50 basis.






6.
On quantum, he submits that the claim for hire of a taxi for Kshs. 90,000.00 was not proved, as no receipts were produced to support the claim. He further argues that that alleged loss of user was not pleaded, and, therefore, the court decided on a special damage that was neither pleaded nor proved. He avers the amount of Kshs. 90,000.00 ought to have been excluded.






7.
On liability, the respondent testified that she was a passenger in her car, when the accident happened. She stated that her car was at the junction of Ngong Road and Marakwet Road, when a woman, driving the appellant’s car, rammed into her car, on its left side. PW2 was a police officer, who produced a police abstract report and an abstract from the relevant police occurrence book. He did not investigate the accident, but, based on the records, stated that the driver of the appellant’s car joined the road without giving way, hence the collision. The appellant did not tender evidence, by either presenting the driver of the accident vehicle, or another, to testify on the aspect of liability. The defence case was closed without offering any evidence, and the witness statement, that had been placed on record, by the appellant, was not adopted as defence evidence. So, the only available evidence, on what transpired, was that adduced by the respondent. That evidence was not controverted, and the trial court had no other material upon which it could rely on, on the matter of liability.






8.
The accident had been admitted in the defence. There was a collision. The only issue outstanding was establishing who, between the 2 drivers, was responsible for the collision. The respondent adduced evidence. The appellant did not. The respondent adduced evidence that the appellant was to blame for the accident, based on the facts presented by PW1 and PW2. The appellant did not present counter-evidence. Based on the that, the trial court was justified to conclude that the appellant had not provided any evidence, which it could use to apportion liability as between the 2 parties.






9.
I agree, the respondent adduced evidence to establish negligence on the part of the appellant. The standard of proof required was on a balance of probability, not proof beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent discharged the burden upon her, to the required standard. There was a collision, the respondent was a passenger in her vehicle, and an eyewitness, therefore. PW2 produced police records, where blame was apportioned on the appellant. PW2 was not the investigator of the accident, but he had the relevant police records on the same. Based on the preponderance of the evidence adduced, the appellant was liable. He chose not to adduce evidence to challenge the case by the respondent, and, thereby failed provide a basis upon which the court could apportion liability as between the 2 drivers in the manner proposed in his written submissions.






10.
The appellant argues that liability ought to have been assessed on a 50:50 basis. He has not laid basis for that submission. I reiterate, that the trial court would have gotten into the exercise of apportioning liability, as between the parties, if both sides had adduced evidence on what transpired. Only 1 party adduced evidence, and, without the input from the other side, there was no way the trial court would have begun apportioning liability as between them, when it only had 1 version of what transpired. The appellant, perhaps, has in mind the principle that where there is evidence of a collision between 2 or more motor vehicles, but inadequate evidence on how the collision happened, then the court should find and hold both sides liable. See Lakhamshi vs. Attorney General [1971] EA 118 (Spry VP, Lutta & Mustafa, JJA), Domitila Wangui Karugu & another vs. Dagu Hidris Haide [2020] eKLR (Majanja, J), Amani Kazungu Karema vs. Jackmash Auto Ltd & another [2021] eKLR (Nyakundi, J) and Ndatho vs. Chebet [2022] KEHC 346 (KLR)(Gitari, J). However, that principle works best where both sides present conflicting versions of what transpired, or the versions presented fail to bring any light into the issue of who was to blame for the collision. In this case, there was only 1 version, according to which the appellant was said to have had rammed into a vehicle that had right of way. The appellant had no answer to that testimony, and, therefore, that was the only explanation available, and the trial court believed it. I have been unable to find basis for differing with the trial court on the matter of liability.






11.
On quantum, the appellant has issue with only 1 item, the claim of Kshs. 90,000.00, for loss of user, on the basis that the same was neither pleaded, nor proved. Loss of user is in the nature of a special damage. It is trite that a special damage must be not only specifically pleaded, it has to be specifically proved. See Hahn vs. Singh [1985] KLR (Kneller, Nyarangi JJA, & Chesoni, Ag JA) and Douglas Kalafa Ombeva vs. David Ngama [2013] eKLR (Mwera, Warsame & Gatembu, JJA). Was there a specific pleading of the loss of user, of Kshs. 90,000.00, in the plaint? I see on record a plaint, which is undated, but was filed in court on 12
th
 May 2017. At paragraph 6 of the plaint, in the particulars of special damage, is a claim for hire of a taxi for a period, against a value of Kshs. 90.000.00. So, there was a specific pleading of the said special damage.






12.
Was that alleged special damage specifically proved? The respondent testified on 9
th
 March 2021. She said that she had hired a taxi, for approximately 1 month, at an approximate cost of Kshs. 90,000.00. She paid Kshs. 200.00. A copy of a receipt of Kshs. 500.00 was referred to, but not produced. She also referred to payments made by cheques, totalling Kshs. 13,000.00. However, copies of the alleged cheques, or their encashment or payment, were not put in evidence as exhibits. Based on that, the claim for Kshs. 90,000.00, in respect of hire of a taxi, was not specifically proved, and should not have been awarded. I agree with the appellant, that the same should be deducted from the amount awarded by the trial court.






13.
In the end, I find merit in the appeal, only to the limited extent of the claim for Kshs. 90,000.00, and I hereby allow it, to that limited extent. The effect shall be that the appeal herein is hereby dismissed, on the aspect of liability, but allowed, on the aspect of special damages, so that the amount awarded, of Kshs. 233,500.00, is reduced by subtracting from it Kshs. 90,000.00, and substituting the judgment sum with Kshs. 143,500.00. This appeal is disposed of in those terms. Each party shall bear their own costs, of this appeal.

Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from orders in the ruling of Hon. G Sogomo, Principal Magistrate, PM, delivered on 31st May 2022, in Milimani CMCCC No. E2585 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit at the primary court was initiated by the respondent, against the appellant, for a declaration that an electricity bill of Kshs. 3,353,279.00, of 9
th
 April 2019, was unjustified and without basis; an injunction to bar the appellant from recovering that amount from the respondent; an injunction to bar the appellant from disconnecting electricity supply to the respondent over the disputed bill; general damages; damages for financial loss; special damages; and costs and interests. The case, by the respondent, was that the appellant had disconnected power to its industrial premises, over the disputed bill, yet the respondent had always paid its bills in time. The plaint, in the primary suit, was filed simultaneously with a Motion, dated 12
th
 May 2022, under certificate of urgency, seeking that the power be reconnected, and injunctions be issued to restrain disconnection of the power, once reconnected, pending the hearing and determination of the dispute.






2.
The appellant did not file a defence, ostensibly as summons to enter appearance had not been served. It did file a notice or preliminary objection, dated 17
th
 May 2022, and grounds of opposition, of even date. The preliminary point of law was that the suit offended provisions of the 
Energy Act
, Cap 314, Laws of Kenya; the Energy (Complaints and Disputes Resolution) Regulations, 2019; the Fair Administration Act, Cap 7L, Laws of Kenya; and 
the Constitution
. The grounds of opposition were around the application being misconceived, and not satisfying the grounds for grant of injunctive relief; and the disconnection of the power not being illegal, given that the respondent was indebted to the appellant for power consumed.






3.
Directions were given on 18
th
 May 2022, for canvassing of the preliminary objection by way of written submissions. Both sides filed written submissions. The court ruled on the matter on 31
st
 May 2022, dismissing the preliminary objection, and allowing the Motion, dated 12
th
 May 2022. The matter was subsequently referred to the Energy Commission for determination, and the decision of the Energy Commission to be thereafter remitted to the court for adoption. Whereas the court conceded that jurisdiction, to determine the dispute around the charges, lay with the Commission, and not the court, it stated that the Commission had no jurisdiction to grant injunctions.






4.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 13
th
 June 2022, revolve around the trial court erring in failing to find that the dispute was wholly within the purview of the 
Energy Act
, 2019; misapprehending the principles governing preliminary objections; delving into issues of fact instead of confining itself to the issues raised in the preliminary objection; failing to appreciate the facts and the law; ignoring submissions made by the appellant; assuming a jurisdiction that the court did not have; and taking into account irrelevant considerations.






5.
Directions were given, on 14
th
 February 2024, for disposal of the appeal, by way of written submissions. I have only come across written submissions by the appellant, in the file of the papers that were placed before me.






6.
The appellant, relying on Abidha Nicholus vs. Attorney-General & 7 others, National Environmental Complaints Committee (NEEC) & 3 others (Interested Parties) [2021] eKLR (Kiage, M. Ngugi & Tuiyott, JJA), submits that there was a 3-tier mechanism for handling disputes against the appellant, starting with a complaint filed at the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, followed by an appeal to the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, and finally to the High Court, upon exhaustion of the appellate process before the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, with respect to matters relating to billing, damages, disconnection, health and safety, electrical installations, interruptions, licencee practices and procedures, among others. Based on Abidha Nicholus vs. Attorney-General & 7 others, National Environmental Complaints Committee (NEEC) & 3 others (Interested Parties) [2021] eKLR (Kiage, M. Ngugi & Tuiyott, JJA), the appellant cites the doctrine of exhaustion, and relies on Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
 and William Odhiambo Ramogi & 3 others vs. Attorney General & 4 others, Muslims for Human Rights & 2 others (Interested Parties) [2020] eKLR (Achode, J. Ngugi, Nyamweya, Ogola & Mrima, JJA) and Cyrus Komo Njoroge vs. Kiringa Njoroge Gachoka & 2 Others [2015] KLR. It is submitted that the trial court ignored section 11(f)(i)(k) of the 
Energy Act
, with respect to what it empowers the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority to do, in terms of the directions it can give for the doing or performance of certain acts.






7.
There is only one issue, in my estimation, for determination, and that is whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the matters in controversy. Once that question is answered, it would dispose of whether there was a proper preliminary objection before the court.






8.
Was the trial court vested with jurisdiction? It is now well settled that jurisdiction goes to the core of any matter, and the court exercises jurisdiction only to the extent that the same is conferred upon it by 
the Constitution
 or statute. See In the Matter of Interim Independent Electoral Commission [2011] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Baraza DCJ, Tunoi, Ibrahim, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ) and Samuel Kamau Macharia & another vs. Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 2 others [2012] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Tunoi, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ). Where jurisdiction lacks, the court ought to down its tools. See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA).






9.
Disputes around charges for electrical energy, and illegal or improper use of such energy, which cover such matters as billing disconnection and reconnection of power supply, are governed by the legislation relating to energy. Jurisdiction over such disputes is delineated by the provisions of that legislation. Section 3 of the 
Energy Act
 provides that that statute prevails over any other law with respect to transmission, distribution, supply and use of electrical energy, and all works and apparatus for any of those purposes. Section 9 of the 
Energy Act
 then establishes the Energy & Petroleum Regulatory Authority, and section 11 of the 
Energy Act
 vests the said Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority with power, among others, to investigate and determine complaints or disputes, make and enforce directions to ensure compliance with the 
Energy Act
, issue orders in writing requiring acts or things to be performed or done, prohibiting acts or things from being performed or done, issue orders or directions, and to impose fines and sanctions. Then there is section 36 of the 
Energy Act
, which establishes the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, and confers it with appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, and original jurisdiction to handle other disputes. Section 36(5) confers power on the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal to grant the equitable reliefs of injunctions and specific performance. There is also jurisdiction to award damages and impose penalties. The Energy and Petroleum Tribunal has both original and appellate jurisdiction over matters that it has mandate to handle. Under section 37 of the 
Energy Act
, a party aggrieved by an order from a decision of the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal has a right to challenge that decision at the High Court.






10.
Clearly, therefore, from the above, there is established a dispute resolution mechanism, with respect to disputes within the energy sector, away from that established under the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Cap 21, Laws of Kenya. Under that arrangement, which the court, in Abidha Nicholus vs. Attorney-General & 7 others, National Environmental Complaints Committee (NEEC) & 3 others (Interested Parties) [2021] eKLR (Kiage, M. Ngugi & Tuiyott, JJA), described as 3-tier, the dispute ought to be first placed before the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, and, if either party is not satisfied with the decision of the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, escalated to the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal on appeal, and, upon either party being aggrieved by the determination by the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, to the High Court on a further appeal.






11.
These alternative dispute resolution mechanisms have been recognised in Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
. The courts have repeatedly held that Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
, entrenches the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, and where alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are provided for, in a statute governing a certain sector, those mechanisms ought to be exhausted first before there is resort to the ordinary court process. See Geoffrey Muthinja & another vs. Samuel Muguria Henry & 1,756 others [2015] eKLR (Waki, Nambuye & Kiage, JJA) and Jeremiah Memba Ocharo vs. Evangeline Njoka & 3 others [2022] eKLR (Mrima, J). See also Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta vs. Nairobi Star Publications Limited [2013] eKLR (Lenaola, J), Mike Rubia & another vs. Moses Mwangi & 2 others [2014] eKLR (Lenaola, J), Gabriel Mutava & 2 others vs. Managing Director Kenya Ports Authority & another [2015] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA), Council of Governors vs. Attorney General & 12 others [2018] eKLR (Mwita, J), KKB vs. SCM & 5 others [2022] KEHC 289 (KLR)(Mativo, J) and Edarus Salim Hussein & 8 others vs. Shariffia Binti Salim & 3 others [2022] eKLR (Odeny, J).






12.
When the above is taken into account, it would follow that the trial court did not handle the dispute before it within the law. In the first place, it had no jurisdiction at all to handle the dispute. Firstly, because of the alternative dispute resolution mechanism provided for in the governing statute, which requires that the dispute be taken through the alternative process first before being brought to court; and, secondly, because, upon exhaustion of that alternative dispute resolution mechanism, the matter ought to be escalated, by dint of section 37 of the 
Energy Act
, to the High Court, and not to the magistrate’s court. It would follow then that a magistrate’s court would have no jurisdiction whatsoever over matters of the kind that was placed before it. In the second place, as it had no jurisdiction in the first place, it had no legal basis or foundation for purporting to refer the dispute to the organs established under the 
Energy Act
. It could only refer a dispute to those organs where it was properly seized of the matter in the first place. In any case, the entity it purported to refer the dispute to, the Energy Commission, no longer exists, for it has been replaced with the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. In the third place, as there was no authority to entertain the dispute in the first place, the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the reliefs that it purported to. That jurisdiction is conferred on the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal by section 36(5) of the 
Energy Act
. It was, therefore, erroneous of the trial court to find that there was no jurisdiction, under that mechanism, for grant of equitable reliefs, by the organs set up under the 
Energy Act
, pending hearing and determination of the dispute, and to thereafter confer upon itself jurisdiction that it did not have under the governing legislation.






13.
I need to say more on the injunctions and section 36 of the 
Energy Act
. Section 36 confers power on the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal to grant injunctions, but not on the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. It was, perhaps, on that basis that the trial court held that there was no jurisdiction on the Commission to grant injunctions, and then proceeded to confer upon itself such jurisdiction to enable it grant the relief. However, the fact that the jurisdiction is granted to the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, and not the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, would still not be a good excuse for the trial court to confer jurisdiction upon itself, which statute has not vested it with. The provisions of section 36 of the 
Energy Act
 are explicit, the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal can act on matters referred to it. It would follow, therefore, that where the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority is not conferred with some jurisdiction, but the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal is, the way out would be for the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority to refer that aspect of the dispute to the Tribunal, either on own motion or on application. In any case, from my reading of section 36 of the 
Energy Act
, there is nothing that prevents a party from directly approaching the Energy and Petroleum Tribunal, for it has both original and appellate jurisdiction. The concern could be on expedition, on whether the alternative dispute resolution mechanism would be expeditious enough to obviate substantial loss being occasioned on the parties, on account of delay. The answer to that would be section 36(6) of the 
Energy Act
, which enjoins the Tribunal to act expeditiously with respect to the matters that it is seized of.






14.
For clarity sake, let me recite the relevant provisions of the 
Energy Act
.






15.
Section 3(1) of the 
Energy Act
 provides:
“
If there is a conflict between this Act and any other Act, this Act shall prevail on the following matters –
a.
The importation, exportation, generation, transmission , distribution , supply or use of electrical energy;
b.
…
c.
All works and apparatus for any or all of these purposes.”






16.
Section 11 of the 
Energy Act
 states:
“Powers of the Authority
The Authority shall have all powers necessary for the performance of its functions under this Act and in particular, the Authority shall have the power to—
(a)
issue, renew, modify, suspend or revoke licences and permits for all undertakings and activities in the energy sector;
(b)
set, review and approve contracts, tariffs and charges for common user petroleum logistics facilities and petroleum products;
(c)
set, review and adjust electric power tariffs and tariff structures and investigate tariff charges, whether or not a specific application has been made for a tariff adjustment;
(d)
prescribe the form and manner in which any application for any authority, licence, consent or approval under this Act shall be made and the fees payable in respect of such application;
(e)
make and enforce directions to ensure compliance with this Act and with the conditions of licenses issued under this Act;
(f)
issue orders in writing requiring acts or things to be performed or done, prohibiting acts or things from being performed or done, and may prescribe periods or dates upon, within or before which such acts or things shall be performed or done or such conditions shall be fulfilled;
(g)
formulate, set, enforce and review environmental, health, safety and quality standards for the energy sector in coordination with other statutory authorities;
(h)
approve electric power purchase and network service contracts for all persons engaging in electric power undertakings;
(i)
investigate and determine complaints or disputes between parties over any matter relating to licences and licence conditions under this Act;
(j)
enter, inspect and search any premises where an offence is being committed or is suspected to have been committed;
(k)
issue orders or directions to ensure compliance with this Act;
(l)
impose such sanctions and fines not exceeding one hundred thousand shillings per violation per day for a maximum of thirty days;
(m)
enter, inspect and search any premises at which any undertaking relating to petroleum operations is carried out or an offence is being committed or is suspected to have been committed;
(n)
issue orders either requiring acts or things to be performed or done, prohibiting acts or things from being performed or done, and may prescribe periods or dates upon, within or before which such acts or things shall be performed or done or such conditions shall be fulfilled in furtherance of its powers under the law relating to petroleum;
(o)
impose such sanctions and civil fines not exceeding five hundred thousand shillings per violation per day to secure compliance with orders issued under the law relating to petroleum;
(p)
take or remove, for analysis, testing or for use in evidence in connection with the commission of an offence under the law relating to petroleum, samples of petroleum or other substances from any area where any upstream petroleum operations are being carried on; and
(q)
inspect, take extracts from, or make copies of any document relating to any upstream petroleum operations.”






17.
Section 36 of the 
Energy Act
, which states as follows:
“


36.
Jurisdiction of the Tribunal
1.
The Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters referred to it, relating to the energy and petroleum sector arising under this Act or any other Act.
2.
The jurisdiction of this Tribunal shall not include the trial of any criminal offence.
3.
The Tribunal shall have original civil jurisdiction on any dispute between a licensee and a third party or between licensees.
4.
The Tribunal shall have appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of the Authority and any licensing authority and in exercise of its functions may refer any matter back to the Authority or any licensing authority for re-consideration.
5.
The Tribunal shall have power to grant equitable reliefs including but not limited to injunctions, penalties, damages, specific performance.
6.
The Tribunal shall hear and determine matters referred to it expeditiously.”








18.
Section 37(1) of the 
Energy Act
, on the other hand, provides:
“
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Tribunal may, within thirty days from the date of the decision or order, appeal to the High Court.”






19.
One other thing, the trial court disposed of the Motion, on reconnection and injunctions, before affording the parties an opportunity to argue it on its merits. What the trial court was called upon to determine was the preliminary issue around jurisdiction, with respect to the suit itself, not the merits of the application for reconnection and injunctions. The directions that it gave, on 18
th
 May 2022, were for canvassing of the preliminary objection by way of written submissions. No subsequent directions were given relating to disposal of the substantive application on reconnection and injunctions. It was, therefore, improper and unfair to determine the prayers for reconnection and injunctions in a ruling reserved to the issues raised in the preliminary objection, and on submissions limited to the points raised in the objection. It amounted to condemning the appellant unheard on the matter of the reconnection and injunctions. Upon disposing of the preliminary objection, and upon finding and holding that it had jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief, it should have given directions on the disposal of the application, dated 12
th
 May 2022, to afford both sides a fair hearing on the reconnection and injunctions. Of course, this is without prejudice to what I have discussed hereinbefore. My finding and holding remains that there was absolutely no jurisdiction on the part of the trial court to entertain the suit in any way.






20.
In view of what I have discussed above, particularly the fact that the trial court had no jurisdiction, the preliminary objection by the appellant was properly grounded, and ought not to have been dismissed. Instead, the preliminary objection should have been upheld, so that the suit before the trial court was struck out, for lack of jurisdiction. Consequently, it is my finding and holding that the appeal herein is merited, and I hereby allow it, so that the orders, made on 31
st
 May 2022, are hereby vacated, and substituted with an order striking out the suit, in Milimani Commercial Court CMCCC No. 2585 of 2022, with costs to the appellant. The appellant shall have costs of this appeal. It is so ordered.

          (An appeal arising from the judgment of Hon. Lucy Ambasi, Chief Magistrate, CM, delivered on 26th april 2022, in Busia CMCCC No. 30 of 2017)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the respondent, against the appellants, for compensation, arising from a road traffic accident, which allegedly happened on 5
th
 January 2016, along the Kericho-Kisumu road, involving the appellant and motor vehicles registration marks and numbers KCA 396Y and KBN 415C. KCA 396Y was allegedly owned or controlled by the appellants at the material time, and the respondent was travelling in it as a fare-paying passenger, when the same rammed into KBN 415C, which was allegedly stationary. The respondent was allegedly injured in the accident, and he attributed it to negligence on the part of the appellants. The appellants filed a defence, in which they denied everything pleaded in the plaint. In the alternative, they attributed negligence on the respondent and the owner of KBN 415C.






2.
A formal hearing was conducted, on 1
st
 October 2020, when the respondent testified. Judgment was delivered on 15
th
 October 2021, where liability was determined at 100% jointly, general damages at Kshs. 1,500,000.00 and special damages at Kshs. 163,543.00, with costs. The said judgment was set aside, on 4
th
 May 2021, by consent of the parties, with respect to damages, with throwaway costs, and an oral hearing was to be conducted on quantum. That hearing happened on 12
th
 October 2021, when the respondent and his doctor testified. The defence hearing did not take off, but the medico-legal report, the appellants were relying on, was produced, by consent of both parties, on 19
th
 October 2021. Judgment was delivered on 17
th
 February 2022, where liability against the appellants was assessed at 100% jointly and severally, general damages at Kshs. 2,500,000.00, and specials at Kshs. 168,500.00, with costs and interests.






3.
The appellants were aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 4
th
 May 2022, largely turn on the quantum of the damages awarded being excessive.






4.
Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were given on 23
rd
 October 2023, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. Both sides have filed written submissions.






5.
The appellants have submitted that the quantum of general damages, awarded by the trial court, was inordinately excessive, and the decision, in Daniel Owino & another vs. Elizabeth Atieno Owuor [2020] eKLR (Ougo, J), is cited, where an award of Kshs. 400,000.00 was made. The respondent wholly supports the award by the trial court, and relies on the decisions that he had cited at the trial, being Dorcas Wangithi Nderi vs. Samuel Kiburu Mwaura [2020] eKLR (Muchemi, J), China Road & Bridge Corporation vs. Job Mburu Ndungu [2021] eKLR (Mwita, J) and Regina Mwikali Wilson vs. Stephen M. Gichuhi [2015] eKLR (Mabeya, J).






6.
The appeal turns only on assessment of general damages.






7.
The medical record relied on by the respondent, to guide the trial court, was the medico-legal report by Dr. Inyangala Dennis, dated 25
th
 November 2016, as appears in the respondent’s list of documents, dated 9
th
 February 2017, filed in court on 16
th
 February 2017. A replica of the said report was introduced into the record of appeal herein, through a supplementary record of appeal, dated 19
th
 October 2023, filed herein on 23
rd
 October 2023, where it is purported to be dated 5
th
 June 2021. The more serious injuries noted were bilateral tibio-fibular fractures of the legs, that on the left being compound; with cuts on the face, head, chin and legs; and bruises, abrasions and lacerations on the left arm, right hand and the legs. He was treated as an in-patient for 23 days. There was no assessment of permanent disability, but deformities were noted on both legs, with the scars being described as permanent. He was subsequently seen by Dr. Jenipher Kahuthu, who prepared a second medico-legal report, dated 4
th
 October 2018, who identified the injuries sustained as fractures of the left and right tibia and fibula bones, with soft tissue injuries. It was noted that the deformities, of the finger and the legs, noted in the report by Dr. Inyangala, had since cleared.






8.
In its judgement, of 17
th
 February 2022, the trial court did not purport to have had been guided by any judicial authorities, creating a sense that the figure of Kshs. 2,500,000.00 was plucked from the air. It would appear, however, that the trial court relied on the authorities cited by the respondent. In Regina Mwikali Wilson vs. Stephen M. Gichuhi [2015] eKLR (Mabeya, J), the court had awarded Kshs. 2,500,000.00, for multiple fractures involving 4 ribs; communited fractures of the right radius bone; fracture of the right femur, involving its neck, shaft and the condoler region, which were severely communited in many pieces; fractures of the right and left tibia and fibula bones; a fracture of the left femur; deep cut wound on the left knee; and an abrasion wound above the eyebrow. In China Road & Bridge Corporation vs. Job Mburu Ndung’u [2021] eKLR (Mwita, J), the court had awarded Kshs. 2,000,000.00, where the injuries sustained were fractures of the left radius, the left ulna, the right tibia and the right fibula. There were 2 medical reports, where one assessed permanent disability at 50%, while the other assessed it at 15%.






9.
Quite obviously, the injuries, in Regina Mwikali Wilson vs. Stephen M. Gichuhi [2015] eKLR (Mabeya, J) and China Road & Bridge Corporation vs. Job Mburu Ndung’u [2021] eKLR (Mwita, J), were a lot more serious and extensive, compared with what the respondent had suffered, who had only sustained fractures of the left and right tibia and fibula bones, with soft tissue injuries, with no apparent permanent disability, nor deformities.






10.
At the trial, the appellants cited The Third Engineering Bureau China Construction Group Limited vs. Edwin Kinanga Atuya [2021] eKLR (Ougo, J), where the injuries were compound fractures of the left tibia and fibula bones, with soft tissue injuries to the scalp, hands and right leg, and the court awarded Kshs. 500,000.00 for pain and suffering. In Titus Mburu Chege & another vs. JKN (a minor suing through the next friend and mother DWN) & another [2018] eKLR (Ong’udi, J), the injuries were fractures of the tibia and fibula bones of both legs, a broken tooth, soft tissue injuries to the forehead and nose, and loss of consciousness, and the court awarded Kshs. 500,000.00.






11.
The injuries in the cases relied upon by the appellants, that is to say Titus Mburu Chege & another vs. JKN (a minor suing through the next friend and mother DWN) & another [2018] eKLR (Ong’udi, J) and The Third Engineering Bureau China Construction Group Limited vs. Edwin Kinanga Atuya [2021] eKLR (Ougo, J), were closer or comparable to those sustained by the respondent herein.






12.
I have also surveyed the following decisions, where the claimants had suffered similar or comparable injuries. In George Raini Atungu vs. Moffat Onsare Aunga [2021] eKLR (Ougo, J), Kshs. 650,000.00 was awarded for a fracture of the right tibia and fibula bones, a fracture of the left radius and ulna, and contusions to the chest and the pelvis. Nahson Nyabaro Nyandega vs. Peter Nyakweba Omboga [2021] eKLR (Maina, J), it was a compound fracture of the right tibia bone; cut wound on the right leg; and bruises on the face, and the court awarded Kshs. 650,000.00. In Atunga vs. Mogambi [2022] KEHC 9854 (KLR)(Ougo, J), the injuries were fractures of the tibia and fibula bones; dislocation of the right hip joint; multiple lacerations on the lower limb; bruises, with multiple cut wounds, on the upper limbs; Dislocation of the right shoulder; chest trauma; and bruises on the frontal part of the head, and Kshs. 550,000.00 was awarded.






13.
There is also Sammmy Mugo Kinyanjui & another vs. Kairo Thuo [2017] eKLR (Kimondo, J), where the claimant had suffered fractures of the tibia and fibula bones of both legs, and an award of Kshs. 600,000.00 was made. In Pauline Gesare Onami vs. Samuel Changamure & another [2017] eKLR (HA Omondi, J), the injuries were fractures of the tibia and fibula bones of both legs, with lacerations on the neck area, blunt trauma on the chest and a deep cut wound on both legs and shaft, and an award of Kshs. 600,000.00 was made. Kshs. 800,000.00 was awarded, in David Mutembei vs. Maurice Ochieng Odoyo [2019] eKLR (Musyoka, J), for a fracture of the right femur and a proximal fracture of the left tibia. In Damaris Wamucii Kagechu vs. Joseph Kirui & another [2019] eKLR (Msagha, J), Kshs. 1,500,000.00 was awarded, for bilateral compound fractures of the tibia and fibula bones of both legs.






14.
Upon review of the decisions mentioned above, it should be abundantly clear that the damages awarded were so inordinately high, as to suggest application of a wrong principle. I shall, accordingly, set aside the said award, and substitute the same with an award of Kshs. 950,000.00, upon taking into account the seriousness of the injuries, the fluctuation of the local currency and the dates on the authorities reviewed. The appellants have not raised issue with the award on special damages, and, therefore, the same shall remain undisturbed, and so shall the award of costs and interests. The appeal herein is allowed in those terms. Each party shall bear its own costs.

          (An Appeal arising from the judgment and decree of the Employment and Labour Relations Court of Kenya sitting at Nyeri, (Makau, J.) dated 29th May, 2018 in ELRC Cause Nos. 78, 79, 80, 82 & 83 of 2017


Cause 78, 79, 80, 82 & 83 of 2017

          )
        
      






Judgment










1.
The five consolidated appeals challenge the decision of Nzioka wa Makau, J. delivered on 29
th
 May, 2018, sitting at the Employment and Labour Relations Court at Nyeri. The proceedings were instituted by the appellants, who were employed by the Respondent as night guards at the Respondent’s premise located in Juja, Kiambu County seeking    orders for payment of terminal dues and compensation for unfair dismissal from employment.






2.
The appellants’ case before the Employment and Labour Relations Court (ELRC) was that they had been employees of the Respondent for varying periods of time having been employed on different dates, and were each earning a monthly salary of Kshs. 7,500/= as at the time of their termination. The appellants stated that they did not sign any employment contracts with the Respondent. They provided bank statements for their respective bank accounts where their monthly salary was remitted. It was their case that on 20
th
 August 2016, the Respondent, without any justifiable cause, summarily dismissed them from employment, under the guise that they were to be redeployed to another site locate at Athi River. However, the said redeployment did not materialize. Instead, their employment was terminated. The appellants stated that their dismissal was done in total disregard of the procedure outlined in the Employment Act, and was ultimately unlawful and unjustified. The appellants therefore claimed accrued overtime payments, annual leave allowance, one month’s salary in lieu of notice, unpaid house allowance, unpaid salaries for the month of August 2016, underpayment dues, and compensation amounting to 12 months’ gross salary for unfair termination.






3.
In response, the Respondent filed a statement of defence dated 26
th
 May, 2017, essentially denying the appellants’ claim that they had been unfairly dismissed from employment. Through the statement of the property manager, Simon Githae Karuri,    the Respondent explained that the appellants were employed by the Respondent on varying dates as watchmen to guard the Respondent’s premises at Juja. It was the Respondent’s case that a series of robberies occurred at it’s said premises which were attributable to the appellants’ negligence in their duties. The Respondent stated that the appellants failed to raise any alarm or inform the Respondent of the said thefts. The Respondent asserted that the appellants had each signed a certificate of settlement of all terminal dues, which was witnessed by Mrs. R. W. Kiiru, the Labour Officer based at the Thika Sub County Labour Office, and therefore no such dues were owing to the appellants from the Respondent. In rebuttal, it was the appellants’ assertion that the certificate of payment only related to the payment of their salaries for the month of August 2016.






4.
After hearing the parties, the trial Judge concluded that the appellants’ dismissal from employment was unlawful, and that the Respondent had failed to establish fair reason(s) to justify summary dismissal of the appellants. It was the learned Judge’s finding that the Respondent failed to sufficiently establish that the appellants were involved in the series of thefts that occurred at the Respondent’s premises. He further found that even though the appellants’ employment was terminated on the basis of the alleged theft, the appellants were entitled to the safeguards provided under Section 41 of the Employment Act.






5.
With regard to the remedies claimed by the appellants, the learned Judge determined that the appellants had failed to    prove their claim for underpayment as well as unpaid house allowance, overtime and leave allowance. In conclusion, the learned Judge found that the appellants were each entitled to one month’s salary in lieu of notice, as well as compensatory damages for unfair dismissal equivalent to their two months’ salary, the award totaling to the sum of Kshs. 22,500/= for each Appellant. The appellants were also awarded costs of the suit.






6.
Aggrieved by this decision, each of the appellants filed a separate appeal before this court. By consent of the parties, the appeals were consolidated, and the following eight (8) grounds constitute a summary of the appellants’ complaint:
i.
The Learned Judge erred in law and in fact by shifting the burden of proving the terms of employment to the appellants, contrary to the provisions of Section 10 (7) of the Employment Act;
ii.
The learned Judge failed to consider the evidence of each Appellant separately;
iii.
The learned Judge failed to take Judicial Notice of the Regulation of Wages (Agricultural Industry) (Amendment) Order of 2015 in relation to underpayment;
iv.
The learned Judge erred in law and fact by failing to award the appellants underpayment;
v.
The learned Judge erred in law by failing to award the appellants unpaid housing and leave allowance dues;
vi.
The learned Judge erred in law and fact by failing to acknowledge that the Respondent did not satisfy the requirements of Section 45 2(c) of the Employment Act in terms of fair procedure while terminating the appellants’ employment;
vii.
The learned Judge did not consider the prolonged period of time the appellants had stayed unpaid since their termination in awarding compensatory damages, and thereby awarded too little compensatory damages in the circumstances of the case;
viii.
The learned Judge erred in law and fact by failing to consider the submissions by the 5
th
 Appellant to the effect that his name did not appear in the certificate of payment filed and relied on by the Respondent; and by consequently failing to award the 5
th
 Appellant his unpaid salary for the month of August, 2016.






7.
The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions, which were duly filed by the parties. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the burden of proving the terms of an    employment contract, where the same was not reduced into writing, lay with the employer. He faulted the trial court for finding that the appellants failed to prove their claims for underpayment and unpaid house allowance, where the Respondent failed to adduce evidence to the contrary. Counsel faulted the learned Judge for failing to take into account The Regulation of Wages (Agricultural Industry) (Amendment) Order, 2015, which the appellants relied on to establish their claim for underpayment. Counsel explained that the said Order prescribes the minimum salary for a night watchman at Kshs. 11,300.10, while the appellants were paid a salary of Kshs. 7,500 per month. Counsel relied on the decision of this court in Kartar Singh Construction Limited vs Jirmo (Civil Appeal No. 265 of 2019) [2021] KLR and the decision of the Employment and Labour Relations Court in John Enemai Bibilondo vs Lydia Wangare Kariuki Munene [2019] eKLR, where counsel stated that the two courts took into account the prescribed minimum wages in making the award of underpayment. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants testified that they worked 12 hour shifts from 6.00 am to 6.00 pm with one day off per week, and further that they never took leave days. He stated that this evidence was not rebutted by the Respondent, and as such, the appellants were entitled to unpaid overtime and leave allowance. Counsel faulted the trial court for awarding compensatory damages to the sum equivalent to 2 months’ gross salary, as opposed to 12 months’ salary claimed by the appellants, taking into account the Respondent’s blatant disregard for the law and procedure    in terminating the appellants’ employment. He urged this court to allow the appeal as prayed.






8.
In response, counsel for the Respondent submitted that pleadings were not evidence, and that the ELRC rightfully found that the appellants had failed to provide evidence to prove their claims for underpayment, unpaid house allowance, annual leave allowance and alleged overtimes dues. Learned counsel cited the decision of the Employment and Labour Relations Court in the case of Peter Ngunjiri vs Board of Management Magomano Secondary School [2022] eKLR. Counsel stated that the appellants adduced bank statements to prove underpayment, yet the said statements did not properly reflect the sums received in all the months they have been in employment. Counsel invited this court to dismiss the appeal with costs.






9.
This being a first appeal, the role of the first appellate court was well settled in the case Gitobu Imanyara & 2 others v Attorney General [2016] eKLR where this court stated that:
“
An appeal to this Court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this Court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put, they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowances in this respect.”






10.
Having evaluated the record of appeal as well as submissions by parties to the appeal, the issues arising for determination by this court are:
i.
Whether the appellants have a right to appeal where the decree arising from the judgment of trial court has been executed;
ii.
whether the appellants’ claim for house allowance, leave allowance, overtime and underpayment was merited; and
iii.
whether the Superior court erred in awarding the appellants two months’ salary as compensation for wrongful termination of their services by the Respondent.






11.
The Respondent filed a preliminary objection dated 24
th
 January, 2023 The Respondent contends in its written submissions that the appellants, having already executed the decree arising from the decision of the ELRC, cannot therefore challenge the same decision on appeal, as the appellate court may not vary or set aside the said decree. The Respondent urged that by enforcing the decree, the appellants have accepted the decision of the ELRC and cannot therefore challenge the same before this Court. In rebuttal, counsel for the appellants cited Order 42 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules which grants an appellate court jurisdiction to pass any decree and make such order which ought to have been made, or make such further decree or order as the case may require.
Counsel for the appellants further submitted that an appeal does not operate as a stay of execution, and therefore an appeal cannot be defeated by execution of the decree from the primary suit.






12.
It is our considered view that satisfaction or enforcement of a decree does not bar a dissatisfied party from filing an appeal. This court in Machakos District Co-Operative Union Limited vs Philip Nzuki Kiilu [1997] eKLR determined that payment of a decretal sum does not take away a party’s right of appeal. Similarly, this court in the case of Seventh Day Adventist Church East Africa Ltd. & 2 Others vs Masosa Construction Company [2006] eKLR observed that since the Respondent in that case had already recovered the decretal sum and costs attendant to the litigation, and the fact that the right of appeal is a strong right which is rivalled only to the right to enjoy the fruits of judgment, no prejudice would be caused to the Respondent if an opportunity was given to the Applicants to enjoy their right of appeal, even if it is on a matter of principle only.






13.
In the circumstances, this court cannot deny the appellants a right to be heard simply because they have received the award decreed to them by the ELRC.






14.
Turning to the claim of unpaid house allowance, leave allowance and overtime dues, it was the appellants’ contention that the trial Judge shifted the burden of proving the terms of employment from the Respondent, who was the employer, to the appellants. The learned Judge observed that the bank statements provided by the appellants did not properly reflect    the total sums received by the appellants during the term of their service. The appellants submitted that since the Respondent did not provide any documentary evidence to disprove their claim for unpaid house allowance, leave allowance and overtime, then the ELRC ought to have awarded the same to the appellants as pleaded.






15.
We have considered the issue and we find that the ELRC cannot be faulted in the manner it evaluated the evidence on record. The bank statements produced in evidence show fluctuating amounts paid to the appellants during the period of their employment by the Respondent. The appellants’ claim for overtime, house allowance and leave allowance was thrown to the court without the appellants laying any basis for the same. The claim before the court was by the appellants. They had the burden to establish their case to the required standard of proof. The Respondent in its statement of response stated that the appellants were provided with weekly rest days and public holidays and that they were also paid overtime for any holiday they may have worked.






16.
Other than mere allegations of non-payment, which in any event was denied by the Respondent, the appellants did not prove the said allegations. We are of the view that it was not enough for the appellants to provide the court with figures they allege were entitled to them; the appellants had a duty to prove their claim even if the Respondent failed to tender any documentary evidence to the contrary. The appellants did not tender any specific evidence to prove their claim, nor did they make an application prior to the hearing of the claim by the    court that they wished to rely on any records which were in the possession or control of their employer to prove their case. On re-evaluation of the rival submission by the parties on this issue, we cannot disagree with the finding made by the trial Judge. We affirm the finding of the trial court that the appellants failed to properly establish their claim for overtime, house allowance and leave allowance.






17.
The appellants faulted the trial court for failing to take into account The Regulation Of Wages (Agricultural Industry) (Amendment) Order, 2015 (Legal Notice number 116 of 2015) which prescribes a monthly salary for a night watchman at Kshs.11,330. The learned Judge observed that the appellants failed to prove that they were underpaid as the bank statements provided by the appellants did not properly reflect the sums received in all the months they were employed, and that the applicable minimum statutory wages were not teased out to show a nexus between the sums claimed and the wages actually paid. We note that Legal Notice No. 116 of 2015 cited by the appellants prescribes a basic minimum consolidated wage for a watchman at Kshs. 6,278.80, and not Kshs. 11,330 as cited by the appellants. The appellants stated that they earned a monthly salary of Kshs. 7,500. We agree with the learned Judge’s finding in that regard, and it is our considered view that the appellants failed to demonstrate that they were underpaid. The court is aware that there is a Legal Notice No 117 0f 2015 which we think the Appellant sought to rely on but they did not cite the same before the trial court. We leave the issue at that.






18.
The 5
th
 Appellant contended that he was not paid his monthly salary for the month of August, 2016. We note that the 5
th
 Appellant’s name does not appear in the certificate of payment provided by the Respondent which shows details of payment of salary for the month of August 2016. The 5
th
 Appellant is therefore entitled to payment of his salary for the month of August, 2016, for the twenty days he was on duty prior to his termination on 20
th
 August, 2016.






19.
Turning to the issue of the compensatory damages award, we note that from the record, the learned Judge determined that the termination of the appellants’ employment was indeed unfair. The remedies for unfair termination are outlined under Section 49 of the Employment Act, 2007. Section 49(1)(c) in particular provides that the employer may be required to pay to the employee:
“
The equivalent of a number of months wages or salary not exceeding twelve months based on the gross monthly wage or salary of the employee at the time of dismissal.”






20.
Section 49 (4) of the Employment Act sets out several factors which a Labour officer or a court has to take into account in deciding whether to award any of the remedies set out under Section 49(1). They are as follows:
a.
the wishes of the employee;
b.
the circumstances in which the termination took place, including the extent, if any, to which the employee    caused or contributed to the termination; and
c.
the practicability of recommending reinstatement or re-engagement;
d.
the common law principle that there should be no order for specific performance in a contract for service except in very exceptional circumstances;
e.
the employee’s length of service with the employer;
f.
the reasonable expectation of the employee as to the length of time for which his employment with that employer might have continued but for the termination;
g.
the opportunities available to the employee for securing comparable or suitable employment with another employer;
h.
the value of any severance payable by law;
i.
the right to press claims or any unpaid wages, expenses or other claims owing to the employee;
j.
any expenses reasonably incurred by the employee as a consequence of the termination;
k.
any conduct of the employee which to any extent caused or contributed to the termination;
l.
any failure by the employee to reasonable mitigate the losses attributable to the unjustified termination; and
m.
any compensation, including ex gratia payment, in respect of termination of employment paid by the employer and received by the employee.”






21.
Section 50 of the Employment Act gives the Employment and Labour Relations Court power to make an award in line with section 49 aforementioned. The power to award the remedies provided for under Section 49 of the Act is therefore discretionary. Judicial discretion must however be exercised judiciously. This Court in the case of Kenya Revenue Authority & 2 others v Darasa Investments Limited [2018] eKLR observed thus:
“
The Court ought not to interfere with the exercise of such discretion unless it is satisfied that the Judge misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision, or that it be manifest from the case as a whole that the Judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of discretion and occasioned injustice.”






22.
The appellants have asked this Court to find that the compensatory damages awarded by the ELRC, equivalent to the appellants’ two months’ salary, was insufficient, considering the circumstances surrounding the appellants’ termination. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants were paid their salary for the month of August 2016 in December 2016, and that the salary was only paid after the appellants    escalated the matter to the Labour office in Thika. Counsel explained that an award for 12 months’ gross salary in compensation damages would sufficiently compensate the appellants for their unfair termination.






23.
In this case, the trial Judge deemed the award of two month’s salary, amounting to Kshs. 15,000/=, as adequate compensation to the appellants for their unfair termination. Taking into consideration the circumstances of the case and the fact that majority of the appellants’ length of service was less than a year, we are not convinced that the appellants were entitled to twelve months’ gross pay as compensation. In addition, the appellants’ termination was based on allegations of being involved in theft or concealing theft at the Respondent’s premises, albeit the procedure followed for their termination was flawed. We see no misdirection on the part of the trial Judge to justify interference with the damages awarded.






24.
The upshot of the foregoing is that we find that the consolidated appeals herein lack merit and are hereby dismissed, save for the 5
th
 Appellant’s appeal which only succeeds to the extent of the claim for his unpaid salary for the twenty days that he worked in the month of August, 2016.






25.
The Respondent is hereby ordered to pay the 5
th
 Appellant, Mwangangi Mutua, his salary for 20 days that he worked in the month of August, 2016.






26.
Each party shall bear their own costs in this appeal.

Ruling










1.
By a Notice of Motion dated 2/4/2024 and filed on 23/4/2024 the Applicants seeks the following orders;
SUBPARA 1.
Spent.
2.
That pending the hearing and determination of this application inter-parties and/or further directions of this Court, the Petitioners/Applicants be appointed as Guardians Ad Litem for KKM.
3.
That this Honourable Court do conduct a judicial inquiry on KKM in open Court and/or in chambers in order to determine his mental status as provided by Order 32 Rule 15 of the Civil procedure Rules, 2010.
4.
That pending the hearing and determination of this application, this Court do direct that KKM be presented to a doctor for examination on his mental status and a report to that effect be filed in Court within such period as this Court may deem fit and expedient.
5.
That this Court do make any such further directions as it may deem expedient in the circumstances of this case.
6.
That costs of this application be in the cause.






2.
The application is anchored on 7 substantive grounds and the Affidavit in support worn by the 1
st
 Applicant on the same date.






3.
The 1
st
 Applicant deponed that he and his co-Petitioner moved this Court vide their application dated 14/12/2022 seeking inter-alia to be appointed as Guardians Ad Litem to KKM owing to what they believe to be his mental infirmity, that this Court while dismissing their said application held that they had failed to determine the unsoundness of mind of KKM. According to the Applicants, by reason of being laymen, there is need for the provisions of Order 32 Rule of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 to be complied with urgently in the best interest of justice in that; this Court do conduct a judicial inquiry on the mental capacity of KKM as stipulated by Order 32 Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 and a medical examination/assessment be conducted on KKM by a medical expert and report to that effect be filed in Court within such period as this Court may deem just and expedient.






4.
The Applicants maintain that KKM stands to suffer loss and damage should the orders they seek not issue as prayed as his estate risks being wasted by 3
rd
 parties at the expense of justice, that mental status of KKM has worsened since they were last before Court hence rendering appropriate orders is necessary in the best interest of justice.






5.
The 1
st
 Applicant further deponed that Eldoret Chief Magistrate’s Divorce Cause No.116 of 2022 was heard and concluded ex-parte hence KKM and the Respondent are no longer legally husband and wife as insinuated by this Court, that in the remises it would be in the best interest to have him as his Co-petitioner appointed as Guardian Ad Litem for KKM before his mental capacity/status is established by an expert, that the determination of KKM’s mental capacity by a medical expert will have a ripple effect on the petition herein, that the Respondent will not be prejudiced in any way should the orders herein be granted as the mental status of KKM will be established in compliance with the provisions of order 32 Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 with finality.






The Response


6.
The application is opposed by the Respondent vide her Replying Affidavit dated 17/5/2024.






7.
She deponed that the application before Court, is frivolous, vexatious, a malicious afterthought, made in bad and an abuse of Court process and as such ought to be dismissed with costs to her, that the instant Petition is overtaken by events as the same was filed solely to defeat and/or the divorce proceedings against KKM (her ex-husband) but the court has since made a determination in the divorce cause and a decree issued on 23rd November 2023 dissolving the marriage and the circumstances therefore, the Petition is overtaken by events, that the instant application is res judicata as the Petitioner's petition sought the same orders as are being sought in the instant application and this Honourable court vide its ruling delivered on 20th April 2023 dismissed the Petition as, being without merit, an abuse of the court process and waste of the court's time. In the premises therefore, the court instant application is res judicata and ought to be struck out with costs to the Respondent.

She further deponed that was married to KKM and lived together as husband and wife since the year 2008, that prior to being married to the said KKM she worked as his sister's house help and that his mother the late PM died in the year 2006. According to the Respondent, the fact that she rose from a lowly position to be his wife displeased some members of his family who were determined to frustrate the marriage, that the said KKM studied in the United States of America between the year 1999 to 2006 and unfortunately he fell unwell and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in the year 1999 and he underwent a successful surgery in Avera McKenna Hospital and fully recovered before coming back home in the year 2006, that prior to getting married to KKM, they courted for two years and thereafter sought the blessings of their parents when he proposed to marry her and his uncles came to her home in Chepterit, Nandi, for show-up and sought my parents' consent to have her married to their son KM and that her father indicated that he had no objection and the family of my husband came for engagement and dowry negotiations at their Cheptiret home on 8th August 2008, that the two families agreed on dowry of four heads of cattle which the M family paid and thereafter the family prepared a wedding ceremony for them which they solemnized at AIC Mosombor on 12th September 208 presided by Rev. Samson Kipruto Samoei and that the wedding was witnessed by many guests who attended the church service and their reception party at St. John the Baptist Pastoral Centre grounds and that their best couple in the wedding ceremony were Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Meli. The Respondent maintained that her marriage to her former husband was consensual and fully blessed by their parents and both of them had the physical and mental capacity to contract the marriage, that at no point during the marriage negotiations or the actual celebration/solemnization did any issue arise as to dispel the fact of KKM's mental capacity to enter into the said marriage and that no documentation or medical record was ever produced then, nor has any been produced in the instant application to show that the said KKM suffers from any form of mental illness or that he is under any mental incapacity as to affect his decision making faculties.






9.
The Respondent reiterated that the instant application is res judicata as the issues raised herein were conclusively determined by the court vide its ruling issued on 20th April 2023, furthermore, the court having found that his ex-husband was not suffering from any mental incapacity and the issue of “worsening” of this mental condition does not arise, that the court had already found that no cogent evidence had been produced to disprove the said KKM's sanity and it therefore follows that the present application is founded on misapprehensions and falsehood on the part of the Applicants, that when she got married to her husband in 2008 they settled in their matrimonial home in Kapseret and were blessed with their first born child NJM on 18th December 2020, that during all this time, KKM was entering into contracts with various persons for the purchase and sale of various assets and as such it is utterly malicious and in bad faith for the Applicants herein to purport that the said KKM suffered mental incapacity, that at the time when she got married to her husband she was single with two children namely DKB and JJB and that her husband offered to adopt the children as children of the marriage and they agreed so and lived with the said children whom her husband fondly referred to as his children and that in the year 2005 they were blessed with another child: AKM on 26th October 2015 and MJM was born to us on 12th November 2019, that husband named all their children by giving the surname B after his own middle name or M his own surname which was his father's name, that all their children were born in hospital and in the birth notification cards her husband gave out his name and identity card and thereafter processed birth certificates for all the children, that after they got married in the year 2008 to her husband advised her to amend her names as they appear in the national identity card to reflect his surname M that she accepted and was issued with a national identity card bearing her new name VJM.






10.
The Respondent contended that her husband is of sound mind and has never suffered any mental disorder or infirmity as is being purported by the Applicants herein and that this is a malicious ploy by the Applicants to curtail the ends of justice and the same should not be entertained by this Honourable Court, that husband is intelligent and made most of the decisions for the family since they became husband and wife and she has never countermanded his decisions and have rarely disagreed with his suggestions on any issue since he is of sound mind, intelligent, wise and provided good leadership to the family as the head of the family, however some family members who were jealous of her started driving a wedge between them on several occasions culminating in their marriage getting turbulent in the year 2018.






11.
The Respondent is shocked and perturbed by the allegations by the Petitioners alleging that her husband is of unsound mind. According to the Respondent it is clear that the allegations are well orchestrated in a malicious scheme to disinherit her and defraud her husband and her family of their matrimonial property, that the Petitioners are the step nephews of her husband, in that their fathers are her husband's step brothers, that husband had two brothers who are now deceased, the late EKM and the late ACM and that the Petitioners are not the children of my husband's brothers and hence are not her husband's nephews as they allege, that the Petitioners are children of her husband's step-brothers the late JT and the late SK respectively and as such they are distant relatives to husband.






12.
She maintained that the Petitioners lack legal capacity to bring this petition by dint of section 26(1) (b) of the 
Mental Health Act
 as they are not near relatives of my husband, most importantly my husband is a man of sound mind and good health and the provisions of the 
Mental Health Act
 do not apply to him. She added that a person suffering from a mental disorder means a person who has been found to be suffering under the 
Mental Health Act
 and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and person suffering from mental impairment due to alcoholic or substance abuse, that since the definition above does not describe her husband the application before court is fatally defective, incompetent and legally untenable, a medical procedure involving the brain does not amount to a mental disorder within the meaning of section 2 of the 
Mental Health Act
, that since her husband has never been diagnosed with a mental condition, nor treated for any medica1 condition he is. not considered as a person suffering from mental disorder and as such the 
Mental Health Act
 does not apply to him, that the Petitioners lack legal capacity to agitate this application as her husband is a person of sound mind and the Petitioners are not near relatives of my husband, that a guardianship order can only be issued in respect of a person suffering from mental disorder and not in respect of a person of sound mind and in any event only in respect of a situation where the person suffering from a mental disorder is incapable of managing his affairs and is dangerous to himself or to others, that before a person is found to be suffering from a mental disorder, an inquiry is ordered and that inquiry finds that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder and that no basis has been laid for such inquiry. She reiterated that the Petitioners have not produced any medical report diagnosing her ex-husband of any mental disorder neither have they disclosed the nature of the mental disorder, the hospitals that he has attended and the treatment given. She added that Petitioners are actuated by malice against me and a selfish desire to defraud her and her husband of our properties, further that the Petitioners have not been any close to their family but have suddenly emerged from nowhere in a quest to quench their appetite for our matrimonial property, that her ex-husband has been operating his own bank accounts since we got married in the year 2008, furthermore they operate a joint bank account number 011091XXXXXX00 at Cooperative Bank, Eldoret Branch and have been jointly making withdrawals since he is a man of sound mind and that the Petitioners' prayer seeking that they be authorized to withdraw funds from my husband's bank account No. 01116XXXXXX00 is suspicious, malicious and fraudulent as her ex-husband's mental disorder has not been disclosed neither have they shown the discharge summary and medical bill/invoice issued by St. Luke's Hospital and that Petitioners are clearly looking for an opportunity to defraud her husband and her of their family resources, that her ex-husband has the requisite capacity to operate his bank accounts as he has been doing over the years, that in the year her husband and she opened a joint account to receive and manage rental income in respect of our rental units in Jerusalem estate in Kimumu.






13.
She maintained that her ex-husband has the legal capacity to file and defend suits against him as he has been doing over the years and that he also has the requisite legal capacity to enter into contracts and agreements as he has been doing over the year, that Petitioners have not laid any basis for their appointment as legal guardians of the said KKM as they have not brought forward any medical reports or any proof whatsoever to substantiate their allegation that the named KKM suffers from mental incapacity, that the Petitioners being distant relatives who have ulterior motives and there being no basis laid for the petition and the application, the application ought to be dismissed with costs, that it is evident that this petition and application has been generated in response to the petition for divorce filed in Eldoret Chief Magistrate Court Divorce Case No. 116 of 2022 which was rightly determined by the honourable court and a Decree Nissi issued on 21st November 2023, that the Petitioners are disingenuous by alleging that her husband's previous medical condition diagnosed as cancer of the brain which was successfully treated in 1999 amounts to a mental health condition and that the Petitioners' outrageous allegations are actuated by malice, falsehood and greed, that nothing is further from the truth than the allegation that her husband was assessed and found to suffer from mental disability or infirmity, that firstly, the Petitioners have not produced any medical report and assessment report to support the outrageous claim, secondly registration with the National Council for Persons with Disabilities is not prima facie proof of disability in the absence of medical assessment report, thirdly the disability card is suspicious as it is issued from Turbo Sub-County yet my husband is a resident of Kapseret Sub-County and that the Petitioners' Petition is bereft of any legal and factual foundation and ought to be dismissed with costs.






14.
On 19/6/2024, parties were directed to file their respective submissions but at the time of writing this ruling no submissions were on record.








Analysis and Determination


15.
I have considered this application and the Affidavit in support of the same as well as the response and I find that the only issue for determination is whether the orders being sought are capable of being issued.






16.
Part XII of the 
Mental Health Act
, Cap 248 Laws of Kenya provides for judicial power over persons and estates of persons who are shown to be suffering from mental disorder and/or incapacity.






17.
Section 2 of the Act defines “person suffering from mental disorder” as follows:-
“
person suffering from mental disorder” means a person who has been found to be so suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as psychopathic person with mental illness and person suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol or substance abuse.”






18.
Section 26 provides for custody, management and guardianship
1)
The Court may make orders-
a)
For the management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder; and
b)
For the guardianship of any person suffering from mental disorder by any near relative or by any other suitable person.
2)
Where there is no known relative or other suitable person, the court may order that the Public Trustee be appointed manager of the estate of the guardian of any such person.
3)
Where upon inquiry it is found that the person to whom the inquiry relates is suffering from mental disorder to such an extent as to be incapable of managing his affairs, but that he is capable of managing himself and is not dangerous to himself or to others or likely to act in a manner offensive to public decency, the court may make such orders as it may think fit for the management of the estate of such person, including proper provision for his maintenance and for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for maintenance, but need not, in such case, make any order as to the custody of the person suffering from mental disorder.






19.
In this case, the Applicants are requesting to be appointed as Guardian Ad Litem for KKM. They are also asking the Court to conduct a judicial inquiry on KKM in order to assess his mental status. Additionally, they are seeking a directive from the Court for KKM to undergo a mental status examination by a doctor, and for a report on the examination to be filed in Court. Nevertheless, the Respondent has contested this current request on the basis that the Applicants do not have the legal standing in this matter. She argued that the Applicants are not immediate relatives and are step-nephews of the aforementioned KKM, therefore lacking locus standi.






20.
In the case of Law Society of Kenya …Vs… Commissioner of Lands & Others, Nakuru High Court Civil Case No.464 of 2000, the Court held that ;-
“
Locus Standi signifies a right to be heard, A person must have sufficiency of interest to sustain his standing to sue in Court of Law”. Further in the case of Alfred Njau and Others ..Vs.. City Council of Nairobi ( 1982) KAR 229, the Court also held that;-
“the term Locus Standi means a right to appear in Court and conversely to say that a person has no Locus Standi means that he has no right to appear or be heard in such and such proceedings”.






21.
A claim that one has no locus standi therefore challenges a party’s right to be heard before a court and if a determination is made in the affirmative then this issue has the capability of disposing of the suit. A claim that a party lacks locus standi therefore is a pure point of law and one that needs to be raised and determined at the earliest.






22.
Having made a determination that the issue of locus standi is a pure point of law, there is need to determine whether the plaintiff has a right to be heard before this court. From the pleadings before this Court, it is without a doubt that the Applicants herein lack the locus standi to seek the orders being sought in the instant application. As observed in my ruling dated 20/4/2023, the Applicant being step-nephews to the said KKM cannot be considered near relatives for purposes of this application, further the said KKM has not been proved to lack capacity . At this juncture the Court cannot on its own motion order that the said KKM be subjected to mental assessment whereas the nothing to warrant granting such orders. It must be remembered that Court orders are never issued in vacuum, they must be capable of enforcement.






23.
Based on the foregoing, it is my finding that the Applicants as no locus standi to bring the suit herein.






24.
In the end, it is my finding that the Applicants’ Application dated 2/4/2024 lacks merits and is hereby dismissed with costs to the Respondents.

On 9.3.2023 an originating summons was filed pursuant to Section 45(3) of

2.
This matter as at 18.4.2024 waws yet to be prosecuted. This is in contravention to Order 17 Rule 2 of the CPR . There is no explanation for the lengthy delay to prosecute the originating summons. The application is therefore dismissed for want of prosecution with no orders to costs.

Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Kakamega (G. Dulu, J) delivered on 31st July, 2018 in HCCRA No. 198 of 2011)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This is a second appeal by the appellant, JMI, against his conviction and the sentence of life imprisonment, that was imposed upon him by the Magistrate’s Court at Kakamega, for the offence of incest by a male person contrary to Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006.






2.
The particulars of the offence were that on the 13
th
 day of August, 2010 at [Particulars Withheld] village, Mutaho Sub-location within Kakamega South District, he unlawfully and intentionally inserted his genital organ namely penis, into the genital organ namely vagina of JK (name withheld), a girl aged 9 years, who to his knowledge is his daughter. The appellant also faced an alternative count of an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006, but no finding was made on this count the appellant having been found guilty on the main charge of incest.






3.
During the trial, seven witnesses testified for the prosecution, and the appellant gave a sworn statement. The child victim, JK, has some element of mental disability. She is 9 years old and was, at the material time in class one, since she suffers from developmental disabilities. She was declared a vulnerable witness by the court, and her evidence was taken through the assistance of an intermediary, her teacher Limio Mombo, who is a trained ECD teacher.






4.
JK is a beneficiary of a project known as Imbale Child Development Centre, run by ACK St Andrews Church. David Muchama Andeka, who was also referred to by the witnesses as Joseph Andeka (Joseph), is a Director of the project. Henry Musamba (Henry) is the Treasurer of the project whilst Joyce Anyango (Anyango) is a spiritual teacher at the school.






5.
On the material night, JK was asleep with her two younger sisters, when the appellant, who is her father called her. She woke up and went to the bedroom where her father was. He then asked her to remove her underpants after which he inserted his penis into her vagina. JK screamed and the appellant beat her up, so she ran away and went to her uncle, S’s, house where she spent the night. The next morning Joyce, who is her spiritual teacher, noticed that her eyes were swollen and she was crying. Joyce sought to know from JK what was wrong. The child did not immediately tell her, but later, when Joyce was alone with the child, she opened up and informed Joyce that her father had on the previous night defiled her, and beat her up when she cried. The child explained that, that was not the first time her father had defiled her, and that her mother was not staying with them.






6.
Joyce reported the matter to Joseph and then took JK to Bukura Health Centre where she was examined and referred to Kakamega Provincial Hospital. Joseph and Joyce took JK to Kakamega Hospital where she was examined by Francis Wasike (Wasike), a clinical officer, who found that JK had lacerations on her labia minora. Wasike concluded that there was attempted defilement, but that
penile penetration was not complete. Later, Joseph took JK to Elvina Namalwa Siniat (Elvina) an assessment teacher with the District Education Office in Kakamega, who assessed JK and noted that she was traumatized. Elvina, who estimated JK’s age as 9 years, concluded that her mental status was due to lack of parental care and the incidence of defilement. Following a report made by Henry at Isulu Police Patrol Base, the appellant was arrested and charged.






7.
In his sworn statement, the appellant vehemently denied having committed the offence. He stated that on 14th August, 2010, he came home at around 4:00 pm and learnt from JK, who is his daughter, that a teacher called Joseph had taken her to hospital. He was not alarmed because the child was a beneficiary of the Child development project, and she had been coughing and her eyes would also sometimes be swollen. He thought the medication JK was given was for the cough. Later the appellant heard of the allegations that he was mistreating his children. He denied the allegations, and stated that there was a grudge between him and his brother Simon; and that there was a plan to take his land because he only had daughters. He added that if JK was defiled, it might have happened at the school, and that the teacher had bought JK new shoes so that she could testify against him.






8.
The trial magistrate, in convicting the appellant, believed the evidence of JK as he found her an honest witness with no reason to lie against her own father. The trial magistrate found the evidence of JK consistent with that of Joyce to whom she reported the matter, and also the evidence of the clinical officer who examined her and prepared the P3 form and the post rape form.






9.
In his appeal to the High Court against his conviction and sentence, the appellant faulted the trial court for failing to find: that he was not represented; that he was not sufficiently supplied with the prosecution statements; that the case was unconstitutional; that he was not subjected to medical examination; that he was not treated as a first offender; and that the trial magistrate failed in rejecting his defence of alibi. However, this first appeal was not successful, hence the second appeal now before us.






10.
In his appeal to this Court, the appellant has raised five grounds which he referred to as supplementary grounds. He faults the learned judge for: failing to find that the evidence of a mentally retarded person is inadmissible; failing to note that the interpretation in the trial court was done by a person who does not understand Idakho language; failing to find that the appellant was not informed of his rights to representation nor accorded an advocate to represent him; failing to find that the appellant was tried on a defective charge sheet; and failing to note that there was bad blood between the appellant and the witnesses.






11.
During the hearing of the appeal before us, the appellant appeared in person, while the State was represented by Mr. Chacha from the Office of Director of Public Prosecution. Bothe the appellant and the respondent, fully relied on their written submissions.






12.
The appellant in his written submissions that was filed in person, contended that he was subjected to an unfair trial as he was never supplied with the documents that the prosecution intended to rely on, and that the case took unduly long without any good reason. In addition, he was not informed of his right to representation nor was he availed an advocate at the government’s cost.






13.
The appellant submitted that the prosecution case was not proved to the required standard. This is because, he argued, the child’s assessment was not done by an expert as required under Sections 48, 49, and 50 of the 
Evidence Act
, nor was her age ascertained by a medical doctor. He faulted the clinical records and books kept by the teachers, that were relied upon by the trial court, maintaining that the same are unreliable as they can be easily manipulated. He took issue with the intermediary that was appointed by the trial court, maintaining that she could not interpret Idakho language as she had stated that she only knew the language partly.






14.
The appellant argued that neither the age of the complainant nor penetration was proved because crucial witnesses were not called, and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was marred with contradictions. He noted that Section 36 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 was not complied with as there was no DNA testing that was done. He identified the Chief as a crucial witness who was not called. He faulted the evidence of Elvina as she did not produce an original letter confirming her assessment of the age of JK. He argued that the evidence regarding the age of JK was contradictory as Elvina gave her age as 9 years whilst PC Gichuru gave her age as 8 years. Further, that although JK claimed that she was defiled 4 times, there was no discharge of fluids or spermatozoa that was noted, and the hymen was intact. He opined that the lacerations on the labia minora may have been due to physical exercise.






15.
The appellant complained that his defence regarding bad blood that existed between him and the prosecution witnesses, as well as his mitigation were not considered; and that he was tried and convicted on a defective charge sheet as the evidence adduced was inconsistent with the charge sheet. He pointed out discrepancies in the charge sheet, such as the age of the complainant, which was indicated as 8 years old, while in the testimony it was indicated as 9 years old; and the names of the witnesses on the charge sheet which were different from the names of the witnesses who actually testified.






16.
Regarding the sentence, the appellant submitted that the mandatory life sentence imposed upon him was unconstitutional and contravened Articles 25, 26 and 50(2) of 
the Constitution
. He relied on the Supreme Court decision in Francis Kariokor Muruatetu and Another vs Republic; Petiti
on No 15 of 2015
 and 
Gerald Macharia Githuku vs Republic, Criminal Appeal No 119 of 2004
.






17.
For the respondent, Mr. Chacha submitted that contrary to the appellant’s assertion that he was not supplied with the evidence that the prosecution intended to rely on, the record of the trial court proceedings indicated that the appellant applied for witness statements, and an order was made for the statements to be supplied to him. Thereafter, the appellant was always ready to proceed with the hearing, and thoroughly cross examined the witnesses, an indication that he had been supplied with the statements.






18.
On legal representation, Mr. Chacha relied on Halgryn vs S (2002) All SA 159 at page11, a decision from South Africa, in which Articles 35(3)(f) and 35(3)(g) of the South Africa Constitution that is identical to Article 50(2)(g) and 50(2)(h) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, was interpreted as follows:
“
The constitution
 has two provisions which are relevant to the argument: the right to chose a legal representative and to be represented by that person (Section 35(3)(f), and the right to have a legal representative assigned by the State and at a state expense if substantial injustice would otherwise result (Section 35(3)(g). Although the right to chose a legal representative is a fundamental right and one to be zealously protected by the courts, it is not an absolute right and is subject to reasonable limitations (R. vs Speid (1983) 7CRR 39 at 41). It presupposes that the accused can make the necessary financial or other arrangements for engaging the services of the chosen lawyer and furthermore, that the lawyer is readily available to perform the mandate having due regards to the courts organization and the prompt dispatch of the business of the court…”






19.
Mr. Chacha argued that the right to representation under Article 50(2)(g) of the Kenya Constitution, involves a choice to be represented and not a guarantee of representation; and that the record of appeal does not show any denial of the appellant’s right to legal representation, but shows that the appellant elected to represent himself. Mr. Chacha submitted that the charge of incest that the appellant faced was properly particularized in the charge sheet, in accordance with Section 20 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
; and that the record does not reveal any misunderstanding of the charge by the appellant. Counsel added that the issue of a defective charge sheet, was not available for consideration by this Court as it was not raised on first appeal.






20.
Mr. Chacha further submitted that the ingredients of the charge against the appellant were proved beyond reasonable doubt. This included penetration, which was proved through the evidence of JK who testified that the appellant defiled her, which evidence was relied upon by the trial court under Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
. The evidence of JK was corroborated by the evidence of Joseph, Elvina, Henry and Joyce who responded to JK’s report and helped escort her to Hospital and the police, and Wasike who examined JK and confirmed that there was partial penetration after noting vaginal lacerations.






21.
On failure to call crucial witnesses, Mr. Chacha argued that the prosecution had the prerogative to determine the witnesses to call. That as per the concurrent findings of the trial court and the first appellate court, the evidence of the witnesses who testified was sufficient to prove the charge against the appellant. Counsel cited JAO -vs- Republic [2011] eKLR for the proposition that this Court should not interfere with concurrent findings of the two lower courts as they were based on sound evidence. In regard to JK’s mental status, Mr. Chacha argued that her evidence was given through an intermediary, and that the intermediary who was professionally qualified properly communicated JK’s evidence.






22.
In regard to sentence, Mr. Chacha relied on Rule 4 of the Sexual Offences Rules of Court 2014, for proof of the age of JK which was assessed as 9 years and confirmed through a child’s health card. He submitted that under Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the appellant was liable to life imprisonment; and that the offence was a barbaric act that deserved such a deterrent sentence. Mr. Chacha added that severity of sentence was a matter of fact that was not open to this Court’s intervention.






23.
We have carefully considered this appeal, the contending submissions and the law. The appeal before us being a second appeal, we are mindful of the limitation in our jurisdiction to considering matters of law only. We also take cognizance of our responsibility to pay homage to the concurrent findings of the two lower courts, and only interfere if the findings were not based on evidence, or were based on a perverted appreciation of the facts or if on the totality of the evidence, no reasonable tribunal properly directing itself would arrive at such findings, in which event, the decision is bad in law, thus entitling this court to interfere. See Nyale v Republic (Criminal Appeal 54 of 2021) [2023] KECA 1081 (KLR) (22 September 2023) (Judgment); and Rashid v Republic (Criminal Appeal 90 of 2021) [2023] KECA 596 (KLR) (26 May 2023) (Judgment).






24.
The issues that we discern for our determination are whether the issues raised by the appellant regarding infringement of his right to a fair trial, and the charge sheet being defective, are open to us for consideration; if so, whether there was infringement of the right to a fair trial and whether the charge sheet was defective. In addition, there is an issue as to whether the learned Judge of the High Court considered and re-evaluated the evidence, and whether based on that evidence the charge against the appellant was proved to the required standard.






25.
We have perused the record of appeal, and do note that the appellant raised some grounds that concerned his right to representation, and failure to serve him with prosecution witness statements. The High Court in its judgment addressed both these two issues and dismissed the two grounds, finding that the complaint regarding representation was misplaced, and the complaint regarding failure to supply prosecution witness statement during the trial had no basis as the record did not show that he requested for and was denied the statements. We are satisfied that these are issues that requires our determination and are properly before us.






26.
We have carefully perused the record of the trial court, and, like the High Court, do find that the appellant never requested to be supplied with witness statements. He cannot, therefore, complain of the alleged failure to supply the statements to him when there was no request. As regards representation, we are in agreement with the submissions made by Mr. Chacha, that Article 50(2)(g) gives the appellant the right to be represented by an advocate of his own choice, but that he must be ready to meet the financial cost. Article 50(2)(h) of 
the Constitution
 provides for a right for an accused to be assigned an advocate at the State’s expense, where substantial injustice would otherwise result. In this case, the appellant was not supplied with an advocate at the State’s expense during the trial or at the hearing of the appeal. He has not satisfied this Court that he suffered any substantial injustice or prejudice due to this failure. During the trial he robustly defended himself by cross examining the witnesses at length. During the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, he was represented by an advocate of his choice. We therefore find that his rights under Article 50(2)(g) & (h) of 
the Constitution
 were not violated.






27.
As concerns the alleged defective charge sheet, there is no ground in the appellant’s petition filed in the High Court, that raises this issue. The issue was not raised before the trial court, nor did it form a ground for appeal before the High Court. Nor did the High Court render itself in on the issue. This means that the matter is improperly before us as it is being raised for the first time on this second appeal. The appellant is, accordingly, precluded from raising it in this appeal, and the issue is not, therefore, open for our determination. See John Kariuki Gikonyo v Republic [2019] eKLR and Alfayo Gombe Okello v. Republic [2010] eKLR Criminal Appeal No. 203 of 2009;






28.
The appellant, having been charged with incest under Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, it was incumbent for the prosecution to prove that JK was the daughter of the appellant. Secondly, that the appellant committed the act of penetration by inserting his genital organs into the genital organ of JK and thirdly, that JK was nine years old as alleged in the charge sheet.






29.
The relationship between the appellant and JK was not in dispute as the appellant admitted that JK was his daughter. As regards penetration, this is defined under Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 as “the partial or complete insertion of the genital organ of a person into the genital organ of another person.” JK testified that the appellant inserted his genital organs into her genital organs. The appellant took issue with the court’s use of an intermediary in accepting JK’s evidence. However, he did not dispute the fact that JK had a mental challenge. Contrary to the appellant’s assertion that JK’s evidence was inadmissible, there is no law that renders the evidence of a person with a mental challenge inadmissible, more so, where the evidence is taken with the aid of an intermediary. Although the appellant complained that the intermediary did not understand Idakho language very well, the Court record is very clear that JK spoke in Idakho, which was translated by a court clerk Ramadhan Mate and which language the appellant said he understood very well. Therefore, neither the intermediary nor JK or the appellant was disadvantaged in any way.






30.
Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, allows a trial court, where an accused person is charged with an offence under the 
Sexual Offences Act
, to base a conviction on the evidence of the victim only, provided the court is satisfied that the witness is speaking the truth. Both the trial court and the first appellate court found JK’s evidence credible and sufficient to be relied upon under that section. The trial magistrate who saw and observed JK testify, was in a position to, and did assess her demeanor, which advantage we do not have as an appellate court, and have no reason to question. Moreover, JK’s evidence was consistent with the evidence of Joyce, Joseph and Henry to whom she narrated her ordeal. Her contention that she was defiled was corroborated by the medical examination which was done by Wasike, and which confirmed that there was partial penetration.
In the circumstances we are satisfied that the ingredient of penetration was proved.






31.
As regards the age of JK, the charge sheet dated 19
th
 August, 2010, gave the particulars of JK as a girl aged nine years. In her evidence, JK who gave her evidence on 12
th
 January 2011, stated that her age was ten years old. Elvina who saw her on 29
th
 November, 2010, estimated her age as nine years old. Wasike who examined JK immediately after the defilement estimated her age as nine years old. The appellant who gave sworn evidence in his evidence on 5
th
 July, 2011, stated JK’s age as ten years old. We have not seen any material contradiction regarding JK’s age. She was around nine years old at the time she was defiled and was around ten years old at the time some witnesses testified. Therefore, the charge sheet stated the correct position. Moreover, under Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, it was sufficient that JK was under eighteen years old as this brought the proviso to Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 into play, the appellant being liable to imprisonment for life. Consequently, we are satisfied that the evidence adduced regarding JK’s age was sufficient to establish her age as charged, and sufficient for purposes of the penalty proviso under section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






32.
In his judgment, the learned Judge concluded as follows:
‘’Having re-evaluated all the evidence on record, I find the prosecution proved its case against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt. The complainant being a child of the appellant had no reason to fabricate lies against the father about the incest. The medical evidence showed that indeed there was partial penetration. The appellant took advantage of the absence of his wife to commit the offence. Though the appellant complains that the person to whom the complainant sought refuge [Simon] was not called to testify, he himself could also have called that person to testify. He did not. There is no evidence that the person witnessed the incident anyway. There is also no evidence that that person connected the appellant with this offence. I find that the failure of the prosecution to call the witness did not dent the prosecution case.’’






33.
We are satisfied that the learned Judge properly considered and re- evaluated the evidence, and that all the ingredients of the charge of incest were proved against the appellant. The learned Judge was, therefore, right in dismissing the appeal against conviction.






34.
As regards the sentence, under Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, severity of sentence is a matter of fact that is not open for our consideration. The record reveals that the trial magistrate exercised his discretion. Although the appellant was treated as a first offender, he opted not to give any mitigation. The learned Judge of the High Court considered the appellant’s appeal against sentence and concluded that the sentence was both legal and appropriate given that the child victim was traumatized and would have to deal with the incident for the rest of her life.






35.
Moreover, although the appellant was sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence, he did not raise any issue before the High Court, regarding the constitutionality of the indeterminate life sentence. Before us the appellant has raised the issue in his written submissions. However, the constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment under Articles 28 and 29(f) of 
the Constitution
, is different from challenging the constitutionality of minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
, for fettering the discretion of the sentencing court. In accordance with the Supreme Court decision in Gichuki Mwangi: Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 Others (amicus curio) [2024] 34KLR, the issue of the constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence is not open to us for consideration at this stage as it was neither raised in the High Court nor preserved as an issue that could be argued before us.






36.
In the circumstances, we have no jurisdiction nor do we have any justification to interfere with the sentence. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal, and uphold both the appellant’s conviction and sentence.

Applicant










Judgment










1.
The Applicant has filed Originating Summons dated 31 January 2024, seeking the following orders:
i.
That the Applicant be authorised to adopt Baby S.S., an infant who is to be known as P.M, and the Registrar General be directed to enter this adoption into the Register of Adoptions;
ii.
That E.K.M and T.M.N be appointed as legal guardians of the minor who shall be presumed to have been born in Kenya;






2.
The Summons is accompanied by a Statement in Support of the Application for an Adoption Order, Affidavit in Support of the Application and annextures thereto.






3.
The matter was canvassed by way of viva voce evidence on the virtual platform on 4th July 2024.






The Child


4.
The child (female) was born on 25 July 2020. She is almost 4 years old. The child was presented to the Nyeri Central Children’s Office on 29 July 2020 for purposes of adoption by her biological mother. She was referred to KKPI Adoption Services, where the implications of adoption were explained to her. The child was then committed to New Life Home Trust, Nyeri on 30 July 2020 by the Children’s Court at Nyeri.






5.
The child was declared free for adoption by the Buckner Kenya Adoption Services, a registered Adoption Agency, vide the annexed Certificate serial number 0695. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met.




The Applicant


6.
The Applicant is a Kenyan citizen, residing in Buruburu, Nairobi County. She is 45 years old and employed by the Public Service Commission. She is single, with one daughter. The Applicant stated that her motivation to adopt the child is that she wishes to expand her family, and give her biological daughter a sibling.






7.
The child was placed with the Applicant on 27 September 2023. The DCS Report and Guardian ad Litem Report indicate that the child has bonded well with the Applicant and the older sister. The Applicant confirmed that her immediate family has also accepted the child herein. She confirmed that she is fully aware of the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.








The Biological Parents


8.
From the DCS Report dated 5 June 2024, the biological mother gave the child up for adoption. She signed the initial consent but failed to show up to sign a second consent after the statutory period of 6 weeks. Efforts by the Children’s Office and the Children’s Home to trace the biological mother proved to be futile, thus prompting them to report the matter to the Police. The matter was reported to the Nyeri Police Station vide OB No. 40/11/1/2023.






9.
Details of the biological father are not provided.






10.
In the circumstances, there exists no known person from whom consent for this adoption can be sought and/or obtained. I, therefore, waive this requirement in line with section 185 (4)(b) of the 
Children Act
, Cap 141 of the Laws of Kenya.








The Adoption Application


11.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed to support the suitability of the Applicant as an adoptive parent. The Applicant states that she is a practising Christian and intends to raise the child in the Christian faith.






12.
The Applicant has annexed copies of bank statements and copies of her pay slips as proof of her financial stability. She has provided a copy of clearance certificate from the Kenya Police Service and Recommendations letters as well in proof of her character and good standing.






13.
The Applicant presented E.K.M and T.M.N as proposed legal guardians for the child. The said legal guardians, a married couple, signed a consent dated 31 January 2024 indicating their willingness to step in and care for the child in the event the Applicant is unable to provide for the child. E.K.M is a sister to the Applicant, while T.M.N is her brother-in-law. The proposed legal guardians confirmed that they understood their role.






14.
From the material availed, I am satisfied that the Applicant is a suitable adoptive parent.








Analysis and Determination


15.
Article 14 (4) of 
The Constitution
 provides as follows:
A child found in Kenya who is, or appears to be, less than 8 years of age, and whose nationality and parents are not know, is presumes to be a citizen by birth.






16.
The child was presented for adoption by her biological mother a few days after she was born. I, therefore, declare that the child is a citizen of Kenya by birth.






17.
In deciding any matter involving a child, the court is obligated to give priority to the best interest of the child. Section 8 of the 
Children Act
 provides:
1.
In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies –
a.
The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;
b.
The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule;
2.
All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to:-
a.
Safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;
b.
Conserve and promote the welfare of the child; and
c.
Secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in the public interest.






18.
I have considered the Reports filed by the Adoption Agency, the Guardian Ad Litem, the Director of Children Services, all of which were positive and recommended the adoption. It is therefore my view that the adoption does serve the best interests of the child.






19.
Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicant, R.K.G, is allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby S.S;
ii.
Upon adoption, the child shall be renamed P.M;
iii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iv.
E.K.M and T.M.N are appointed as Legal Guardians of the child,
v.
The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;
vi.
That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;

Ruling










1.
VNR, EMK and RGK were children of the subject James Boro Karugu. On 3
rd
 March, 2016 they filed petition seeking:
i.
That the Petitioners being VNR, EMK and RGK in respect of JBB (hereafter referred to as the ward)
ii.
That the Petitioners shall jointly act as managers ad guardians in accordance with the directions and orders of the court and in particular to jointly have access and operate the Ward’s bank accounts.
iii.
That the Costs and legal fees of the Petition be provided from the ward’s estate.






2.
LMK, VNK and AWK who are from the 2
nd
 house of the subject filed an application dated 22
nd
 November, 2025 seeking to be included as managers and guardians of the subject. Protracted litigation proceeded which included the submissions of DNA reports and the issue of access to the subject while some of the filed applications were pending for hearing the court was informed that the subject died on 20
th
 November, 2022.






3.
Upon the death of the subject M/s Irundi for Petitioners sought leave to withdraw the petition which was granted on 20
th
 May, 2024. The petitioner was their hereby marked as withdrawn.






4.
Mr. Mugo holding brief for Wambugu representing HWM informed court that upon the withdrawal the only issue pending was a determination on costs. M/s Ndirangu for VNK confirmed that this was the only issue pending. By consent directions were issued that the issue at costs be canvassed by way of written submissions. Both parties complied.






5.
M/s Judy Thongori for LMK, VNK and VNK in her submissions dated 12
th
 February, 2024 submitted that generally the costs follow the event. She submitted that her clients were drawn into this matter to challenge the involvement of the guardians and managers; the managers had continued to deny her clients’ access to the subject and were mismanaging the subject’s funds. Counsel, therefore, submitted that upon withdrawal of their petition, thought this is a family matter her clients should be awarded costs.






6.
M/s Hamilton, Harrison and Matthews Advocates for VNR, EMK and RGK filed submissions dated 15
th
 July, 2024. Counsel submitted that these were proceedings under the 
Mental Health Act
 for appointment of Guardians and Managers of a subject who was suffering from a Mental Illness. The petitioners do only seek to be guardians of the subject and are not parties to the suit. These proceedings ended when the subject died and that the court has no power to order costs against and persons who is not a party. Counsel submits that the petition was only filed in the interest of the ward seeking orders to take care of him.






7.
Counsel, therefore, urges the court to direct that each party bears his own costs. Counsel refers this court to the position in the United Kingdom, in the Court Protection Rules 2007.






8.
The 
Mental Health Act
 was enacted with the object of: -
“
An Act of Parliament to amend and consolidate the law relating to the care of persons who are suffering from mental disorder or mental subnormality with mental disorder; for the custody of their persons and the management of their estates; for the management and control of mental hospitals; and for connected purposes.”






9.
Proceedings under the Act were designed to be motivated by the objective of taking care of the personal welfare of the subject and that the court will not be required to make an order as to costs. However, where the proceedings involve the property of the subject, the same shall be charged on the property or estate. However, fees to the Public Trustees is provided for under Section 33 (1) of the Act.






10.
On Costs, Section 27 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 provides: -
27.
Costs
(1)
Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, and to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, the costs of and incidental to all suits shall be in the discretion of the court or judge, and the court or judge shall have full power to determine by whom and out of what property and to what extent such costs are to be paid, and to give all necessary directions for the purposes aforesaid; and the fact that the court or judge has no jurisdiction to try the suit shall be no bar to the exercise of those powers: Provided that the costs of any action, cause or other matter or issue shall follow the event unless the court or judge shall for good reason otherwise order.






11.
This is a matter which was filed by petitioners to be appointed guardian of the subject and manage his affairs as he was a person who was diagnosed to be suffering from mental illness. Their objective was to manage the welfare of the subject, which included provisions for care-giving, medical attention and general welfare of the subject. They were also to manage the estate of the subject to prevent wastage and manage resources to be used for the welfare of the subject. They were to exercise this mandate under the directions of the court to which they were accountable to under Section 33 of the 
Mental Health Act
 which provides:
Section 33.
(1)
Every person app Manager to furnish inventory and annual accounts jointed by the court to be manager of the estate of a person under this Part shall, within six months of the date of his appointment, deliver to the court and to the Public Trustee (to whom he shall pay such fee as may be prescribed) an inventory of the property belonging to the person of whose estate he has been appointed manager and all such sums of money, goods and effects as he receives on account of the estate, together with a statement of all debts owed by or due to such person, and every such manager shall furnish to the court and to the Public Trustee (to whom he shall pay such fee as may be prescribed) annually, within three months of the 31
st
 December, an account of the property in his charge showing the sums received and disbursed on account of the estate during the year and the balance; such inventory, statement and account shall be in the prescribed form.
(2)
Any person may, on payment of such fee as may be prescribed, inspect and obtain a copy of any inventory, statement or account delivered to the court and to the public Trustee under subsection (1).
(3)
The Public Trustee shall report to the Minister annually on all accounts delivered to him under subsection (2).
(4)
Where any person, by petition to the court, impugns the accuracy of any inventory or statement or of any annual account made under this section, the court may summon the manager and inquire summarily into the matter, and make such order as it thinks proper or the court may refer the petition to a magistrate having jurisdiction in the place where the property belonging to the estate concerned is situated, for inquiry and report, and upon receipt of the magistrate’s report the court may make such order as it thinks fit.”






12.
Hellen Mwaura and LMK filed applications in this matter seeking to be provided for from the estate. Orders were issued by this court for provisions. Other issues they raised had not been determined by the time the subject died on 10
th
 November, 2022. This matter, therefore could not proceed as the subject in whose interest the petition was filed died. They cannot, therefore submit that they are a successful party to whom costs would follow events. In Jasbir Singh Rai & 3 Others Vs Tarlochan Singh Rai & 4 Others (2014) eKLR which cited Kuloba J (Rtd) in Judicial Hints on Civil Procedure, 2
nd
 edition as follows:
the object of ordering a party to pay costs is to reimburse the successful party for amounts expended on the case. It must not be made early as a penal measure. Costs are a means by which a successful litigant is recouped for expenses to which he has been put in fighting an action.






13.
In this case it is not disputed that the petition was filed for the general welfare of the subject. The general rule is that there is no successful party and there will be no order as to costs of the proceedings that concern the subject’s personal welfare.
""159
Departing from the General Rule
(1)
The court may depart from rules 156 to 158 if the circumstances so justify, and in deciding whether departure is justified the court will have regard to all the circumstances, including:
(a)
the conduct of the parties;
(b)
whether a party has succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful; and
(c)
the role of any public body involved in the proceedings.
(2)
The conduct of the parties includes–
(a)
conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings;
(b)
whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular issue;
(c)
the manner in which a party has made or responded to an application or a particular issue;
(d)
whether a party who has succeeded in his application or response to an application, in whole or in part, exaggerated any matter contained in his application or response;”






14.
This is a matter between family members who are connected to the subject who is now deceased. The general rule is that each party would bear his own cots, unless they demonstrate exceptions. I do not see any conduct to invite the application of the exceptions.






15.
Upon considering the applications, I find that the appropriate orders to make which I hereby do is tht each party to bear his/her own costs.

and

Respondent










Ruling










1.
What is coming up for determination is the Notice of motion dated 23/7/2023.






2.
The Applicant has filed a series of documents, some which it is difficult to tell what exactly the Applicant is seeking for . However, after re-reading the documents a few times what I can decipher is that the Applicant is seeking a review of sentence . He has also asked this court to set aside the conviction.






Determination


3.
In April 2010, the Applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by Justice Lenaola. He moved to the court of Appeal under Kisumu Court of Appeal case No. 371 of 2012 to challenge both the conviction and sentence and the Appeal was dismissed on both grounds.






4.
Nevertheless, he applied for re-sentencing under MISC. APP. NO. 23/2015 prompted by the supreme court decision in Francis Miruatetu & Ano vs. Republic (2017) eKLR. In a ruling delivered on 26/8/2021, Justice Musyoka set aside the death sentence and substituted with 30 years.






5.
The Applicant has made another trip to this court to complain about the same issues, namely allegation of wrongful conviction and harsh sentence.






6.
The sentence has been revised by this court, pursuant to the directions given in Muruatetu case before and consequently this court has become functio officio.






7.
In any event, the revisionary powers of the High Court under Article 165(6) of 
the Constitution
 is limited to revision of the lower court decisions but not a court of concurrent jurisdiction. This court therefore has no jurisdiction to revise Justice Musyoka’s orders.






8.
On the conviction, the Applicant’s prayer is again is misplaced. The conviction of this court was affirmed by the court of Appeal. The Applicant’s attempt to seek what is tantamount to an appeal from this court against the decision of the Court of Appeal is mischievous , an act of vexations and an abuse and misuse of the court process.






9.
The Application is hereby dismissed.

Between




Risper Chemutai Kiptarus


 


Appellant




and




Patrick Omanyo Opilit


 


Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from the judgment of Hon. EC Serem, Resident Magistrate, RM, adjudicator, delivered on 7th November 2022, in Busia CMCCC No. E363 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the appellant, against the respondent, for compensation, arising from a road traffic accident, which allegedly happened on 6
th
 March 2021, along the Busia-Adungosi road, involving the appellant and motor vehicle registration mark and number KAZ 912G, allegedly owned or controlled by the respondent at the material time. The appellant, who was allegedly a pedestrian, was injured in the said accident, and she attributed it to negligence from the respondent. The respondent filed a defence, in which he denied liability, and everything else pleaded in the plaint. In the alternative, he attributed negligence on the appellant, and on the rider of the motorcycle, on which he alleged she was a pillion passenger.






2.
A hearing was conducted. 2 witnesses testified for the appellant, and 1 for the respondent. Judgment was delivered on 7
th
 November 2022. The suit was dismissed, on grounds that the appellant had failed to prove her case against the respondent, on a balance of probability. The trial court indicated that it would have awarded Kshs. 300,000.00 for pain and suffering, had it found in favour of the appellant.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 15
th
 November 2022, revolve around the award of Kshs. 400,000.00, general damages, being inordinately low; the trial court not appreciating the evidence and the exhibits; the court disregarding the admission by the respondent that an accident occurred; the court not considering the severe injuries sustained by the appellant; and the trial court basing its decision on the variance between the pleadings and the oral evidence, and ignoring everything else.






4.
Directions were given, on 11
th
 December 2022, on the disposal of the appeal, by way of written submissions. Both sides have filed written submissions.






5.
The appellant has submitted largely on the admission allegedly made by the respondent, with respect to the occurrence of the accident. She submits that that admission should overshadow the pleading in the plaint, that the appellant was a pedestrian, rather than a pillion passenger on a motorcycle. No authorities are cited.






6.
The respondent submits on both liability and quantum. On liability, he submits that the appellant did not prove her case to the standard required under sections 107 and 108 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80, Laws of Kenya. He relies on Nguruman Limited vs. Jan Bonde Nielsen & 2 others [2014] eKLR (Ouko, Kiage, M’Inoti, JJA) and Mrao Limited vs. First American Bank of Kenya Limited [2003] eKLR (Kwach, Bosire & O’Kubasu, JJA). On quantum of general damages, he cites Kemfro Africa Limited t/a Meru Express Services (1976) & another vs. Lubia & another (No 2) [1985] eKLR (Kneller, Nyarangi JJA & Chesoni Ag JA)and Gitobu Imanyara & 2 others vs. Attorney-General [2016] eKLR (Visram, Sichale & J. Mohammed, JJA), to argue that an appellate court should only interfere with the findings and holdings of the trial court, where it is established that the trial court proceeded on the wrong principle or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and, as a consequence, arrived at a figure which was either so inordinately high or low, as to present an entirely erroneous estimate. On special damages, he cites Hahn vs. Singh [1985] KLR (Kneller, Nyarangi JJA, & Chesoni, Ag JA), to make the point that special damage must not only be specifically pleaded, it must be specifically proved.






7.
The appeal herein should principally turn on whether the appellant proved the case that she had placed before the court for determination. The issue of damages is largely secondary.






8.
So what was this case that the appellant had placed before the trial court? According to the plaint filed at the trial court, on 30
th
 August 2021, of even date, the appellant was a pedestrian who was knocked down by a motor vehicle allegedly belonging to the respondent. In her witness statement, dated 30
th
 August 2021, she averred that the motor vehicle lost control and hit her. When she took to the witness stand, on 14
th
 February 2022, she stated that she was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, which was hit by the motor vehicle belonging to the respondent. Her witness, PW2, testified along similar lines. Clearly, the testimonies from the appellant and her witness were at variance with her pleadings, with respect to how the accident happened, on the question whether she was a pedestrian or a pillion passenger in that event.






9.
In the defence, dated 5
th
 October 2021, the respondent denied the facts pleaded in the plaint, and put the appellant to strict proof. He also alluded to the appellant being a pillion passenger on some motorcycle, and attributed negligence on both the appellant and the rider of the alleged motorcycle. In the reply to that defence, dated 14
th
 October 2021, the appellant neither denied nor admitted the allegation about the motorcycle, but merely pleaded that she was joining issues with the respondent. She did not amend her plaint either, to reflect that she was not a pedestrian, at the material time, but a pillion passenger.






10.
Parties are bound by their pleadings. The oral evidence that the parties adduce in court, through their testimonies, should be geared to proving the allegations made in their respective pleadings, and, therefore, their testimonies must be aligned to their pleadings. A party cannot plead one thing in their filings, and then testify to something different in her oral narrative in court. A variance between the pleadings and the oral evidence could be fatal to the case.






11.
The case that the appellant filed in court was that the vehicle driven by the respondent lost control and hit her when she was on the road, as a pedestrian. That is the case she should have presented in her oral evidence. In such a case, negligence would be attributed to a motorist who loses control of their vehicle and hits a pedestrian. The respondent filed a defence, which pointed to the appellant being a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, arguing that the collision, if there was one, must have been between the respondent’s vehicle and the motorcycle on which the appellant was a pillion passenger. In such a case, liability would have to be apportioned, largely, between the driver of the motor vehicle and the rider of the motorcycle, and not between the driver of the motor vehicle and the pillion passenger. Furthermore, the pillion passenger would look up, largely, to the rider of the motorcycle on which she was a passenger, for that would be the person owing a direct duty of care to her. So that where the rider is in collision with another road user, the passenger would be expected to go after the rider, who should then bring the other road user into the suit.






12.
To the extent that the appellant did not establish, according to her plaint, that she was a pedestrian, when the accident happened, and testified that she was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, which was not pleaded or averred in any of her filings, meant that the case presented in her pleadings varied from what she told the court. She could not possibly prove negligence, in the manner pleaded in her plaint, by presenting material orally in court which departed from what was pleaded. The appellant gave the court 2 versions of how the accident happened, in one version, she was a pedestrian, in the other she was a pillion passenger. One version is in the pleadings, the other is in the oral testimony. Pleadings carry the day, for parties are bound by their pleadings, and their oral testimonies must be aligned to their pleadings, as they are meant to prove that which is pleaded. Departing from the pleadings would mean that the party would be orally presenting a case before the court, which is different from that pleaded, which would be unacceptable. A party who presents oral evidence, which varies from the pleaded case, no doubt, loses the case.






13.
The appellant is hanging on the case presented by the respondent, by arguing that the variance between her pleadings and her oral evidence was somewhat remedied by the defence pleading that the accident did happen, but not in the manner pleaded in the plaint, in that the appellant was a pillion passenger, and not a pedestrian. Well, the case before the trial court was filed by the appellant. The evidential burden initially rested on the appellant, to establish that which she had alleged in her plaint, that she was a pedestrian, when the accident happened, and the burden could only shift to the respondent thereafter. She did not prove that she was a pedestrian when the accident happened, and she did not amend her pleadings, to conform to the oral testimony given in court. Both the legal and evidential burdens were not discharged, and the trial court was justified to dismiss the case. The appellant was, no doubt, reckless and casual, in the manner that she approached the suit that was before the trial court. She should not have expected or waited for the opposing side to plug the gaps in her own case.






14.
I believe it would be academic to decide on whether the trial court properly assessed the quantum of damages it would have awarded, were it to find in favour of the appellant. I shall, accordingly, not tax my mind on that matter.






15.
In the end, I find and hold that the appeal herein has no merit, and is available only for dismissal. I, accordingly, dismiss it. The appellant shall have the costs. It is so ordered.

Ruling










Brief facts


1.
The application for determination is undated and filed on 2
nd
 January 2024 seeking for leave to file his appeal out of time and as a pauper.






2.
The applicant states that he was convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and sentenced to fifteen (15) years imprisonment in Ruiru Criminal Case No. 33 of 2020. The applicant attributes the delay of filing of his appeal late to the inconveniences caused by the challenges in custody.






3.
In opposition to the application, the respondent filed a replying affidavit dated 12
th
 March 2024 and states that the judgment against the applicant was delivered on 30
th
 September 2021 yet the applicant has filed an application for extension in the year 2024, which is two and a half years after the judgment.






4.
The respondent argues that the applicant has not disclosed any good cause to warrant this court to allow the application. Further, the applicant has not accounted for or explained the delay in lodging an appeal against the trial court’s decision.






5.
The respondent states that the applicant has not annexed a petition for appeal which clearly demonstrates that the intended appeal is devoid of any arguable issue.






6.
The respondent argues that the extension of time is not a right of a party but is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court. Further a party who seeks extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court, which the applicant has failed to do. The respondent argues that there are no sufficient reasons for the delay to warrant this court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant.






7.
The applicant filed a Further Affidavit and states that the judgment in the trial court was delivered on 30
th
 September 2021 and he was not served with the judgment despite requesting for it and therefore he was unable to file his appeal on time. The applicant states that he filed a similar application for leave to file an appeal out of time in Kiambu High Court on 25
th
 April 2021 but he did not receive any feedback. He further states that he sent reminders on 21
st
 December 2022 and 3
rd
 March 2023 but did not receive any feedback on whether the appeal was admitted. The applicant states that he then opted to file a fresh application in this court.






8.
The applicant further states that after he was convicted his family members promised to assist him in facilitating his appeal financially but they failed to do so due to financial constraints.






9.
Parties disposed of the application by way of written submissions. Although the applicant stated that he filed his submissions on 16
th
 June 2024, no submissions were received in the case tracking system.








The Respondent’s Submissions


10.
The respondent reiterates what she deponed in her affidavit and submits that the applicant has not annexed any proof to show his efforts if any in procuring the proceedings for the judgment delivered. The applicant has not disclosed any good cause to warrant the court to allow the instant application for leave to lodge an appeal out of time.






11.
The respondent relies on the case of Nicholas Kiptoo arap Korir Salat vs IEBC & 7 Others (2014) eKLR and submits that the applicant has not accounted for or explained the delay in lodging an appeal against the trial court’s decision. Further that the applicant has not sufficiently made out a prima facie case or sufficient cause on the merits to warrant grant of any of the prayers sought in the application. The respondent further submits that the applicant did not annex a copy of the request for certified copies of the proceedings or judgment.








The Law


Whether the applicant has made out a case for the grant of an order for leave to file his appeal out of time.


12.
The court’s power to extend time for filing an appeal is provided for under Section 349 of the Criminal Procedure Code as follows:-
An appeal shall be entered within fourteen days of the date of the order or sentence appealed against.
Provided that the court to which the appeal is made may for good cause admit an appeal after the period of fourteen days has lapsed, and shall so admit an appeal if it is satisfied that the failure to enter the appeal within that period has been caused by the inability of the appellant or his advocate to obtain a copy of the judgment or order appealed against, and a copy of the record, within a reasonable time of applying to the court therefor.






13.
The Supreme Court in the case of Nicholas Kiptoo Korir arap Salat vs IEBC and 7 Others [2014] eKLR enunciated the principles applicable in an application for leave to appeal out of time. The court stated inter alia that:-
“
The underlying principles a court should consider in exercise of such discretion should include:-
a.
Extension of time is not a right of any party. It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court;
b.
A party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court;
c.
Whether the court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made on a case by case basis;
d.
Whether there is a reasonable reason for the delay. The delay should be explained to the satisfaction of the court;
e.
Whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the respondent if the extension is granted;
f.
Whether the application has been brought without undue delay.






14.
The applicant was charged and convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Judgment was delivered on 30
th
 September 2021 and the applicant filed the instant application on 2
nd
 January 2024. The applicant attributes the delay in filing his appeal to financial constraints. The practice of the courts is that criminal appeals are filed and proceedings provided free of charge to convicts. As such, the claim of financial constraints by the applicant does not make sense herein.






15.
Although the applicant did not claim that he ever requested for judgment or the record of proceedings in his affidavit, he raised the issue in his further affidavit and submissions. The applicant submitted that he filed a similar application for leave to file his appeal out of time in the High Court in Kiambu on 25
th
 April 2021 and sent subsequent reminders on 21/12/2022 and 3/3/2023 but he received no feedback.






16.
From the record, there is no proof that the applicant ever filed an application for leave to file an appeal out of time in the High Court in Kiambu. The applicant failed to annex a copy of the request for certified copies of the proceedings and judgment or any reminder sent to the court in Kiambu. I have noted that the applicant brought up the issue of certified proceedings and judgment after the respondent stated so in her replying affidavit and therefore it is my considered view that it is an afterthought. Additionally, 2½ years have lapsed since conviction and the explanation provided for the delay is not satisfactory. Thus, the delay is inordinate and therefore inexcusable.






17.
I have also considered the draft petition of appeal annexed to the application and noted that the intended appeal in my view does not raise any arguable grounds of appeal. Further one of the grounds of appeal is that the trial court did not take into consideration the time the applicant spent in custody pursuant to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is important to note that convict need not file an appeal on such a ground but he may file an application regarding the that particular issue.






18.
It is noted that, the applicant has not provided sufficient reasons for the delay to exercise discretion in his favour. I find no merit in the application filed on 2
nd
 January 2024 and its dismissed accordingly.






19.
It is hereby so ordered.

          (Appeal from judgment and decree of Hon. PA Olengo, Senior Principal Magistrate, SPM, in Busia CMCCC No. 327 of 2019, of 1st April 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant had been sued by the respondent, at the primary court, for compensation arising out of the death of Lucas Omondi Oduor, to be referred hereafter as the deceased, following a road traffic accident on 24
th
 March 2019, along Bunyala-Funyula road. The deceased was a motorcyclist on the said road, and was involved in an accident with motor vehicle registration mark and number KBM 932G, said to have belonged to the appellant, and liability was attributed on the appellant on account of negligence. The appellant filed a defence, denying everything else pleaded in the plaint, and, in the alternative pleading contribution on the part of the deceased.






2.
A trial was conducted. 3 witnesses testified for the respondent, while 2 testified for the appellant. Judgment was delivered on 1
st
 April 2022. On liability, the court held the appellant 100% liable. On quantum, the court awarded Kshs. 20,000.00 for pain and suffering and Kshs. 100,000.00 for loss of expectation of life; Kshs. 1,668,000.00 for loss of dependency; and Kshs. 128,650.00 being special damages; all totalling Kshs. 1,916,650.00.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The appeal has raised several grounds, all revolving around liability.






4.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. Only the appellant filed written submissions. It is submitted that the respondent had not established negligence on the part of the appellant, for the recorded evidence pointed to the deceased, as the one who caused the accident by hitting a stationary vehicle at the rear. The decisions, in Hussein Omar Farah vs. Lento Agencies [2006] eKLR (Omolo, Tunoi & Githinji, JJA), Matunda Fruits Bus Services Ltd vs. Moses Wangila & another [2018] eKLR (J. Ngugi, J) and Eliud Papoi Papa vs. Jigneskumar Rameshbhai Patel & another [2017] eKLR (Meoli, J), are relied upon.






5.
It will be noted that the deceased person, on whose behalf the suit was brought, died after the accident, and before the suit was heard. He was not available to tell his side of the story. The respondent presented an eyewitness, PW2, to recount to the court the events as he saw them. He stated that he was standing along the road, when the accident vehicle overtook the deceased motorcyclist, then applied emergency brakes and stopped, and then the motorcyclist ran into it. He stated that he was the person who took the deceased to hospital. DW1, the appellant, conceded the collision. He stated that he was the driver of the accident vehicle. He said that his motor vehicle was stationary, for he had stopped to drop a passenger, when the motorcycle hit his vehicle, and then he fell on the road.






6.
The accident was conceded by the appellant. There was an incident which involved the deceased and a vehicle belonging to the appellant. There was police evidence of the occurrence of the accident, no doubt, based on the reports made by the parties. The only issue is on negligence. Who was liable for it? The duty was on the respondent, by dint of sections 107 and 108 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80, Laws of Kenya, to establish that that incident was wholly or partially caused by the appellant. The evidence presented by the respondent was that the deceased motorcyclist hit the vehicle from the rear. Under normal circumstances, such a hit, by dint of Multiple Hauliers (EA) Ltd vs. Justus Mutua Malundu & 2 others [2017] eKLR (PJ Otieno, J), would point to negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle hitting the other, on the basis that there is a general “presumption that he who hits another from behind is ipso facto negligent.” The question then to ask is whether the facts of the instant case pointed to negligence on the part of the deceased.






7.
The position stated in Multiple Hauliers (EA) Ltd vs. Justus Mutua Malundu & 2 others [2017] eKLR (PJ Otieno, J), is in the nature of a presumption, which can be displaced by evidence to the contrary. According to the respondent, the accident happened when the appellant suddenly stopped his motor vehicle in front of the deceased’s moving motorcycle, causing the deceased to crash into the motor vehicle. His case appears to be that, although the deceased hit the appellant’s motor vehicle from the rear, the deceased was not to blame for the collision, for the appellant caused the accident by suddenly stopping his motor vehicle in front of the moving motorcycle. The case by the appellant is that he indeed stopped his motor vehicle ahead of the deceased, but he said that he had given an indication of his intention to stop, and put the vehicle aside. He added that another motorcycle, that was ahead of the deceased, passed without incident, but the deceased crashed into the car. Both sides called police witnesses, both of whom had not investigated the accident. One of them produced a police abstract report of the accident, while the other produced an abstract from the police occurrence book. According to DW2, the police officer called by the appellant, the report of the accident was made by the appellant, to effect that he had stopped his motor car and the motorcycle rammed into the vehicle. The witness could not, however, tell the point of impact, from the report that he had.






8.
How did the trial court handle that evidence? The court believed PW2, the eyewitness, on the basis that he was outside, walking along the road, and must have had a clearer view of what happened. It was noted that he was not interested in the matter in anyway, in terms of giving a self-serving statement. It was noted that the appellant, DW1, was inside the vehicle, there was no guarantee that he saw what was happening outside. It was noted that DW2 testified that the appellant overtook the deceased, and suddenly stopped at an undesignated stage, he had failed to indicate his intention to stop, and the rider had no opportunity of avoiding hitting the motor vehicle in question. The trial court had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses testify, and was better placed, compared with the appellate court, to assess their demeanour, and to pass judgment on their credibility.






9.
However, the handling of the testimony of DW2 is a little unsettling, for the analysis, in the judgment, of the purport of his testimony is not in sync with the recorded evidence. What is stated in the analysis is at variance with what is recorded as having been said by the witness.






10.
In the analysis, the trial court states:
“
DW2 clearly indicated how the driver overtook and suddenly stopped to drop a passenger at an undesignated stage. He failed to indicate, he further said that the deceased had an opportunity to avoid hitting the motor vehicle in question.”






11.
When DW2 testified, the trial court recorded him as saying:
“
… The accident involved motor vehicle KBM 932G Toyota Probox and motor cycle KMDM 634A. They were heading the same direction. The motorcycle rammed into the same motorcycle and died on the spot. The pillion passenger got some slight injuries … I am not the investigating officer. The investigating officer was Sgt. Towei. He was based at Funyula Police Station. I was not based at Funyula Police Station. It was reported by the driver of the motor vehicle. He said that he stopped the motor vehicle and the motorcycle rammed into it. It is not clear whether he stopped off or on the road. I can’t tell whether it was off or on the road … The driver stopped to drop somebody. Always they drop somebody off the road.”






12.
There is a sense in which the analysis put words into the mouth of DW2. However, I agree with the assessment by the court, that DW1 was the interested party, and between him and PW2, PW2 was more believable, being a disinterested party. Both witnesses were on common ground, that the car stopped in front of the deceased, whether that happened suddenly, or it had given time and space to the deceased, to manoeuvre to avoid the collision, was what was in dispute. The trial court believed PW2, and held DW1 wholly liable.






13.
However, whereas I agree with the court on the assessment of the evidence on the collision, I am not persuaded that the appellant was wholly to blame. It was negligent of the appellant to overtake the motorcycle, and then, shortly thereafter, brake and stop right in front of it. However, the motorcyclist was expected to keep a proper lookout, to avoid any mishap, such as the prospect of a negligent driver stopping their vehicle suddenly before him. PW2 did not testify on what the deceased did with his motorcycle, upon DW1 stopping his vehicle suddenly before him, other than saying that the motorcycle rammed into the car. There was no statement nor evidence as to whether the deceased made any attempt to swerve or to brake to avoid the collision. See Stanley Ogutu Attai vs. Peter Chege Mbugua [2019] eKLR (Ng’etich, J).






14.
There was evidence of a collision, but there is inadequate evidence of how the collision occurred. The way to go, in such cases, is not to excuse everyone of liability, or to hold only one party accountable, for one or both parties must have contributed to the collision. As it is not possible to assign responsibility, as between the 2, the way out should be to hold both parties liable for the collision. See Platinum Car Hire Limited vs. Samuel Arasa Nyamesi & another [2019] eKLR (Majanja, J). There is a plethora of cases, such as Welch vs. Standard Bank Limited [1970] EA 115 (Madan, J), Lakhamshi vs. Attorney General [1971] EA 118 (Spry VP, Lutta & Mustafa, JJA), Domitila Wangui Karugu & another vs. Dagu Hidris Haide [2020] eKLR (Majanja, J), Kahindi Kifaru Chengo (legal representative of the deceased of the Estate Baraka Kahindi Kifaru (Deceased) vs. Auto Industries Limited & another [2020] eKLR (Nyakundi, J), Amani Kazungu Karema vs. Jackmash Auto Ltd & another [2021] eKLR (Nyakundi, J) and Ndatho vs. Chebet [2022] KEHC 346 (KLR)(Gitari, J), where that principle is stated. It should be of application here. A collision happened between the deceased and the vehicle belonging to the appellant, something conceded by the appellant, in the evidence he adduced in court. The evidence adduced by both sides was not conclusive on who was to blame, and, in such case, the trial court should have concluded that both parties were equally to blame for it, and assessed liability at 50%:50%.






15.
In the end, I find merit in the appeal, to the limited extent discussed in paragraph 
14
 hereabove, and I hereby allow it, to that limited extent. The effect shall be that the judgment of the trial court, on liability, at 100% against the appellant, is hereby set aside, and substituted with an order that the 2 sides share liability at 50%:50%. The appeal is disposed of in those terms. The other aspects of the judgment of the trial court shall remain intact. Each party shall bear their own costs.

 Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from the judgment of Hon. DS Aswani, Adjudicator/Resident Magistrate, RM, delivered on 24th June 2022, in Nairobi SCCC No. 1003 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the 1
st
 respondent, against the appellant, for a sum of Kshs. 833,165.00, in respect of goods supplied but not paid for. The appellant filed a defence, in which it denied that the goods were supplied to it, and, at the same time, pleading that the debt had been settled, but the 1
st
 respondent had not paid Value Added Tax (VAT) in respect of the amount paid. The appellant pleaded that the amount it paid for the goods was induced by the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, who it named as third parties. The 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, appeared as third parties, and denied liability, and accused the appellant of fraud.






2.
A formal hearing was conducted, on 10
th
 May 2022, when 1 witness each testified for the appellant, 1
st
 respondent, and the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents. Judgment was delivered on 24
th
 June 2022, in favour of the 1
st
 respondent.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 22
nd
 July 2022, turn on the trial court failing to appreciate that the suit was by an unpaid seller, under section 31 of the 
Sale of Goods Act
, Cap 31, Laws of Kenya; failing to apply sections 32(2) and 39 of the 
Sale of Goods Act
, and especially whether the contract of sale, and the breach, was in respect to a sale where the price was to be settled by the stated instalment of Kshs. 833,165.00 or to be paid for separately, and whether the contract was in relation to the whole of Kshs. 2,919,415.00 as pleaded in the defence; failing to find and hold that the only contract of sale related to the whole of Kshs. 2,919,415.00 as pleaded in the defence; failing to find that the respondent had not pleaded a claim arising out of a contract whose whole price was Kshs. 3,752,580.02; erring in finding that the claim was a balance of the purchase price in a contract whose sale price was Kshs. 3,752,580.02 in the absence of any pleading to that effect in terms of section 39 of the 
Sale of Goods Act
; and failed to uphold or sustain the unchallenged defence by the appellant that the claim was unlawful and unmaintainable for the respondent had billed and collected tax from the appellant.






4.
Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were given on 20
th
 December 2023, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. The file of papers before me has written submissions on the appeal by the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents. I have not come across written submissions by the appellant.






5.
The 1
st
 respondent only argues 1 substantial issue, whether the appellant was entitled to the reliefs sought in the memorandum of appeal. It argues that some of the issues raised in the appeal were either admitted by the appellant, while the others did not arise at the trial . On the first batch of issues, it is submitted that the claim was for Kshs. 833,165.00, and it emerged at the hearing that the same was a balance from an amount of Kshs. 3,752,580.02, out of which Kshs. 2,919,415.00 had been paid. It is submitted that the contract was admitted, and so was the partial payment of Kshs. 2,919,415.00, and it is argued that the fact that the 1
st
 respondent did not plead that it had been paid Kshs. 2,919,415.00 was not fatal. It is submitted that the appellant had acknowledged that the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents had authority at all times to act on behalf of the appellant, and that they ran the business of the appellant, as managing directors and shareholders. It cites Emco Plastic International Ltd vs. Freeberne [1971] EA 42 (Lutta, Law & Mustafa, JJA), to support their case. On the second batch of issues, it is submitted that they suggest that the respondents herein colluded to defraud the appellant, which is a new issue, that was not canvassed at the trial. It is submitted that it never came up at trial, it was not discussed and no evidence was led on it, and it should not arise on appeal. Republic vs. Tribunal of Inquiry to Investigate the Conduct of Tom Mbaluto & others ex parte Tom Mbaluto [2018] eKLR (Makhandia, Kiage & M’Inoti, JJA) is cited in support.






6.
On their part, the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents argue on the grounds that touch on them, the 2 relating to collusion between them and the 1
st
 respondent. They rely on Order 2 rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which require a party who alleges fraud, to specifically plead the said fraud in its pleadings. They submit that it was the appellant who dragged them into the suit, and it merely alleged that they did not disclose to it the debts owed to the 1
st
 respondent, and the third party notices, served on them, did not raise questions of fraud or collusion between them and the 1
st
 respondent. They cite Urmila w/o Mahendra Shah vs. Barclays Bank International Ltd & another [1979]eKLR [1976-1980] 1 KLR 1168 (Madan, Wambuzi & Law, JJA), on standard of proof of fraud in civil matters. They submit that no evidence was adduced on the alleged collusion or fraud.






7.
The appeal turns around only 2 issues; whether there was a contract, and whether there was collusion between or fraud by the respondents.






8.
On the first issue, the appellant denied the existence of the contract, and suggested that there was collusion between the 1
st
 respondent and the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents to defraud it. The 1
st
 respondent produced invoices and delivery notes, to support its claim that it supplied the goods in question. That was conceded by the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, who were running the business of the appellant, that goods were supplied, and part payment was made. However, the appellant alleged or suggested that that transaction did not involve it, for the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents acted in their personal capacities, with respect to their own personal affairs, and not that of the appellant. The appellant did not offer any evidence that established that the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents dealt with the appellant in their personal capacities, or that the goods were ordered as such, and were supplied to them in those personal capacities. The trial court noted that the invoices and delivery notes were in the name of the appellant. The court also noted that the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents run the business of the appellant, and the 3
rd
 respondent detailed to the trial court, in his testimony, how RW1, the witness for the appellant, would approve the payments that were made to the 1
st
 respondent. The trial court had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses who appeared and testified before it, and was best placed to make assessments on their credibility and reliability as witnesses..






9.
There was an issue raised by the appellant, in its response, and written submissions at the trial, about tax, the allegation that the 1
st
 respondent billed it and illegally collected tax from it, which it did not release to the Kenya Revenue Authority, which made the sales contract illegal. The appellant has raised the tax matter as an issue in the appeal. However, I note that RW1 did not make any reference to that issue in his witness statement, dated 9
th
 May 2022, which he adopted at trial, neither did he testify on it when he gave oral evidence on 10
th
 May 2022. The issue was argued in the written submissions. An allegation made in a pleading, is not evidence, and is of no evidential value, until some facts are placed before the court at the trial, to support the allegation. That never happened in this case. The allegation about the tax, allegedly illegally collected by the 1
st
 respondent, from the appellant, remained just that, an allegation in the pleadings, which was not supported by any of the facts that the appellant placed before the trial court to support its case. The trial court did not have to rule on it, and, quite properly, made no reference to it in its decision. Similarly, written submissions are not evidence. They are supposed to be an analysis of the pleadings and the evidence, weighed against the applicable law, essentially an argument advanced of the case by the party. Submissions are based on the evidence, they cannot, therefore, be the evidence.






10.
The appellant has raised issue about certain provisions of the 
Sale of Goods Act
, and argues that the trial court did not take them into account. I note from the response filed by the appellant, to the claim at the trial court, that the appellant did not raise any issue about those provisions of the 
Sale of Goods Act
; neither did it make arguments around these provisions of the 
Sale of Goods Act
 in its written submissions at the trial. Its witness did not mention the 
Sale of Goods Act
 in his written witness statement and his oral testimony. The 
sale of Goods Act
 was not made an issue at the trial; it cannot be made one now.






11.
The appellant has also raised issue, in the grounds of appeal, about whether the contract was for Kshs. 833,165.00, or Kshs. 2,919,415.00, or Kshs. 3,752,580.02. The pleadings, by the 1
st
 respondent, limited its claim to Kshs. 833,165.00. It was the appellant who introduced the sum of Kshs. 2,919,415.00, stating that that that was the amount that it had paid to the 1
st
 respondent. The 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents then explained that the contract was actually for Kshs. 3,752,580.02, out of which Kshs. 2,919,415.00 was paid, leaving a balance of Kshs. 833,165.00. The pleadings by the 1
st
 respondent could, perhaps, have been done more neatly, but the other parties, including the appellant, filled in the gaps in them, in their responding pleadings. Nothing really should turn on this, given that it was an issue that remained in the pleadings. RW1, the witness for the appellant did not address it in his written witness statement, nor in his oral testimony. It was, therefore, not addressed in the evidence that the appellant presented at the trial. It cannot now be made an issue on appeal. The same would apply to whether the contractual amount was to be paid in lumpsum or in instalments.






12.
From the material before me, I am not persuaded that the trial court came to the wrong conclusions, on the existence of the contract the subject of the trial.






13.
On the second batch of issues, the alleged collusion between the respondents, to defraud the appellant, I note, from the response filed by the appellant, to the claim by the 1
st
 respondent, that the appellant did not allege collusion between or fraud by the respondents. Similarly, the third party notices issued to the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, by the appellant, dated 18
th
 March 2022, made no allegation of fraud by or collusion between the respondents, neither were the acts of fraud particularised. The law on particularisation of acts of fraud, where fraud and collusion are alleged, is well settled in such cases as Urmila w/o Mahendra Shah vs. Barclays Bank International Ltd & another [1979]eKLR [1976-1980] 1 KLR 1168 (Madan, Wambuzi & Law, JJA). I have very keenly perused the testimony of RW1, the witness presented for the appellant, and I have been unable to find any evidence which supports the allegation of fraud and collusion by and between the respondents.






14.
Overall, I find no merit in the appeal herein, and I hereby dismiss it with costs. It is so ordered.

Between




Maworks Investment Company Limited


 


Appellant




and




Albert Mwilitsa


 


Respondent







        
          (An appeal arising from the judgment of Hon. Brenda Jaluha Ofisi, Senior Resident Magistrate, SRM, Adjudicator, delivered on 29th July 2022, in Nairobi SCC Com. No. E2723 of 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The suit, at the primary court, was initiated by the respondent, against the appellant, for a sum of Kshs. 180,000.00, being, allegedly, a deposit made by the respondent, to the appellant, for hotel space, which was immediately closed, in compliance with Government directives, in the effort to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The appellant filed a response, in which it pleaded that the money was indeed paid, as part deposit and part rent, on the basis of a lease agreement, whereupon the respondent took possession, and commenced the business of a restaurant, which he subsequently terminated without notice to the appellant. It was denied that the arrangement was frustrated by the Government efforts towards containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was averred that part of the money was spent as rent for part of the period that the respondent was in occupation, and the rest, the deposit component, covered the rent for the remainder of the period, for which rent had not been paid.






2.
A formal hearing was conducted, on 4
th
 July 2022, where 2 witnesses testified, 1 each for the appellant and the respondent. Judgment was delivered on 29
th
 July 2022. The claim was partially allowed, so that ½ of the money deposited was ordered to be reimbursed, on the basis that it was a component of the deposit on rent.






3.
The appellants were aggrieved, hence the instant appeal. The grounds, in the memorandum of appeal, dated 25
th
 August 2022, revolve around the trial court concluding that the respondent did not move out of the let premises, when the evidence on record was to the contrary; the trial court concluding that the appellant terminated the lease without notice, when it was the respondent who voluntarily moved out of the premises; and the trial court allowing the claim, when it was not supported by evidence.






4.
Directions, on the disposal of the appeal, were given, on 20
th
 December 2023. I see written submissions on the file, by the appellant, but I have not found any by the respondent.






5.
The appellant has argued the appeal from 2 standpoints, the first on jurisdiction and the second on misapplication of the law to the facts by the trial court. On jurisdiction, it cites the decision in 
Christoffersen vs. Kavneet Kaur Sehmi t/a The Random Shop Nairobi HCCA No. E036 of 2022
, reported as Christoffersen vs. Kavneet Kaur Sehmi t/a The Random Shop [2022] KEHC 14035 (KLR)(Majanja, J), where it was found and held that the Small Claims Court lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine a landlord-tenant dispute over rent arrears. On the second aspect, it is submitted that the conclusion, that the respondent closed the restaurant business, but did not move out of the premises, was not supported by the evidence adduced.






6.
The primary issue for determination is jurisdiction of the trial court, whether the trial court properly analysed the evidence is secondary.






7.
Jurisdiction is at the core of any litigation. See Adero Adero & another vs. Ulinzi Sacco Limited [2002] eKLR (Ringera, J) and Joseph Njuguna Mwaura & 2 others vs. Republic [2013] eKLR (Mwera, Warsame, Kiage, Gatembu & J. Mohammed, JJA). A court or tribunal can only entertain matters that fall within its jurisdiction, which is conferred by the law, that is 
the Constitution
 and statute. See In the Matter of Interim Independent Electoral Commission [2011] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Baraza DCJ, Tunoi, Ibrahim, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ) and Kibos Distillers Limited vs. Benson Ambuti Adega & 3 others [2020] eKLR (Makhandia, Kiage & Odek, JJA). It cannot be conferred by judicial craft, in terms of the court arrogating to itself jurisdiction, where 
the Constitution
 and the statute have not so vested it, or by consent of the parties. See Samuel Kamau Macharia & another vs. Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 2 others [2012] eKLR (Mutunga CJ, Tunoi, Ojwang, Wanjala & Ndung’u, SCJJ) and Equity Bank Limited vs. Bruce Mutie Mutuku t/a Diani Tour Travel [2016] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA). Where a court finds itself bereft of jurisdiction, over a matter that it is seized of, it should down its tools, for it ought not take any further step in the matter, for the very reason of lack of jurisdiction. See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA).






8.
Since jurisdiction goes to the core or heart, or is at the centre, of the matter, issues around it can be raised and determined at any stage of the proceedings, and in any manner. See Kenya Ports Authority vs. Modern Holdings (EA) Limited [2017] eKLR (Makhandia, Ouko & M’Inoti, JJA). It can be raised in the pleadings, or during trial, or by way of preliminary objection on a point of law, or through an application, whether orally or in writing. It can be raised by either party or by the court on its own motion. The court can address it in its judgment, at the tail-end of the trial, regardless of whether any of the parties had raised it, whether in their pleadings or in the course of the trial. It does not have to be raised as, or made, an issue at the trial, for the court to consider it. It is so central to the validity, authenticity and competence of the proceedings that the court can entertain and determine it at any stage of the proceedings. Because of its centrality, it can be prioritised, and disposed of as a preliminary issue, after stopping the proceedings temporarily to address it. See Owners and Masters of the Motor Vessel “Joev” vs. Owners and Masters of the Motor Tugs “Barbara” and “Steve B” [2008] 1 EA 367. Where it is established that the trial court is bereft of jurisdiction, the proceedings ought to be halted, regardless of the stage at which they are at. See Owners of the Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR (Nyarangi, Masime & Kwach, JJA).






9.
The principal issue is about jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, where the claim at the trial court was initiated. The statute which vests the Small Claims Court with jurisdiction is the 
Small Claims Court Act
, Cap 10A, Laws of Kenya. That vesting is through section 12 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, which confers jurisdiction on that court to determine civil claims relating to contracts for sale, supply of goods and services, and money held and received; liability in tort in respect of loss or damage caused to any property, or for delivery, or recovery of moveable property; compensation for personal injuries; and set off and counterclaim under any contract. The claim by the respondent was for money held and received.






10.
The trial court took evidence, and it would appear that the issue of jurisdiction was not raised by either party, neither did the trial court consider it, in its judgment.






11.
Was there jurisdiction on the part of the trial court? According to the statement of claim, the cause was about recovery of rent deposited, for hotel space, which hotel was, allegedly, immediately closed on account of Government Covid-19 containment measures. It was not about a hotel really, but a restaurant, or eatery, or catering establishment. The appellant, in his response, did not contest, receipt of the money, which he said in part covered rent and part deposit on rent. The appellant also averred that the respondent took possession, operated a restaurant business on the premises, before moving out, after expressing an intent to. According to the appellant, the parties had entered into a lease agreement, on 8
th
 January 2021, and the respondent expressed an intention to stop operations on 29
th
 March 2021. At the oral hearing, the respondent testified that the appellant was his landlord, and that he was seeking refund of the money pleaded in his claim. He said that he was unable to conduct business, as from 6
th
 January 2021, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. He denied ever moving into the premises. He, however, clarified that the appellant did not prevent him from accessing the same. He stated that notice, to terminate tenancy, was a prerequisite, under the lease/tenancy agreement, but he did not give one. The witness for the appellant stated that the appellant did not ask the respondent to vacate, but that he had received an intimation indicating that the respondent wished to vacate. In the judgment, the trial court acknowledged the tenancy agreement, and went on to conclude that the appellant was entitled to retain half of the money received as rent, but the other half ought to be treated as deposit on rent, which was refundable.






12.
The dispute before the trial court was purely within the realm of a landlord-tenant relationship. That relationship is governed by its own law, and disputes around it, inclusive of any on rent, should be resolved in accordance with the landlord-tenant law. In short, the landlord-tenant relationship is a specialised area, governed by its own law, specific to that sector. There are laws and statutes that govern it, which set out processes for resolving any disputes in that space. It is a land law issue, governed by legislation relating to land, such as the 
Land Registration Act
, Cap 300, Laws of Kenya, and the 
Land Act
, Cap 280, Laws of Kenya, which deal with the rights and obligations of parties to a lease agreement. The courts, with jurisdiction to deal with disputes within that realm, are the Environment and Land Court and any enabled subordinate courts, by virtue of sections 2 and 101 of the 
Land Registration Act
 and sections 2 and 150 of the 
Land Act
. For lease or tenancy agreements relating to certain premises, occupied for residential or commercial purposes, special tribunals have been established under the 
Rent Restriction Act
, Cap 296, Laws of Kenya, and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, Cap 301, Laws of Kenya, being the Rent Restriction Tribunal and the Business Premises Tribunal, respectively. Appeals, from the tribunals envisaged under the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, lie with the Environment and Land Court, by virtue of section 8 of the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and section 15 of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
. Quite clearly, from the above discussion, jurisdiction over disputes between landlords and tenants, relating to rent, is vested in the courts specified in the 
Land Registration Act
 and the 
Land Act
, and the specialised tribunals established under the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
.






13.
The Small Claims Court is vested with jurisdiction over small claims. Its jurisdiction is defined in section 12 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, as covering contracts for sale and supply of goods or services, and relating to money held and received; set-off and counterclaim under any contract; compensation for personal injuries; and liability in tort in respect of loss or damage caused to any property or for the delivery or recovery of movable property. The 
Small Claims Court Act
, and in particular its section 12, is not to be read in isolation of other laws or legislation. Indeed, section 12(1) is specific, that the jurisdiction conferred under it, is subject to “any other law.” So, it ought to be read together with the provisions in the 
Land Registration Act
, the 
Land Act
, the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, with respect to claims touching on rent. Section 12 of the Small Claims Act does not override the provisions in those other statutes, on landlord-tenant disputes, and it does not oust the jurisdictions conferred on the specialised courts and tribunals, over such disputes, in those statutes. Section 12 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 should give way to the provisions in those other statutes.






14.
For avoidance of doubt, section 12(1) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 says:
“
Nature of claims and pecuniary jurisdiction
(1)
Subject to this Act, the Rules and any other law, the Court has jurisdiction to determine any civil claim relating to—
(a)
a contract for sale and supply of goods or services;
(b)
a contract relating to money held and received;
c)
liability in tort in respect of loss or damage caused to any property or for the delivery or recovery of movable property;
(d)
compensation for personal injuries; and
(e)
set-off and counterclaim under any contract.
(2)
…”






15.
It would appear, from the wording or language of section 12(1) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, that the Small Claims Court is not designed to handle disputes relating to land and land related-issues. For example, the disputes around contracts, that it is designed to handle, relate to sale of goods and services, not land. Liability, relating to recovery of property, is limited to movable, and not immovable, property. The construction, that should be given to section 12(1) of the 
Small Claims Court Act
, therefore, ought to be that that court is not meant to handle disputes that have anything to do with or relate to land, so long as such disputes are subject to jurisdiction of specialised courts and tribunals, established under dedicated legislation, relating to land and related matters. See Palms Resort Limited vs. Qureshi & 2 others [2023] KEHC 23644 (KLR) (Magare, J).






16.
It is my finding and holding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to handle the dispute that was before it, for the same fell within the jurisdiction of the specialised courts and tribunals envisaged in the 
Land Registration Act
, the 
Land Act
, the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
. From the pleadings, it would be clear that the parties raised issues about taking of possession or occupation of rented premises, payment of rent and deposit on rent, issuance of notice to terminate tenancy, and payment of an amount equivalent to monthly rent in lieu, among others, all of which are issues that are peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the specialised courts and tribunals envisaged under the 
Land Registration Act
, the 
Land Act
, the 
Rent Restriction Act
 and the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, and not the court established under the 
Small Claims Court Act
.






17.
In Christoffersen vs. Kavneet Kaur Sehmi t/a The Random Shop [2022] KEHC 14035 (KLR)(Majanja, J), the issue of the jurisdiction of the High Court, with respect to handling appeals from the Small Claims Court, which turn on rent, arose, and the court ruled that under the 
Small Claims Court Act
, it was the High Court with jurisdiction to handle appeals from the Small Claims Court. In any case, the court went on, the claim was for money held and received, being rent arrears, but there was no jurisdiction in the Small Claims Court, for the tenant held no money, as she was in arrears. That then meant that the High Court decided the matter on the basis of jurisdiction, rather than the merits, turning around whether the tenant was in rent arrears. Likewise, the appellant herein has addressed the matter of jurisdiction of the High Court over this appeal, given that it is about rent. Obviously, where the issue, to be addressed on appeal, would turn on matters uniquely land, like rental income from landed assets, there would be no jurisdiction. If I were to determine the appeal on merits, in terms of assessing whether the facts disclosed a landlord-tenant relationship, the validity of any lease or tenancy agreement the basis of that landlord-tenancy relationship, whether a proper termination notice was given, how funds deposited as rent were to be applied, among others, I would be acting outside of jurisdiction. Of course, the matter at the trial court turned on those issues, and any challenge to the decision of that, based on those facts, on appeal, ought to be placed before the Environment and Land Court. I have only dealt with jurisdiction, and, I believe, there would be jurisdiction for me to do so.






18.
As I have concluded that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the matter, it should then follow that there was no basis for it to take evidence, and the exercise that it undertook, of receiving evidence, and analysing it, was needless. There would be no foundation for me, similarly, to evaluate whether the analysis undertaken was reasonable, or accorded with the law. In any event, an analysis of that evidence would take me outside of jurisdiction, into a realm that falls within the mandate of another court, which 
the Constitution
 has forbidden me, sitting as the High Court, from venturing into.






19.
In view of everything said above, I will allow the appeal, not on the grounds detailed in the memorandum of appeal, but on account of lack of jurisdiction, on the part of the trial court. The effect, of allowing the appeal, is that the final order, made in the judgment of 29
th
 July 2022, is hereby set-aside, and substituted with an order striking out the claim at the trial court. I shall make no order on costs. It is so ordered.

Introduction


1.
By a Notice of Motion application dated 18
th
 July 2023, the Petitioner herein seeks orders that:
i.
Spent.
ii.
The Court be pleased to certify the instant Petition as raising substantial questions of law under Article 165 sub-clause (3) (b) and (d) of 
the Constitution
 and to transfer the file to the Chief Justice for empanelment of a bench of an uneven number of Judges to hear and determine the same.
iii.
Pending the hearing and determination of this application an Order be issued summoning the Inspector-General of the Police and the official convener of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition protests, the Hon. Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya, to this Court for purposes of accounting to the Court the cause of the impasse in order that it may give appropriate directions in keeping with its authority under Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
 and the right to assembly under Article 37 of 
the Constitution
.
iv.
Pending the hearing and determination of the Petition herein an Order be issued summoning the Inspector-General of the Police and the official convener of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition protests, the Hon. Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya, to this Court for purposes of accounting to the Court the cause of the impasse in order that it may give appropriate directions in keeping with its authority under Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
 and the right to assembly under Article 37 of 
the Constitution
.
v.
Any other Order that the Court deems fit and just.
vi.
The costs of this application be provided for.






2.
During the Court proceedings, the Petitioner informed the Court that it had abandoned Prayers 3 and 4 in the application for the reason that they had been overtaken by events. As a result, the Petitioner only seeks to proceed with Prayer 2 herein above.








Petitioner’s Case


3.
The application is supported by the Petitioner’s affidavit of even date and grounds on the face of the application.






4.
According to the Petitioner, the Petition which broadly seeks to address the right to assembly, demonstrate, picket and petition under Article 37 of 
the Constitution
 on one hand and police power in administration of such protests on the other hand, raises a number of substantial questions of law that require the Court’s determination. He sets out these issues as follows:
a.
What is the role of the President of the Republic of Kenya vis-à-vis that of the Inspector-General of the Police in matters internal security.
b.
The delineation of the roles of the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government vis-à-vis that of the Inspector-General of the Police in critical matters of internal security.
c.
Where, amongst the aforementioned offices does the buck stop in terms of deep internal security crises.
d.
Whether or not there has been a systematic and unjustifiable limitation by the State on Kenyans’ right to assembly, demonstration, picketing and petition under Article 37 of 
the Constitution
.;
e.
Who, between the National Police Service and the demonstrators bears the biggest responsibility for safety and peace during demonstrations and assemblies.
f.
Whether the 
National Police Service Act
 and the National Police Service Standing Order and its operational manuals as enacted are effectively checking on the perpetual vice of the excessive use of force by the Police.






5.
He asserts in view of this, that the matters raised in the Petition present weighty and substantial questions of law that Wanjiku grapples with. This is with reference to their ability to live a life of dignity and safety in Kenya. For that reason and the great public interest therein, the Petitioner is certain that his application is justified and thus should be allowed.








1
st
 Respondent’s Case


6.
In response, the 1
st
 Respondent in opposition to both the Petition and application filed grounds of opposition dated 14
th
 September 2023 on the premise that:
i.
The Petitioner’s Petition on declarations on Section 5 of the 
Public Order Act
 is frivolous and abuse of the process of court by dint of the principle of Res Judicata since was dealt with in Nairobi Civil Appeal No. 261 of 2018 Haki na Sheria Initiative Vs. IG Police & 3 Others (2020) eKLR and Nairobi Civil Appeal No. 1 of 2015 Hussein Khalid & 16 Others Vs Attorney General & 2 Others (2017) eKLR.
ii.
Article 24 (1)(d) of 
the Constitution
 is clear that certain rights or fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights may be limited to ensure that the enjoyment of rights and fundamental freedoms by any individual does not prejudice the rights and fundamental freedoms of others.
iii.
The Petitioner’s allegation that there was no public participation in the enactment of the National Police Standing Orders, 
Legal Notice No. 100 of 2017
 and its accompanying Operational Manual is a matter of fact that must be proved by adducing evidence.
iv.
A declaration cannot be used to curtail or stop public officers from lawful exercise of power within their statutory mandates as stipulated under Chapter 14 of 
the Constitution
 (Article 240) and Section 4 of the 
National Security Council Act
 No 23 0f 2012.
v.
The application of the precautionary principle is not absolute and can be subject to exceptions based on the specific circumstances of each case as seen in Kenya Association of Manufacturers & 2 others v Cabinet Secretary - Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources & 3 others (2017) eKLR.
vi.
The allegation by the Petitioner on the use of tear gas as a crowd control method lies bare, with no scientific evidence or findings to support the same.
vii.
Seeking to direct the police on the methods for crowd control, would be a blatant infringement on the exercise of police independent professional discretion in the discharge of their duties contrary to the dictates of 
the Constitution
.
viii.
The Petition is bad in law, mischievous, misconceived and made for selfish ulterior motives thus should be dismissed with costs to the Respondents.

 Respondents’ and Interested Parties Case


7.
These parties did not file any response to the application.








Petitioner’s Submissions


8.
On 19
th
 January 2024, Arende Oriri & Associates Advocates filed submissions in support of the application. Counsel relying in Maina Kiai & 2 others vs Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & another (2016) eKLR submitted that what constitutes a substantial question of law has not been defined in 
the Constitution
 hence it is left to the Judge to satisfy himself or herself that the matter is substantial to the extent that it warrants reference to the Chief Justice. As such the Court in 
Okiya Omtatah Okoiti and another vs President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and 4 Others, Petition No. 531 of 2015
 observed as follows:
“
The different approaches taken by the High Court as shown above would make it clear that whether a substantive question of law arises under 165(4) is dependent on the circumstances of a particular case. Furthermore, that the list of relevant factors is not exhaustive and that the presence or absence of one is not necessarily decisive in a particular case. Ultimately, the presiding judge has to exercise his or her discretion on whether, on his or her appraisal of the factual and legal matrix, a substantial question of law arises.”






9.
Similar reliance in this regard was placed in Martin Nyaga and Others vs Speaker County Assembly of Embu and 4 Others and Amicus (2014) eKLR.






10.
Counsel in light of this argued that the Petition’s effect is far reaching as seeks to cause changes to significant parts of our democratic system being: the conduct of the police and in particular regard to the lawful use of force and firearms; a sense of orderliness in the Republic in matters division of roles amongst key state offices in as far as matter internal security is concerned and to have a more peaceful, organized and least destructive culture of demonstrations, pickets, petitions and assemblies in the country. Consequently, Counsel emphasized that these pertinent issues warrant grant of the order sought in the instant application.








1
st
 Respondent’s Submissions


11.
Counsel Jackline Kiramana in the submissions dated 18
th
 October 2023, submitted that a substantial question of law in view of Article 165(4) of 
the Constitution
 was discussed in J. Harrison Kinyanjui vs Attorney General & Another (2012) eKLR as follows:
“
The Constitution
 of Kenya does not define, „substantial question of law.? It is left to the individual judge to satisfy himself or herself that the matter is substantial to the extent that it warrants reference to the Chief Justice to appoint an uneven number of judges not being less than three to determine the matter…Therefore, giving meaning to “substantial question” must take into account the provisions of 
the Constitution
 as a whole and need to dispense justice without delay particularly given a specific fact situation.”






12.
These sentiments were also echoed in Wycliff Ambetsa Oparanya & 2 Others vs Director of Public Prosecutions and 7 others (2016) eKLR which was also cited in support.






13.
Ms. Kiramana further submitted that the Supreme Court of India in Chunilal vs. Mehta vs Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. AIR 1962 SC 1314 and Santosh Hazari vs. Purushottam Tiwari (2001) 3 SCC 179 in answering what a substantial question is set out the elements to be considered as follows:
“
a)
Whether, directly or indirectly, it affects substantial rights of the parties.
b)
Whether the question is of general public importance.
c)
Whether it is an open question, in the sense that the issue has not been settled by pronouncement of the Supreme Court or the Privy Council or by the Federal Court.
d)
The issue is not free from difficulty.
e)
It calls for a discussion for alternative view.”






14.
Consequently, Ms. Kiramana submitted that the issues raised in the Petition are not novel and been dealt with extensively such as the question of constitutionality of a statute. Further she argued that although public interest can be considered as a substantial issue, the same is not a necessarily decisive factor in determining a substantial question of law as held in 
County Government of Meru vs the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Milimani Law Courts Petition No. 177 of 2014
.As a consequence, it is asserted that the Petitioner’s application has not met the threshold of a substantial question and hence does not require empanelment of an uneven Judge bench to be determined.








Analysis and Determination


15.
The only issue that arises for determination is:
Whether the Petition dated 18
th
 July 2023 raises substantial questions of law meriting certification before the Chief Justice for the empanelment of an uneven Judge bench.






16.
Article 165 (4) of 
the Constitution
 makes provision that serves as a general guide on matters concerning empanelment of a bench. It provides as follows:
Any matter certified by the court as raising a substantial question of law under clause (3) (b) or (d) shall be heard by an uneven number of judges, being not less than three, assigned by the Chief Justice.






17.
Article 165 (3) (b) or (d) of 
the Constitution
 which are mentioned in Article 165 (4) the ones that may possibly yield substantial issues that could call for composition of a bench and state as follows:
(3)
Subject to clause (5), the High Court shall have--
a.
…..
b.
jurisdiction to determine the question whether a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, infringed or threatened;
c.
…….
d.
jurisdiction to hear any question respecting the interpretation of this Constitution including the determination of—
i.
the question whether any law is inconsistent with or in contravention of this Constitution;
(ii)
the question whether anything said to be done under the authority of this Constitution or of any law is inconsistent with, or in contravention of, this Constitution;
(iii)
any matter relating to constitutional powers of State organs in respect of county governments and any matter relating to the constitutional relationship between the levels of government; and
(iv)
a question relating to conflict of laws under Article 191; and
(e)
…….






18.
As was ably submitted by the parties, the phrase ‘substantial question of law’ is not defined in 
the Constitution
. Court have however given meaning to the same in various judicial precedents. In the case of Harrison Kinyanjui (supra) the Court opined as follows:
“


8.
Therefore, giving meaning to “substantial question” must take into account the provisions of 
the Constitution
 as a whole and need to dispense justice without delay particularly given a specific fact situation. In other words, each case must be considered on its merits by the judge certifying the matter. It must also be remembered that each High Court judge, has authority under Article 165 of 
the Constitution
, to determine any matter that is within the jurisdiction of the High Court. Further, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 165(4), the decision of a three Judge bench is of equal force to that of a single judge exercising the same jurisdiction. A single judge deciding a matter is not obliged to follow a decision of the court delivered by three judges.”








19.
The Court went on to note that:
“


10.
A matter may raise complex issues of fact and law but this does not necessarily imply that the matter is one that raises substantial issues of law. Judges are from time to time required to determine complex issues yet one cannot argue that it means that every issue is one that raises substantial questions of law. Thus, there must be something more to the “substantial question” than merely novelty or complexity of the issue before the court. It may present unique facts not plainly covered by the controlling precedents. It may also involve important questions concerning the scope and meaning of decisions of the higher courts or the application of well-settled principles to the facts of a case.”








20.
Likewise, the Court in Philomena Mbete Mwilu vs Director of Public Prosecution & 4 Others (2018) eKLR observed as follows:
“


24.
……a question of law would be a substantial question of law if it directly or indirectly affects the rights of parties; there is some doubt or difference of opinion on the issues raised and that the issue is capable of generating different interpretations. If however the question has been well settled by the highest court or the general principles to be applied in determining the question before court have been well-settled, the mere application of those principles to a new set of facts presented in a case before the court would not on their own constitute a substantial question of law. There must be the possibility of the matter attracting different interpretations or opinion in its interpretation or application of the principles espoused in the matter to make it a substantial question of law. All this notwithstanding, it is up to the individual judge to decide whether the matter raises a substantial question of law for purposes of reference.”








21.
The Court of Appeal in Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & Another vs Anne Waiguru –Cabinet Secretary, Devolution and Planning and 3 Others (2017) eKLR set out the principles to be applied when considering such an application. The Court opined as follows:
“


42.
There are, in our view, parallels to be drawn between certification for purposes Article 163(4)(b) of 
the Constitution
 and certification for purposes of Article 165(4) notwithstanding that the drafters of 
the Constitution
, in providing for certification of matters for purposes of appeal to the Supreme Court under Article 163(4)(b) stipulated that a matter should be of “general public importance”, The word, “substantial” in its ordinary meaning, means “of considerable importance”. There is therefore wisdom to be gained from the pronouncements of the Supreme Court of Kenya respecting interpretation of Article 163(4)(b). In Hermanus Phillipus Steyn v Giovanni Gnechi- Ruscone [2013] eKLR the Supreme Court of Kenya pronounced governing principles for purposes of certification under Article 163(4)(b) some of which are relevant in the context of certification under Article 165(4). Drawing therefrom, we adopt, with modification, the following principles:
“(i)
For a case to be certified as one involving a substantial point of law, the intending applicant must satisfy the Court that the issue to be canvassed is one the determination of which affects the parties and transcends the circumstances of the particular case and has a significant bearing on the public interest;
(ii)
The applicant must show that there is a state of uncertainty in the law;
(iii)
The matter to be certified must fall within the terms of Article 165 (3)(b) or (d) of 
the Constitution
;
(vi)
The applicant has an obligation to identify and concisely set out the specific substantial question or questions of law which he or she attributes to the matter for which the certification is sought.”






43.
It is our judgment therefore, that whether a matter raises a substantial point of law for purposes of Article 165(4) of 
the Constitution
 is a matter for determination on a case-by-case basis. The categories of factors that should be taken into account in arriving at that decision cannot be closed.”








22.
I have looked at the issues raised by the Petitioner/Applicant which are: What is the role of the President of the Republic of Kenya vis-à-vis that of the Inspector-General of the Police in matters internal security; The delineation of the roles of the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government vis-à-vis that of the Inspector-General of the Police in critical matters of internal security; Where, amongst the aforementioned offices does the buck stop in terms of deep internal security crises; Whether or not there has been a systematic and unjustifiable limitation by the State on Kenyans’ right to assembly, demonstration, picketing and petition under Article 37 of 
the Constitution
; Who, between the National Police Service and the demonstrators bears the biggest responsibility for safety and peace during demonstrations and assemblies; Whether the 
National Police Service Act
 and the National Police Service Standing Order and its operational manuals as enacted are effectively checking on the perpetual vice of the excessive use of force by the Police.






23.
The role of the President of Kenya vis-à-vis the Inspector General of Police in matters of internal security cannot with all due respect be a complex issue for determination considering that 
the Constitution
 as well as the 
National Police Service Act
 has clearly delineated those responsibilities. This therefore is neither novel or a substantial question of law that should require the Chief Justice to empanel a bench to determine. The delineation of roles of the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National and the Inspector General, does not require 3 Judges to separate policy issues and operational mandate, matters that are spelt out in 
the Constitution
 and the enabling Statute. Where the buck stops in the midst of deep security crises, 
the Constitution
 has created National Security Organs and vested them with various mandates, I do not think take a whole three member bench of the High Court should be constituted to make that determination. As for who between the demonstrators and police bear greatest responsibility for safety and peace during demonstrations and assemblies; there is already a Constitutional standard on demonstrations, picketing and assemblies which I do not think will require the effort of three Judges to locate and restate. Finally, whether the 
National Police Service Act
 and the National Police Service Standing Order and its operational manuals as enacted are effectively checking on the perpetual vice of the excessive use of force by the Police. That means asking the Court to review the said standing orders to confirm if they are conformity with 
the Constitution
. It is the responsibility of whoever is alleging non-conformity with 
the Constitution
 to demonstrate the unconstitutionality so that the Court can make a determination on the issue. This Court routinely exercises this jurisdiction as a single Judge and nothing has so far been demonstrated to be so unique in regard to the said standing orders to require empanelment a three Judge bench to undertake such a task.






24.
With due respect and guided by the precedents already cited as to what constitutes a substantial question of law, it is my considered opinion that the issues raised herein are neither complex, novel or weighty. I am not persuaded that any of the issues identified would necessitate a referral of this Petition to the Chief Justice for empanelment of a bench. The Petitioner’s application under Article 165(4) of 
the Constitution
 is thus declined and dismissed.

Sentence










1.
The Accused herein was convicted of Murder following a full trial, before this court.






2.
For purposes of sentencing , a social injury was carried out by the Director of Probation and Aftercare services and this court has had a chance to look at the said report.






3.
In his mitigation through Miss Nafuye Advocate ,the Accused told the Court that he is a young officer, aged 26 years; that he has a young family who needs his care . He has further submitted that he is remorseful and that he has learnt his lessons; that he has a good standing in society and that his family is willing to rehabilitate him; he is a first offender and his job is at risk, he submits.






4.
The social inquiry established that the Accused has a good standing within the Community, and his family.






5.
Being a first offender and remorse are mitigating factors, and are positive consideration when determining the sentence. The possibility of a job loss is however not a mitigating factor.






6.
I have considered the circumstances of the offence, which in my view aggravated the accused’s crime. There was evidence that pointed to the Accused trying to conceal his crime. For instance, the deceased was found holding the nozzle of his gun when by the deceased’s own admission, the deceased’s gun was not the one that caused the fatal injury. The deceased gun also had one live bullet missing while that of the Accused’s, which had been fired as per Accused’s own testimony had all the bullets. This was an attempt to conceal evidence which is an aggravating factor pursuant to paragraph 23.1 of the Kenyan judiciary sentencing policy guidelines.






7.
Taking all the aforesaid into consideration. I hereby sentence the Accused to 20 years in prison. The sentence will take effect from the date of conviction.

The Plaintiff’s case.


5.
The plaintiff argued that it was the legal and bonafide owner of the suit property known as L.R No. 6845/106 situated in Embakasi area of Nairobi County measuring 7.4 acres having purchased it from the 10
th
 defendant who was selling the same as the agent or on behalf of the Thome Wambo women group vide an agreement of sale dated 8
th
 July 2003.






6.
It was also argued that the suit property was carved out of an 8.4-acre parcel of land that was subdivided into two portions of 7.4 acres and one (1) acre. The plaintiff bought the 7.4 acres parcel leaving the 1-acre parcel which was to be transferred to the 10
th
 defendant or its nominee. It was also argued that the plaintiff has since obtained the title to the suit property and that it holds 1 acre of the said parcel of land in trust for the 10
th
 defendant or to the 10
th
 defendant’s nominee. It was further argued that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants have on several occasions beginning September 2014 jointly and severally trespassed, encroached upon and illegally entered upon the suit property and purported to build on it while having no color of right to do so.






7.
At the trial, Patrick Newton Gukura Muraya testified on behalf of the plaintiff and was the sole plaintiff’s witness. He adopted his witness statement dated 15
th
 December 2020, the plaintiff’s list of documents dated 15
th
 December 2020 and the plaintiff’s trial bundle on record. Pursuant to leave granted by the court, the plaintiff also produced the Nairobi City County approved subdivision plan of the suit property approved on 24
th
 March 2022 in his evidence in chief.






8.
When cross examined by counsel for the 10
th
 Defendant, he stated that the property was previously owned by Thome Wambo Women group and the plaintiff bought the land when it was vacant without any encumbrances. He also stated that the 10
th
 defendant never breached the sale agreement.






9.
On cross examination by counsel for the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendant, he stated that the plaintiff had no claim against the 10
th
 defendant. He stated that he could not tell how much the 1
st
 defendant paid for the said purchase. He did not have the transfer in court. The agreement between the 1
st
 and 10
th
 defendant was never disclosed to him. It was also never disclosed that they were to get 1.8 acres. He also stated that the said agreement was null and void as it was never completed and that the plaintiff is the owner of the 7.4 acres.






10.
When asked about the plaintiff’s title to the property, he stated that the same was issued on 19
th
 May 2017 and was issued while the matter was still pending in court. He also stated that he was aware of the 1
st
 defendant’s claim of 1 acre and not 1.8 acres.






11.
When reexamined, he stated that there was nothing preventing the plaintiff from pursuing the title. He also stated that he was not part of the agreement involving the 1
st
 defendant. The 1
st
 defendant never wrote to him demanding the portion of their land. The remaining 1 acre has to be transferred to the 10
th
 defendant or its nominee and that he is not claiming anything against the 10
th
 defendant. He also stated that the 1
st
 defendant does not feature anywhere in the agreement.

st
 April 2022, the witness statement of Kibanyu Kimani dated 21
st
 November 2014, the trial bundle dated 26
th

st
 defendant took possession of the whole of the said portion of land and subdivided the same into numerous sub plots which were in turn sold to the 1
st
 defendant’s shareholders among them being the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 defendants.






15.
It was pleaded that the plaintiff was made aware of the 1
st
 defendant’s ownership of the 1.8acre portion of land by a letter dated 6
th
 August 2004 and that it has therefore been a matter within the plaintiff’s knowledge since then over a period 18 years during which time the plaintiff has had knowledge and acquiesced to the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants ownership of the 1.8 acre share portion out of the suit property.






16.
The existence of the agreement between the plaintiff and the 10
th

18.
During trial, Kimani Kibanyu a director of the 1
st
 defendant testified on its behalf, he relied on his statement dated 26
th
 November 2014 together with the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants trial bundle in his evidence in chief.






19.
It was his testimony that the 1
st
 defendant had paid a total of Kshs 600,000 to the 10
th
 defendant towards purchase of the said land. The 1
st
 defendant later got 1.8 acres and subdivided it into 15 plots to its members who took possession and developed the same. They had stayed in the land for over 13 years as at the time of filing the instant suit by the plaintiff and the plaintiff knew that they were in the said land. The said portion was not available for sale after they had taken possession.






20.
When cross examined, he stated that they had an agreement with the defendant. They did not pay the entire sum but paid only Kshs 600,000. The said agreement had not stated the price of 1 acre, they were to buy the entire parcel but only paid Kshs 600,000 which was acknowledged by the 10
th
 defendant. The same was paid through a banker’s cheque and that the amount paid was equivalent to 1.8 acres.






21.
He also stated on further cross examination that the agreement permitted the 1
st
 Defendant to be given land equivalent to the purchase price that they had paid. The 1
st
 Defendant did not do another agreement stating that they will only buy 1.8 acres. They engaged their own surveyor who told them of what acerage they were to get according to the amount of money they had paid and they were told that the same was 1.8 acres even though the 10
th
 Defendant never indicated anywhere that the land was 1.8 acres. He further stated in cross examination that they were not supposed to put up any structures on that land which was stipulated under special condition No. 4. He also stated that they were not given the title and that he was not sure if the plaintiff had the same. He also stated that his members had put up permanent houses in the property.






22.
On cross examination by counsel for the 10
th
 Defendant he stated that the land initially belonged to Thome Wambo Women’s Group, and the 10
th
 Defendant was selling the land on behalf of Thome Wambo Women’s Group. The agreement had a completion period of 120 days and it was to expire around 21
st
 April 2002. He conceded that he had no evidence to confirm that the banker’s cheque was received by the 10
th
 Defendant. He also stated that there was a letter dated 12
th
 September 2002 which stated that no further payment will be accepted. He also stated that there was no other letter confirming that they had received Kshs 600,000. He did not have his bank statement in court and that the photos do not show where the land is located.






23.
When re-examined, he stated that there was an agreement for the purchase of the land in respect to payment that had been made. The 1
st
 Defendant paid a deposit of Kshs 300,000 and later paid another installment of Kshs 300,000. The banker’s cheque was from the National Bank of Kenya. The said cheques were not returned to them and that the 10
th
 Defendant has not controverted the computation on the size of the land that the 1
st
 Defendant was to get. The photos were for the suit property and its members had constructed on the same.

st
 to 9
th
 Defendants dated 20
th
 March 2023.






25.
Joseph Kimani Mbugua the managing director and CEO of the 10
th
 Defendant testified on behalf of the 10
th
 Defendant during trial. He adopted and relied on his witness statement dated 16
th
 April 2021 in his evidence in chief.






26.
It was his testimony that the land belonged to Thome Wambo Women’s Group and the 10
th
 Defendant sold the land as its agent upon which Kshs 300,000 was paid in respect to the said agreement and they did not receive any further payments. He also stated that the first defendant breached the sale agreement and the agreement was revoked. He also stated that the sum of Kshs 300,000 entitled them to only 0.8 acres and later the land was advertised for sale and the plaintiff showed interest upon which negotiations were done and the transaction undertaken.






27.
When cross examined by counsel for the plaintiff, he stated that 7.4 acres were sold to the plaintiff for Kshs 2,664,000, the plaintiff paid the entire sum in full. He also stated that the entire parcel was 8.4 acres, 7.4 acres was transferred to the plaintiff, further the plaintiff has been willing to transfer 1 acre to the 10
th
 Defendant and its nominees. He also stated that 0.8 acres belongs to the 1
st
 Defendant, upon which Kshs 300,000 was paid by the 1
st
 Defendant. He also stated that there was no evidence that the remaining balance was ever paid.






28.
When cross examined by counsel for the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendant, he stated that the cost of the land was Kshs 335,000 per acre. The 1
st
 Defendant only paid Kshs 300,000. He also conceded that the letter dated 16
th
 September 2002, showed that a total of Kshs 600,000 had been paid. He also stated that their advocates never replied to that letter neither did they receive the same and it had no acknowledgement stamp to confirm that it was received.






29.
On further cross examination, he stated that the default was on the part of the 1
st
 Defendant, the sale agreement had timelines for 120 days. The same agreement also stated that no structures were allowed on the suit property until completion of payment. He also stated that the said agreement had not made time to be of essence and he was not aware if any completion notice was ever issued and served.






30.
When reexamined, he stated that there was a condition on the agreement that the property was not to be sold to any other person within 120 days. He was not served with any additional cheques. He has never received any summons from the police. There is no correspondence confirming that D. G Kimani advocates acknowledged payment of Kshs 600,000 since only Kshs 300,000 was received. He also denied ever being charged in any court of law for receiving any money and not delivering.








The Plaintiff’s submissions


31.
The plaintiff filed its written submissions dated 5
th
 April 2024. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted on the following issues;
a.
What is the size of the suit land the plaintiff is entitled to vis a vis the size the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants and 10
th
 defendant are entitled to, in view of the two (2) sale agreements, one between the 1
st
 Defendant and the 10
th
 Defendant and the other between the plaintiff and the 10
th
 Defendant.

d.
Who bears the costs of the suit.






32.
It was submitted that PW1 Patrick Newton Gukura Muraya and the 10
th
 Defendants witness Joseph Kimani Mbugua were both in agreement during their testimony that the plaintiff purchased 7.4 acres of the suit property and was entitled to the same. It was also submitted that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants breached the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001 as the 1
st
 Defendant only paid a sum of Kshs 300,000 against the full purchase price of Kshs 2,814,000. Only Kshs 300,000 had been paid by the 1
st
 defendant which was commensurate to 0.8 acre, and accordingly the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants are only entitled to 0.8 acre of the suit property.






33.
It was further submitted that the plaintiff had proved illegal trespass/encroachment of its portion of land of the suit property by the 1
st
 and 8
th
 Defendants and accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to the sum of Kshs 5,000,000 as general damages for illegal trespass/encroachment. The case of Mombasa ELC Case no.59 of 2015 Mohamed Raiz Shoukat and Another -vs- Yasin Abubakar Argwings Kodhek and 3 Others was cited in support of the Plaintiff’s case and the court was also urged to grant costs of the suit








Submissions of the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants


34.
The 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants filled written submissions dated 26
th
 April 2024 in support of their case. It was submitted that the contradicting positions taken by the plaintiff and the 10
th
 Defendant in the matter are both without any basis and no evidence has been led to challenge the 1
st
 Defendant and further there is no evidence to challenge the computation showing that the commensurate acerage for Kshs 600,000 was 1.8 acres that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants claim and are rightly entitled to on the basis of the evidence adduced before this court.






35.
It was also submitted that there was no evidence that the 10
th
 Defendant took out and served any completion notice upon the 1
st
 Defendant and further that the sale agreement of 21
st
 December 2001 did not make time of essence.






36.
Citing the case of Gami Properties Limited -vs- NSSF & 2 others (2018) eKLR, it was submitted that a completion notice ought to have been served if indeed time was to be considered to be of essence.






37.
It was further submitted that by the time the plaintiff and the 10
th
 Defendant were entering into the sale agreement of 8
th
 July 2003, the said transaction was at all times subject to the 1
st
 Defendant’s beneficial interest of 1.8 acres from the mother title and that the 10
th
 Defendant did not retain any interest in the 1.8 acres of land that it could purport to transfer to the plaintiff. The said agreement was made 2 years after the agreement of 21
st
 December 2001.






38.
Counsel submitted that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants had demonstrated in evidence that as far back as 4
th
 August 2004 the plaintiff’s Advocates had issued a demand letter in which they acknowledged that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants were on the suit property where they had put up beacons and dug trenches for construction. The said letter was responded to on 6
th
 August 2004 and the 1
st
 Defendant made it very clear that they had purchased 1.8 acres out of L.R No. 6845/106 and they were equally in possession of the said portion.






39.
Counsel further submitted that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants had pleaded in their amended statement of Defence dated 21
st
 April 2022 that the plaintiff’s suit as against the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants is time barred by the 
limitation of actions act
. The action of trespass ought not to have been brought after the end of three years under section 4(2) of the Limitations of Actions Act. The plaintiff became aware of the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants presence on the 1.8 acres of land and hence the latest time the suit ought to have been filed should have been the year 2010.






40.
In respect to the counter claim, it was submitted that the 1
st
 Defendant had adduced evidence through its witness Kibanyu Kimani DW1 to the effect that it took possession of the 1.8 acres of land upon execution of the sale agreement of 21
st
 December 2001, pursuant to special condition No.4 of the said agreement. It was also submitted that after it had received Kshs 600,000 the plaintiff subdivided the portion into several parcels and sold to 2
nd
 to 8
th
 Defendants who have put up their residential homes.






41.
It was further submitted that a total of 13 years had lapsed by the time this suit was filed in 2014. There was no evidence by the plaintiff that any of them took any steps to remove the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants from the suit property. The occupation of the 1.8 acres of the suit property by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants has been continuous, open and uninterrupted since 2001 and that the plaintiff even acknowledged their occupation of the land when it issued a demand letter of 4
th
 August 2004. The cases of Ndathi -vs- Itumo & 20 Others (2002) eKLR and C.A No.52 of 2012 Patrick Magu Kimunyu -vs- Joreth Limited (2015) eKLR were cited in support of the counter claim.








The Submissions of the 10
th
 Defendant


42.
The 10
th
 Defendant filled written submissions dated 10
th
 May 2024. Counsel submitted on the following issues;
a.
Whether the 10
th
 Defendant was an agent in the sale transaction over the suit property.
b.
Whether the 1
st
 Defendant defaulted in paying the full purchase price within the stipulated period.
c.
Whether the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 Defendants are privy to the sale agreement dated December 2001.






43.
Counsel submitted that all parties to the suit agreed that the suit property was originally registered to Thome Wambo Women’s Group. The 10
th
 Defendants witness in his statement and evidence before court had stated that the 10
th
 Defendant was selling the suit property as an agent of the Thome Wambo Women Group and that the said evidence was not controverted.






44.
It was also submitted that the plaintiffs witness while being cross examined by counsel for the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants testified that at the time when he purchased 7.4 acres of the suit property the entire suit property was registered in the names of Thome Wambo Women Group and that the 10
th
 Defendant had power of attorney to sell the same on behalf of the 9
th
 Defendant.






45.
It was also submitted that the 1
st
 Defendant’s witness while being cross examined by counsel for the 10
th
 defendant equally testified that the suit property initially belonged to the women group and that the 10
th
 defendant was selling it on behalf of the 9
th
 Defendant.






46.
It was further submitted that the 10
th
 Defendant being an agent of the group as acknowledged by the plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendant, no cause of action can be sustained against the 10
th
 Defendant under any of the two sale agreements executed in the sale transaction. The case of City Council of Nairobi -vs- Wilfred Kamau Githua /Githua advocates and Another (2016) eKLR was cited in support.






47.
As to whether the 1
st
 Defendant defaulted in paying the full purchase price, it was argued that the initial sale agreement was executed on 21
st
 December 2001 between the 10
th
 Defendant and the 1
st
 Defendant. The purchase price for the entire property was Kshs 2,814,000. A deposit of Kshs 300,000 was paid and the remaining balance was never completed within the stipulated time frame which was 120 days. It was submitted that condition No.4 of the said agreement allowed the 1
st
 Defendant to take possession of the suit property at the execution of the agreement but restricted putting up of any structures until completion of the transaction. Citing the case of 
Dhanjal Investments Limited -vs- Shabaha Investements Limited (Court if Appeal No. 80 of 2019
) (2022) KECA 366 (KLR)(18
th
 February 2022) (Judgement) it was submitted that the submissions by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants that a completion notice ought to have been issued are misconceived and misplaced in light of the express terms of the sale agreement and the settled law where time has been made to be of essence.






48.
Counsel further submitted that the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December, 2001 was between the 1
st
 Defendant and the 10
th
 Defendant. The 1
st
 Defendant is a separate entity from its members and none of its members can individually claim any right from a contract entered into by the 1
st
 Defendant as they can only claim through the 1
st
 Defendant. None of the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 Defendants attended court to prove their identity and interest in the suit property.






49.
It was the 10
th
 Defendant’s submission that the 1
st
 defendants witness did not produce any authority or consent which allowed him to prosecute the counterclaim on behalf of the 2
nd
 and 8
th
 defendants. Therefore, the 1
st
 defendants witness only represented the 1
st
 defendant and hence therefore the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 defendants did not attend court to lead evidence to substantiate any claim against the plaintiff and or the 10
th
 Defendant.
The 1
st
 defendants witness testified that he does not own or claim a plot on the suit property for himself and neither has he constructed on it. It was his testimony that after the execution of the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December, 2001, they gave the suit property to their members who constructed houses. None of the members being the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 defendants attended court to substantiate the said allegations that they had constructed any houses on the suit property. The 1
st
 defendants witness did not lead any substantive evidence such as share certificates to indicate who the members of the 1
st
 Defendant were and their respective alleged interest on the suit property. The photos of houses that the 1
st
 defendants witness produced before court have nothing in them to suggest that they are located on any portion of the suit property; they could be random photos obtained elsewhere.






50.
It was further submitted that to the extent that the 1
st
 Defendant’s witness admitted to not owning any house on the suit property he has no locus to argue on who may or may not have constructed on the suit property. Counsel also submitted that even if the 1
st
 defendants’ members could have constructed houses on the suit property, which is denied, the alleged constructions would have been in breach of special condition 4 of the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001.






51.
Relying on the case of Bharminder Sing Osahan -vs- Helicopters International Limited (2021)eKLR it was argued that the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 Defendants cannot in their individual capacities claim any right under the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001. The court was urged to dismiss the claim against the 10
th
 Defendant and the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants counter claim.








Analysis and Determination


52.
The court has carefully considered the pleadings, the testimonies and submissions herein and is of the view that the issues that arise for determination are as follows;
I.
Whether the plaintiff has proved its claim against the defendants to the required standard.
II.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs sought.
III.
Whether the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants counterclaim is merited and warrants the grant of the reliefs sought.
IV.
What orders should issue as to costs.






53.
It was the plaintiff’s case that through a sale agreement dated 8
th
 July 2003 it acquired 7.4 acres from the 10
th
 Defendant to be excised from the suit property. The 10
th
 Defendant witness confirmed that indeed the plaintiff purchased 7.4 Acres and paid the full price of Kshs 2,664,000. The plaintiff took possession of the said 7.4 Acres in the year 2003 after the execution of the agreement with the 10
th
 Defendant on 8
th
 July, 2003. The plaintiff later sub divided the property to smaller units and sold those smaller units/sub-plots to other 3
rd
 parties. The plaintiff confirmed that in the approved sub-division plan it has reserved plot No.5 for the 10
th
 Defendant or its nominee.






54.
The total acreage of the suit property was 8.4 Acres. That prior to the plaintiff buying the said 7.4 Acres of the suit property the 10
th
 Defendant had sold about 1 Acre of land to 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants who were in occupation of the said one (1) Acre.






55.
It was also the Plaintiff’s case that it had the title of the entire property in its name and that it is ready and willing to hive off one (1) acre of the suit property occupied by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants and transfer the same to the 10
th
 Defendant or to the 10
th
 Defendant’s Nominee but at the cost of the said 10
th
 Defendant or the said 10
th
 Defendants Nominee.






56.
During trial, the plaintiff’s witness produced PExh 4, which was an affidavit sworn by Mr. Kimani J Mbugua the director of the 10
th
 Defendant sworn on 20
th
 March 2015.






57.
The 1
st
 Defendant and the others maintained that it had entered into a sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2002 with the 10
th
 Defendant to purchase the suit property for a sum of Kshs 2,814,000 but only paid Kshs 600,000 and they were entitled to 1.8 Acres which they had taken possession of and had its members develop on the same.






58.
It is trite that he who alleges must prove. This principle is succinctly captured in Sections 107, 109 and 112 of the 
Evidence Act
. Section 107 provides as follows:
“
(1)
Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.
(2)
When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.”






59.
Sections 109 and 112 of the same Act states as follows;
“


109.
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.




“112.
In civil proceedings, when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any party to those proceedings, the burden of proving or disproving that fact is upon him.”






59.
From the evidence that was tendered herein, it is not in dispute that the plaintiff and the 1
st
 defendant entered into a sale agreement with the 10
th
 Defendant seeking to purchase the suit property separately. The 1
st
 defendant’s agreement with the 10
th
 defendant was dated 21
st
 December 2001 while the plaintiff’s agreement with the 10
th
 defendant was dated 8
th
 July 2003.






60.
The evidence on record shows that the plaintiff entered into a sale agreement with the 10
th
 Defendant for purchase of 7.4 Acres and paid the full purchase price of Kshs 2,664,000, however this agreement came after the 1
st
 Defendant had already entered into an earlier agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001 and had paid a sum of Kshs 300,000 and even taken possession of 1.8 acres of the said property.






61.
While the 1
st
 Defendant had alleged that it had paid a sum of Kshs 600,000 it however emerged during trial that only a sum of Kshs 300,000 was paid towards the purchase of the said property. The 1
st
 Defendant was unable to prove how a sum of Kshs 600,000 was paid to the 10
th
 Defendant.






62.
The evidence adduced before court also demonstrated that by the time the plaintiff and the 10
th
 Defendant were entering into the sale agreement of 8
th
 July, 2003, the said transaction was subject to the 1
st
 Defendant’s existing beneficial interest of 1.8 acres from the mother title upon which the 1
st
 Defendant had taken possession and developed the same. It therefore follows that at the time the transaction between the 10th Defendant and the plaintiff was executed, the same ought not to have included the 1.8 acres being occupied by the 1
st
 Defendant as at that time.






63.
In respect to the prayers sought by the plaintiff, it is the finding of this court that the Plaintiff can only be entitled to the portion of the suit property excluded the 1.8 acres of the entire parcel 8.4 acres being claimed by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants. This in essence will only include 6.6 acres of the said property.






64.
In respect to the prayers for damages for illegal trespass as pleaded and submitted by the Plaintiff, the evidence tendered herein shows that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants occupied the 1.8 acres of the suit property after the execution of the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001 and as such the prayer for damages for illegal trespass is not for granting.






65.
In respect to the 1
st
 to 8
th
 defendants counterclaim, it is worth noting that a counterclaim just like any other suit ought to be proved to the required standard.






66.
It was the case of the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants case in the counterclaim that they bought the suit property from the 10
th
 Defendant who was selling it on behalf of the Thome Wambo Women’s Group and that they took possession of 1.8 acres of land upon execution of the sale agreement dated 21
st
 December 2001.






67.
The evidence adduced herein clearly confirmed that the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants took possession and had developed the said portion of 1.8 Acres. It was also evident that they had been in occupation for a period of over 12 years as at the time of filing suit.






68.
Moving to the claim for adverse possession, the law on the same is provided for under Section 7 of the 
Limitation of Actions Act
 as follows;
“
An action may not be brought by any person to recover land after the end of twelve years from the date on which the right of action accrued to him or, if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims, to that person.”






69.
Further provisions are made under Sections 13, 17 and 38 of the 
Limitation of Actions Act
 whose net effect is to extinguish the title of the proprietor of the land in favour of a party who has been in possession thereof for a minimum period of 12 years.






70.
Discussing the essential elements in a claim for adverse possession, the Court of Appeal in the case of Richard Wefwafwa Songoi vs Ben Munyifwa Songoi [2020] eKLR stated thus:
“
A person who claims adverse possession must inter alia show:
(a)
on what date he came into possession;
(b)
what was the nature of his possession;
(c)
whether the fact of his possession was known to the other party;
(d)
for how long his possession has continued; and
(e)
that the possession was open and undisturbed for the requisite 12 years.”






71.
Equally in the case of Mtana Lewa –v- Kahindi Ngala Mwangandi- COA MALINDI (2015) eKLR it was held that:
“
Adverse Possession is essentially a situation where a person takes Possession of land, asserts rights over it and the person having title to it omits or neglects to take action against such person in assertion of his title for a certain period, in Kenya 12 years.”
Also see Paul Mwangi Gachuru vs. Kamande Nguku (2017) eKLR.






72.
The analysis of the evidence adduced herein shows that there was a sale agreement between the 1
st
 Defendant and the 10
th
 Defendant executed on 21
st
 December 2001 upon which only a sum of Kshs 300,000 was paid towards the acquisition of the suit property leaving some substantial balance. The 1
st
 Defendant as per the said agreement took possession of 1.8 acres of the suit property upon its execution on 21
st
 December 2001. It therefore appears that the initial entry into the suit land was as per the said agreement hence there was consent from the seller. However, the agreement was not finalized as the 1st Defendant never completed by paying the remaining balance just like the case of Paul Mwangi Gachuru (Supra). The evidence on record shows that the entry was permissive in the beginning and later the agreement was never completed but the 1
st
 Defendant took possession and remained in the 1.8 acres of the suit property.






73.
It was also evident that the 1
st
 Defendant after taking possession of the 1.8 Acres subdivided and sold to the 2
nd
 to 8
th
 Defendants who developed the said portion. This evidence was not challenged in any way. In light of the foregoing the court finds the counter claim by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants is merited.






74.
Having considered the totality and weight of the evidence tendered here it is the finding of this court that the plaintiff’s claim partially succeeds only to the extent of being entitled to the portion of the suit property excluding the 1.8 acres occupied by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants while the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants counterclaim is merited and they ae entitled to the reliefs sought herein.






75.
In respect to the costs of the suit and counterclaim, this court having considered the circumstances of this case and also the fact that the plaintiff’s claim has partially succeeded directs each party to bear own costs of the suit and counterclaim.








Final Orders


76.
In the end, this court issues the following final orders; -
a.
A declaration is hereby issued that only 6.6 acres of the suit property belongs to the plaintiff.
b.
The 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants counterclaim is hereby allowed as follows; -
i.

st
 to 8
th
 Defendants have acquired title by way of adverse possession to the 1.8 acres portion of land occupied by themselves out of L.R No. 6845/106 – Embakasi Nairobi and they be registered and issued with certificate of title in respect of the said portion of 1.8 acres.
ii.
The registration of the Plaintiff, Inshwil Builders Engineering Company Limited as proprietor of the 1.8 acres occupied by the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants out of L.R No. 6845/106 – Embakasi Nairobi be cancelled and the Chief Registrar of Titles to register the 1
st
 to 8
th
 Defendants as the registered properties of the 1.8 acre portion of land out of the suit property.
iii.
A permanent Injunction is hereby issued restraining the Plaintiff and 10

IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF TUBULA LISAKA AHINDHUKA






In the matter of




Angeline Nyanga


 


Applicant










Judgment










1.
The proceedings herein relate to the Estate of Tibula Lisaka Ahindukha (Deceased). On 22/11/2010, a Grant of settlers of Administration intestate were issued to one Indretta Lunani Lisaka in respect of THE deceased’s Esate. That Grant was confirmed on 12/06/2012 and a certificate of confirmation of Grant issued on 14/06/2012.






2.
On 13/08/2019, Angeline Nyanga ,the Applicant herein, filed for the revocation of Grant, and by an order, made on 14/09/19 the court revoked the Grant. Subsequently through a mediated settlement the Applicant and one Alex Tubula were appointed as Administrators of the Estate on 06/08/2021.






3.
Through the summons dated 12/01/2022, the Applicant applied for confirmation of Grant. This is the summons due for determination.






4.
In the affidavit in support she has listed land parcel no. Idako/Shiseso/233 measuring about 6.4 hectares as the only property of the Estate (The suit property) and she listed herself, Joseph Ikhelahi and Parcel Ngala as the dependants of the deceased.






5.
In a ruling delivered on 29/07/2022, Justice Musyoka declined to confirm the Grant and directed the Administrators to make full disclosure of the dependants of the Deceased.






6.
In compliance with the said directions ,the Applicant swore an Affidavit and a further Affidavit sworn on 26/10/2023 in which she listed the Deceased’s dependants as follows:
1
st
 wife – Rose Isoyi    Children:
1.
Augustine Mzeo Tubula
2.
Jerementina Muhanda
3.
Anne Muremevo
4.
Alphonce Shisira
2
nd
 wife – Henrietta Lunani       Children:
1.
Rita Khasoa Tubula (Deceased)
2.
Elizabeth Tubula (Deceased)
3.
Joseph Ikhalachi (Deceased)
4.
Rose Tubula
5.
Dariya Muyuko (Deceased)
6.
Njomo Tubula (Deceased)
7.
Linet Tubula
8.
Petronila Mutsaca
9.
Emma Khahoya
10.
Pascal Ngala
3rd wife: Anna Muremelo        Children:
1.
Angeline Nyanga (Applicant)






7.
She further stated that the 1
st
 wife has another parcel of land to which she and her children relocated to, during the life time of the deceased. She is however in occupation of the suit property together with the children of the 2
nd
 wife. The 3
rd
 wife , her mother separated with the deceased .






8.
On perusal of the affidavits filed , I directed the applicant to take the witness stand for purposes of clarifying averments she had made on the said Affidavits






The oral Evidence


9.
She told the court that the first wife Rose Isoyi and Henrieta Lunani have since died; her own mother has also died .That Augustine Mzeo Tubula died without leaving any children or wife; That Jereminta has her own land in Khayega; Alphonce Shirisha from the 1
st
 wife do not live in the suit property as they have their own land.






10.
She further testified that Rita Khasoa has since died, she never left any children ; That Elizabeth Tubula has also died but left behind children who currently reside in kakamega ; Joseph ikalachi died but left no children or wife. She further told the court that Darinya Muyuke died and left no children; Njomo Tubula also died without leaving any children while Linet Tubula has her own residence in Shinyalu. She further stated that Patronila Mutsaca lives on her marital home while the whereabouts of Emma Khaoya remain unknown. She further told the court that Pascal Ngala’s whereabouts is also unknown but his children , one of whom is her Co – Administrator Alex Tubula, reside in the suit property.






11.
Despite notices being issued, the rest of the dependants failed to appear in court. The co- Administrator was further issued with summons to appear but failed to do so . consequently, the hearing proceeded without their participation.








Determination


12.
I have considered the application, the supporting and further affidavits as well as the Applicant’s oral testimony in court.






13.
From the evidence, the wives of the deceased have all died. The appropriate mode of distribution therefore is the one set out under section 38 of the 
Law of succession Act
. The section provides as follows:  “ Where an intestate has left a surviving child or children but no spouse, the net intestate estate shall, subject to the provisions of sections 41 and 42, devolve upon the surviving child, if there be only one, or be equally divided among the surviving children.






14.
It further came out from the testimony of the applicant that Augustine Mzeo Tubula, Rita Kasoa, Darinya Muyuku and Njomo Tubula died without leaving behind children or spouses. It was further her testimony that the children from the 1
st
 wife have their own land in which they had settled prior the deceased’s demise. I take the applicant’s Testimony as uncontested as the rest of the beneficiaries failed to turn up to contest the facts presented.






15.
Thus in regard to the children of the first wife, I accept the applicant’s testimony that they have since settled on another land parcel to which they moved to, prior to the deceased’s death. Consequently, I will exclude the children from the 1
st
 wife from the distribution of the suit property.






16.
It was further the applicant’s testimony that the children of the 2
nd
 wife as well as herself from the 3
rd
 wife , reside in the suite property.






17.
I have noted that even though the applicant has listed the children of the deceased, she has not made provisions for all them . From her oral testimony in court , it is apparent that , she has assumed that her married half – sisters should not inherit from the deceased. However, section 38 of the 
Law of succession Act
 envisages equal distribution regardless of the marriage or economic status of the deceased’s heirs. In this regard I find support in the case Eliseus Mbura M’thara v Harriet Ciambaka & Another [2012] eKLR where the court held: The 
law of Succession Act
 does not discriminate between gender in matters of succession or inheritance. Under the 
law of Succession Act
 and indeed under 
the Constitution
 a child is a child and every person has equal rights under the law irrespective of gender. The 
Law of succession Act
 does not discriminate between married or unmarried daughters but gives them equal rights to inheritance as the other children (sons) of a deceased person.






18.
The applicant has also proposed to hold some of the properties in trust but there is no reason advanced as to why trusteeship is necessary. By the Applicant’s own admission, the said children are Adults . Therefore the plea by the Applicant to hold the property in trust has no basis.






19.
In view of what I have stated in paragraph 
14
 hereof ,I have identified the following heirs to be either surviving, or died but left children behind and are therefore entitled to a share of Land parcel No. I dako/Shiseso/233 :
1.
The Estate of Elizabeth Tubula
2.
The Estate of Joseph Ikalachi
3.
Rose Tubula
4.
Linet Tubula
5.
Petronila Mutsaca
6.
Emma Khaoya
7.
Pascal Ngala
8.
Angeline Nyanga






20.
A search done of the suit property on 7/8/08 shows that the property is approximately 6.4 ha (equivalent to 14.4 acres). This property will be shared equally between the deceased’s children in accordance with section 38 of the 
Law of Succession Act
.






21.
In conclusion, I hereby proceed to make the following orders:
a).
The suit property will be shared equally between the following dependants:
1.
The Estate of Elizabeth Tubula
2.
The Estate of Joseph Ikhalachi
3.
Rose Tubula

Linet Tubula

Rebecca Wambui Rukeyser has been catering for the upkeep and medical expenses of Ruth Waruguru Warui and also been catering for expenses incurred by the Estate of the deceased despite the Estate having a monthly income.






37.
That on the 10
th
 August 2021, a family meeting was held regarding the deceased's property known as Lake-View, where it provided for three administrators of the property and all the family members were to sign the said document; however most of the beneficiaries did not sign the said document making it null and void.






38.
That, the deceased properties especially the motor-vehicles registration No. KAR 502C Suzuki Escudo, KAR 233E Toyota Hiace, KBK 228W Nissan Xtrail, has been in possession of some of the beneficiaries who has been intermeddling with the said properties without the express authority from this Honourable Court.






39.
That, some beneficiaries have intermeddled with the property known as Lake-View which is a commercial property hindering the estate to earn any income.






40.
Following the intermeddling of the said estate has led to a risk of the estate to be disconnected of the electricity since the said beneficiaries has not been paying the utility bill and therefore risking the estate to be sued.






41.
Rebecca Wambui Rukeyser has in many occasions written to the bank to complain of the withdrawals done by the signatories on the said bank account with no success.






42.
That the signatories are in contempt of the consent which was adopted as the order of this Court and should account for the funds withdrawn from the said bank before this Court.






43.
That, Susan Nyambura, Ayub Warui, Eric Warui and Daniel Warui be ordered to refund all and any of the proceeds they have withdrawn from the said bank account and/or misappropriated from the entire estate.






44.
That Ayub Warui has been intermeddling with the deceased's property and selling the equipment and livestock, leasing the property and spending the proceeds namely; highland's farm.






Analysis & Determination


45.
This Court is of the considered view that the succession of the deceased shall settle an apparent split between the two houses in the estate of the deceased.






46.
This Court notes with disdain the manner in which the citation was introduced against Ruth Waruguru when it was apparent to Susan Nyambura, that she lacked capacity and that the family had in fact nominated Rebecca Wambui Rukeyser to jointly take out the letters of Administration.






47.
The Citation thus marks a classical weaponization of litigation long before personal representatives were appointed.






48.
This Court believes that where a deceased person left no will and an intestate process automatically flows, it is critical and imperative that personal representatives be appointed as soon as the matter is placed before Court. This then can enable the Court to hold any party to account.






49.
I am unable to hold anyone liable for intermeddling or failure to abide by the consent and that this does not absolve any party that may have so far committed transgressions on the estate of the deceased.






50.
This Court has in the past held that a deceased person intestate estate is by virtue of the 
Law of Succession Act
 subject to the protection of the Court and that an estate cannot be on auto-pilot such as in this instance where the two houses of the deceased have engaged in side litigation for three years.






51.
I am however persuaded to forthwith appoint Rebecca Wambui Rukeyser and Susan Nyambura, as the Personal Representatives and Administrators of the estate late John Warui Mathenge and that a Grant of Letters of Administration intestate shall issue.






52.
The palpable split and bad blood in the two houses even where the deceased had undertaken a distribution is saddening to this Court and this Court believes its only distribution of the deceased’s estate that shall resolve the same.






53.
The Administrators are expected to distribute the estate of the deceased within six months from today without fail.






54.
With regards to the squabbles relating monies that remain unaccounted, this Court shall entertain application(s) relating to failure to account after the distribution of the assets.






55.
Failure by the Administrators to agree on a common mode of distribution any of the Administrator may file the summons for confirmation with the co-administrator filing an affidavit of protest.






56.
With regards to agitation for costs, I am of the view that the costs shall be borne of the estate of the deceased.






57.
It is so ordered

          (An appeal from the Judgment of Hon C. A. Ogweno (SRM) delivered on 9th November, 2022 in Kisii Chief Magistrate’s Court Criminal (Sexual Offences Case) No. E005 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Felix Mwangi Maiko the appellant herein was charged with the offence of Incest contrary to section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The particulars being that the appellant on 8
th
 day of April, 2021 at around 0700 hrs at [particulars withheld] location in Kitutu Central sub-county within Kisii county being a male person, caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of female person who was to his knowledge his daughter. He faced an alternative count of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. Particulars being that on the 8
th
 day of April, 2021 at 0700 same stated place he intentionally touched the vagina of E.K. a child aged 8 years with his penis.






2.
The appellant denied the charges and the case proceeded to full hearing with the prosecution calling five (5) witnesses while the appellant gave a sworn statement of defence and called no witness. He was thereafter convicted of the main count and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.






3.
Being aggrieved by the Judgment he filed the Appeal dated 18
th
 November, 2022 through the firm of Nyagaka, Mosoka & associate advocates citing the following grounds:
i.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not considering that the case against the accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt as required by the law.
ii.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in improperly analyzing the evidence of the complainant and her witnesses.
iii.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not realizing that a case of incest was not proved in support of the charge.
iv.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not finding that the evidence adduced was not collaborative but was inconsistent with the charge.
v.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by admitting and relying on defective evidence by PW5 senior clinical officer without authority from relevant office.
vi.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not establishing that the medical evidence was defective and unsafe and unsupported for it to be relied upon.
vii.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not finding that the evidence adduced in support of the charge was inconsequential and did not implicate the accused at all – being hearsay.
viii.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in not finding that the whole evidence was a constructive frame-up against the accused due to the failed relationship between the complainant’s parents.
ix.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in considering issues of law in her judgment more than the actual facts presented.
x.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in dismissing the accused’s defence that couldn’t be challenged by the prosecution.






4.
A summary of the evidence on record is that the appellant is the husband of PW2 MNM who is the mother to PW1. On the other hand, the appellant is a step-father to PW1. PW1 was born on 6
th
 June 2012 and a birth certificate was produced to that effect (EXB 1).






5.
PW2 left home for work on 8
th
 April, 2021 at 6.00am leaving behind her brother J, the appellant and PW1. Later as PW1 was playing outside she was called into the house by the appellant who then closed the door. The appellant placed seat cushions on the floor and asked her to lie on them. He then brought a blanket and covered her head and removed her trouser and panty. He then did “tabia mbaya” to her by inserting his penis inside her vagina. When through he sent her to the river after threatening her. He followed her to the river and returned home with her.






6.
PW1 mentioned this to her friend Purine who informed her own mother who then told PW2. A member of the community policing (PW3) was informed and that’s how the appellant was arrested. The minor was later taken to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital for treatment. Dr. Nyameino Daniel (PW5) from the said facility testified and confirmed having examined the minor on 12
th
 April, 2021. He found her to have been treated on 9
th
 April, 2021. She had the following


Torn hymen


Vaginal swab revealed epithelial and pus cells


No spermatozoa


All other lab tests were negative








7.
His conclusion was that there was no obvious medical evidence to support defilement. He produced the P3 form as EXB 3, and the PRC Form as EXB2. To him at age 8 years it was not possible for the hymen to be reached without causing injuries on the outside genitalia. He also stated that a female can be born with an absent hymen. In his opinion, it was unlikely that penetration occurred.






8.
In his sworn statement of defence the appellant testified that on 7
th
 April, 2021 his first wife W called him asking to be sent money. He asked her to collect it the next day. PW2 threatened to deal with him if he did. By then he had injured his leg. The next day PW2 went to work and he remained behind with his in-law JO and PW1. He could not move freely because of the injury. He stated that their house had two bedrooms and he had never entered PW1’s bedroom.






9.
PW2 returned home at 8pm when some people came and arrested him. It was claimed by PW2 that he had defiled PW1. They went to the hospital together and the doctor confirmed that PW1 had not been defiled. He testified that he was not in a position to have sex even with his own wife and that J who was in the house never recorded a statement.






10.
The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.






The appellant’s submissions


11.
These submissions are dated 18
th
 December, 2023 and were filed on 20
th
 December, 2023 by the appellant’s advocates. Counsel while relying on the case of Mohamed Boru Guyo v Republic Marsabit High Court Appeal No. E001 of 2020 submitted that the appellant had been involved in an accident and was incapable of having sexual intercourse even with PW2. That the trial court ignored the fact that the appellant was walking on crutches, and that he had been framed by the said PW2.






12.
Relying further on the case of Republic v Rasta Mugina Malindi Criminal Appeal Case No. 20 of 2020 he submitted that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Further that the trial magistrate did not take into account the defence by the appellant. Reference was made to the case of Voi High Court J.M.N v Republic HCRA No. E017 of 2021.






13.
The respondent’s submissions are dated 4
th
 December 2023 and were filed by prosecution counsel. Akelo Job Cletus: He submitted that the prosecution proved all the ingredients of incest. Age was proved and the appellant identified as the father of the minor. On the medical evidence counsel argued that the prosecution had proved there was contact between the appellant’s genitalia and that of PW1 hence incest was proved.








Analysis and Determination


14.
Upon careful consideration of the evidence on record, submissions, authorities cited and the law I find the main issue for determination to be whether the offence of incest was proved against the appellant. In determining this issue, I will have to consider a few other issues.






15.
Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines incest as follows:
Incest by male persons
1.
Any male person who commits an indent act or an act which cause penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years.
Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.
Section 22 of the same Act provides as follows:
Test of relationship
1.
In case of the offence of incest, brother and sister includes half-brother, half-sister and adoptive brother and adoptive sister and a father includes a half father and an uncle of the first degree and a mother includes a half mother and an aunt of the first degree whether through lawful wedlock or not.






16.
There is no dispute about the relationship between PW1, PW2 and the appellant. The minor PW1 is indeed a step daughter to the appellant and any sexual encounter between them would amount to incest. The charge sheet indicates PW1’s age as 8 years. A birth certificate S/No XXXX – Entry No. XXXX in PW1’s name with no father’s name was produced as EXB1. It shows the date of birth as 6
th
 June, 2012 meaning at the time of the alleged offence PW1 was aged 8 years plus 10 months. This confirms that she was below 18 years hence a minor.






17.
The next critical issue is whether there was penetration of the minor’s genital organ by a male organ as stated in the charge sheet. Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 define “penetration” as meaning the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person”.






18.
PW1 testified that besides the 8
th
 April, 2021 the appellant had had sex with her one other time. This is at Pg 19 line 4 where she states: “This was the 2
nd
 time he had done tabia mbaya to me”. On the other hand, PW2 told the court something different at Pg 20 line 26-28
“
The child also said you had defiled her previously on several occasions. I did not know. The child had not opened up to me before”
Additionally, the arresting officer stated this at Pg 25 line 8
“
The child said you had defiled her on several occasions”.
The doctor in his introduction stated at Pg 26 lines 1-3.
“
On 12/4/2021 I examined a child aged 8 years old under reference No. XXXX/21 Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. She had a history of defilement by the father on several days including 8/4/2021”.






19.
From the above excerpts it is clear that what PW2, PW4 and PW5 told the court about the times PW1 had been defiled is different from what PW1 herself told the court. PW5 must have gotten that information from the hospital treatment notes which were in any event not availed to the court. If indeed PW1 had been defiled severally as claimed by PW2 and PW4 then this court expects that to be revealed by the evidence of PW5 the doctor who filled the P3 Form.






20.
A critical examination of the evidence of PW5 reveals that the doctor did not find any obvious support of defilement of the minor. Yes, the doctor upon reading the treatment notes indicated that the hymen was torn. There is nothing showing that as at 9
th
 April, 2021 PW1’s hymen was freshly torn to confirm penetration. I pull out two sentences in evidence by the doctor (PW5) who was a prosecution witness. He stated thus: Pg 27 lines 4-5
“
I came to a conclusion that there was no obvious medical evidence to support defilement”.
Lines 13-14
“
In my opinion, it is unlikely that penetration occurred”.
PW2 in her own evidence at Pg 20 lines 2-5
“
When I went home I found F, J and E. I called E aside to the bedroom. Upon inquiries she said she had been defiled by the father at 6.30am. She did not appear in any visible pain”.






21.
This is an 8-year-old child alleged to have been defiled by an adult fit to be father and she did not appear to be in any visible pain according to the mother. It is not disputed that the appellant had been injured while at a construction site in January, 2020 and was using crutches up to the time he was appearing in court for the hearing of the case. He claimed not to be functioning sexually at the time. In view of his condition, the allegations and denial of the charge was it difficult for the trial court to order for a medical examination of him to rule out any elements of pretence?






22.
Further more in view of the medical evidence by PW5, the court ought to have examined PW1’s unsupported evidence with a keener eye. She never gave any evidence on exactly what the appellant did to her after removing her trouser and panty. What did she go to do at the river? Was the appellant walking on crutches when he allegedly went for her at the river?






23.
John the brother of PW2 was at the house when she left for work. At what point did he leave the house since PW1 says she was defiled at 6.30am after being called back to the house by the appellant. Was John in the house then? Was PW1 indeed playing outside at 6.30am? John ought to have recorded a statement and come to testify. The court was never told why that was never done.






24.
The appellant denied having committed the offence complained of. He explained his inability to engage in sex even with his wife. (PW2). The doctor’s evidence does not support the claims by PW1 and PW2. All these pieces of evidence have made this court ask the many above questions as PW1’s evidence is left in limbo. These are issues which are key and had the learned trial Magistrate addressed them the court would not have arrived at the decision it did.






25.
Since this court is not satisfied with the evidence of PW1 it will not use it to convict the appellant on the alternative count. The upshot is that the prosecution did not prove its case to the required standard.






26.
For my part I find merit in the Appeal which I hereby allow. The conviction is quashed and the sentence set aside. The appellant shall be released unless otherwise lawfully held under a separate warrant.
Orders accordingly

Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the sentence of Honourable C.A Ocharo - Senior Principal Magistrate in Kisii S.O No. E058 of 2022, delivered on 7th October, 2022)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Cyprian Onditi Sabure the appellant was charged with the offence of Defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The particulars being that the appellant on diverse dates between the 29
th
 September, 2022 and 5
th
 October, 2022 at Iyabe Location in Kisii South sub-county within Kisii county intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of T.O a child aged 15 years.






2.
He faces an alternative count of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The appellant was first arraigned in court on 7
th
 October, 2022 when the charge was read to him and he admitted it. The facts were then read out to him and he responded saying they were true. The learned trial magistrate then convicted him. After hearing the prosecution and the appellant on mitigation he sentenced him to thirty (30) years imprisonment.






3.
Being dissatisfied the appellant filed this petition of Appeal challenging both the conviction and sentence on the following grounds:
i.
That the trial magistrate erred in both law and fact when convicting him while relying on the facts adduced in Court which facts were not proved to the required standards of law given that he pleaded guilty to the alleged charges.
ii.
That the judgment of the court was a nullity as the trial proceeded without the court warning him that he had a right to a fair and impartial trial as enshrined in 
the constitution
 as per Article 50 (2) (h) i.e the right to be represented by the advocate.
iii.
That the appellant was not accorded a fair and impartial trial as guaranteed by Article 25 (c) of 
the constitution
 as the trial commenced without the court having received a report as to ‘his mental fitness’ to stand trial or prove to the court that his plea of guilty was voluntary.
iv.
That the sentence awarded is highly excessive and punitive
v.
That the sentence is illegal given that the complainant was 15 years of age equally the age of the complainant was not established since the birth certificate was not produced to ascertain her age.






4.
The appellant’s submissions were filed on 15
th
 November, 2023. A summary of his submissions is that the plea was not unequivocal. He contends that his admission of the charge was not voluntary and his right to legal representation was violated. He referred to the case of Adan v Republic [1975] E.A 445 to support his argument.






5.
Learned counsel Justus Ochenge for the ODPP filed submissions dated 3
rd
 November, 2023. It’s his submission that from what transpired in the trial court the plea was properly taken and was therefore unequivocal. He however argued that the minimum sentence being 20 years imprisonment the 30 years sentence was a bit excessive. This is after considering that the appellant pleaded guilty thus saving on the court’s time. He urged the court to consider reducing the sentence.






Analysis and determination


6.
I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the record, both submissions and the law. I find two main issues falling for determination. These are:
i.
Whether the plea was unequivocal.
ii.
Whether the sentence was appropriate.






Issue no. (I) Whether the plea was unequivocal


7.
The word unequivocal means “Leaving no doubt; clear; unambiguous; unquestionable” A plea is considered unequivocal if the charge is read to an accused person and he pleads guilty and thereafter, the facts are narrated to the accused person and he or she is once more asked to respond to the facts.






8.
To confirm whether or not a plea was unequivocal one looks at the record because an appellant seeking sympathy can say anything to woe the court. The court record of 7
th
 October, 2022 clearly shows who were present before the court. Present was the Senior Principal Magistrate, prosecution, Court Assistant and the Appellant. There was interpretation of three (3) languages namely English/Kiswahili/Kisii. After the charge was read to him in a language he understood, in response he stated:
“
Kweli”






9.
Thereafter the full facts were stated by the prosecutor, to which the appellant responded as follows:
“
Facts are true”
Upon conviction the appellant mitigated saying I did a mistake and I pray to be forgiven. I am 32 years old”






10.
On whether the appellant was warned of the seriousness of the offence and sentence the record shows:
“
Accused is warned on the seriousness of the offence and sentence but he still pleads guilty”






11.
This warning came as the appellant notified the court of his intention to admit the charge. He was therefore warned of the seriousness of the offence and even the consequences of pleading guilty. He nowhere sought for time to think through especially after the warning. He cannot therefore claim to have been ignorant of the seriousness of and consequences of the offence. There is no evidence of any unfairness exhibited against the appellant. From the seriousness of the offence the appellant was at liberty to engage an advocate. There is no provisions for pro bono lawyers for those charged with sexual offences. From the record I am satisfied that the plea herein was unequivocal and there is no reason for this court to order for a re-trial.








Issue no (ii) whether the sentence was appropriate.


12.
Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides for the sentence for an offence under section 8(1) of the Sexual Offence Act. It provides as follows:
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years”






13.
The appellant was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. From the facts of the case and which the appellant admitted he did not defile the victim once. It was several times. He even went for this girl from her home and took her to a bar where he defiled her severally. He told the court he was 32 years old then, which is twice the age of the victim.
I have considered all the facts surrounding this case. The question is whether the trial court acted on wrong principles or overlooked same material factors or took into account irrelevant factors. Further, is the issue as to whether the sentence is illegal or inordinately excessive. See (i) Shadrack Kipkoech Kogo v Republic Eldoret Criminal Appeal No, 253 of 2003. (ii) Wilson Waitegei v Republic [2021] eKLR.






14.
Learned counsel Mr. Ayodo was of the view that the sentence of thirty (30) years was excessive considering that the appellant pleaded guilty and saved on the court’s time.






15.
The victim’s conduct was also wanting. Could she have led this man into believing that she was of age even if he did not state it? The prosecutor told the court that he did not have the victims birth certificate. He did not present anything to the court to prove the victim’s age. The treatment notes plus the P3 Form shows the age as presented to the authors by the victim and others. One thing is however clear that the victim was not an adult.






16.
Considering all the above and the fact that the Appellant admitted the charge on his first appearance in court. The prosecution does not support the sentence. There is however no error on the record to warrant an order for a re-trial being made as sought by the Appellant






17.
In light of the above I confirm the conviction and allow the appeal against sentence.






18.
The sentence of thirty (30) years imprisonment imposed by the learned trial magistrate is hereby set aside and substituted with a sentence of seven (7) years imprisonment from the date of conviction.






19.
Orders accordingly

Ruling










1.
The 1
st
 Application is a Petition dated 31
st
 August 2021 filed on 16
th
 November 2021 Petition for guardianship of RWM (hereinafter referred to as ""the subject"") and management of her estate under Section 26 and 28 of the 
Mental Health Act
, Cap 248 of the Laws of Kenya.






2.
The Petitioner, DMM is the biological daughter to ""the subject"" a person suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of the 
Mental Health Act
 Cap 248 of the Laws of Kenya and therefore falls within the ambit and jurisdiction of the said Act.






3.
""The subject"" is 78 years and is currently domiciled at Bahati, Nakuru and suffers from age related neurological disorder (Alzheimer's Dementia) characterized by a progressive impairment of cognitive functions consisting of global impairment of intellect, manifested by difficulty with memory, attention, thinking and comprehension. Other affected functions include mood personality, judgment, social behavior and self - care activities.






4.
She has no ability to make sound judgment to weigh, to reason out or make reasonable decision, has no insight to the nature of her disturbance and is also incapable of handling her money and finances. The grounds of knowledge and belief in the mental disorder or incapacity to manage her affairs are founded on the medical and psychiatrist report submitted by Dr. Njau Consequently, ""the subject"" is not capable of managing and administering her property business matters, legal transactions and other dealings and affairs of a similar kind and is therefore unable to manage her own affairs as set out under the 
Mental Health Act
.






5.
The Petitioner therefore prays that this grants the following Orders:
i.
That RWM is hereby adjudged to be a person suffering from a mental disorder under Section 26 of the 
Mental Health Act

Analysis and Determination


11.
All decisions made herein are made in respect to the best interest of the subject “the subject”.






12.
The 
Mental Health Act
 CAP 248 is the law relating to the care of persons who are suffering from mental disorder or mental sub-normality with mental disorder; for the custody of their persons and the management of their estates; for the management and control of mental hospitals; and for connected purposes.






13.
A person suffering from mental disorder means a person who has been found to be so suffering under this Act and includes a person diagnosed as a psychopathic person with mental illness and person suffering from mental impairment due to alcohol of substance abuse;






14.
Section 29 provides for the Power to apply property for maintenance of person suffering from mental disorder without appointing manager:
“
(1)
Where it appears to the Court that, having regard to the circumstances of a person who is suffering from mental disorder and of his family and any other relative circumstance, it is expedient that his property should be made available for his or their maintenance it may, instead of appointing a manager or, notwithstanding such appointment, order that the property or the proceeds thereof when realized be paid to such person as the Court may think fit, to be applied for such maintenance.
(2)
Where it appears to the Court that a person is suffering from mental disorder of a temporary nature and that it is expedient to make temporary provision for his maintenance or for the maintenance of such members of his family as are dependent upon him for their maintenance, the Court may in the manner provided in subsection (1), direct that his property or sufficient part of it be applied for such purpose.
(3)
The receipt of any person under subsection (1) shall be a valid discharge to any person who pays any money delivers any property of the person suffering from mental disorder to the person so appointed.""






15.
According to the Medical Report by Dr. Njau J. W, a psychiatrist, the subject was examined on the 20
th
 August 2020 and found to suffer from age related neurological disorder (Alzeheimer Dementia) she has no ability to make sound judgment or reasonable decision. Additionally, the Applicant has availed to the medical examination report confirming the mental illness of the subject.






16.
It is apparent from the doctor’s report that the subject is suffering from a mental disorder as per Section 2 of the Mental Act and further a medical condition contemplated under Section 26 of the Act and is thus incapable of managing her own affairs.






17.
Notably, Section 26 of the Act gives Court the power to make an order regarding management of the estate of any person suffering from mental disorder to any relative or any person suitable but giving preference to a relative.






18.
The Applicant is a daughter to the subject with the responsibility of taking care of her and this is confirmed by the Applicant’s affidavit deponing that she has been taking care of the subject medical needs.






19.
In my considered view, the Applicant has availed sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the subject suffers from schizophrenia and is incapable of managing herself and her property which is already subject to unexplained internal unexplained family wrangle. It is not in dispute that the Applicant is a biological daughter of the subject and has shown commitment to take care of the subject’s property by filing legal proceedings in this Court.






20.
I am satisfied that the Applicant has established that she is qualified to be appointed a guardian of the subject and a manager to her property.






21.
I find the 1
st
 Application is merited and it is hereby allowed with modifications to suit the peculiar circumstances.






22.
With regards to the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Applications, the Court observes that the 3
rd
 Application ought to have been a response to the 2
nd
 Application but the Applicants deemed it fit to further obfuscate the issue.






23.
In a nutshell the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents argue that their father cannot be buried on the only land Bahati/Bahati Block 1/XXXX registered in the name of “the subject” who is a souse of the deceased for decades.






24.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents contend that their mother has not consented to the burial hence their opposition. The Respondents have not incorporated any arguments for utilization of the proceedings to get a guardian appointed to act on her behalf.






25.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents have not offered any alternative where the remains of the deceased may be interned other than casually indicating that their deceased father can be buried in a public cemetery.






26.
This Court pondered, if the subject had a lucid moment to comprehend the happenings and she was asked where she would wish to have the remains of her husband buried, what would be her answer?






27.
This Court is of the view that “the subject” would wish her husband of many years is buried on her only land, no evidence to the contrary has been tendered by the Respondents.






28.
The reliefs being sought herein relating to injunctions against burial remain hollow relief in the absence of protective orders for the subject and as such the Court in its wisdom has resolved to have two joint guardians Appointed herein in the interim.






29.
The Reliefs sought in the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Applications are discretionary in nature, thereby inviting the Court to rule on what ideally should be “the subject’s” best interest






30.
RWM is hereby adjudged to be a person suffering from a mental disorder under Section 26 of the 
Mental Health Act
 Cap 248 of the Laws of Kenya thereby entitled to legal protection.






31.
The 1
st
 Applicant - DMM, is hereby appointed Joint-guardian of the Subject,






32.
The 1
st
 Respondent-AWC is hereby is hereby appointed Joint-guardian.






33.
The Joint guardians shall be expected to work together and if for any reason this is not possible, then parties can approach this Court for appropriate directions.






34.
An Order is hereby made compelling the Joint guardians (Alice Wangare Chege and Damaris Mugure Mwangi) to forthwith, and not later than 10.00 am on 29
th
 March 2024, to present the original Title Deed of the Parcel of Land commonly known as Bahati/Bahati Block 1/XXXX to the Deputy Registrar of the High Court to be kept under “lock and key” pending resolution of any disputes as may arise during guardianship.






35.
An Order is hereby made on behalf of “the subject”, that both Applicants and Respondents and the larger family of JGN (Deceased) shall jointly and in unison conduct the burial and funeral rights as scheduled for the 29
th
 February 2024 to take place on All that parcel Commonly Known as Bahati/Bahati Block 1/XXXX






36.
The Parties shall Appear for mention for further directions on ______________________






37.
This being a family matter there shall be no orders as to costs.
It is so Ordered

Titus Kyalo Kilindi


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (From the conviction and sentence in Sexual Offence Case No. 23 of 2020 at Wundanyi Law Court on 12th January, 2021 by Hon. E. M. Nyakundi - RM)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant was convicted of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006, the particulars of which being that on 3
rd
 July 2020 at around 0700hours at [particulars withheld] in Mwachabo Location, Mwatate Sub County in Taita Taveta County intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of CA a child aged 12 years.






2.
On conviction, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.






3.
Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, the appellant has come to this court on appeal and relied on the grounds of appeal filed on 15
th
 February 2022, that:-
1.
That the trial Magistrate erred when he convicted him yet failed to resolve material contradictions in the prosecution case in his favour.
2.
The trial Magistrate erred when he convicted him yet failed to observe that this was a family matter of a grudge.
3.
The trial Magistrate erred in convicting him yet failed to find that he was not served with P3 form.
4.
The Magistrate erred in convicting him yet failed to see that the investigating officer testified on phone and the appellant did not hear him well and hear his response to cross-examination.
5.
The trial Magistrate erred in convicting him on poor investigations.
6.
The trial Magistrate erred in convicting him in the case having discrepancies between the date of the incident and evidence before the court.
7.
That he was not afforded a fair trial by the trial court.






4.
The appeal was canvassed through written submissions. In this regard, I have perused and considered the submissions filed by the appellant as well as the submissions filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I note that the appellant has dwelt in his submissions only on the constitutionality of the sentence imposed, while the Director of Public Prosecution has addressed the issue of the conviction.






5.
This is a first appeal, and the grounds of appeal and submissions seem to cover both conviction and sentence. As a first appellant court I have to remind myself of my duty to evaluate all the evidence on record afresh and come to my own conclusions and inferences – see Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32.






6.
I also have to remind myself that the burden was on the prosecution to prove all the elements of the offence against the appellant. Such legal burden is codified under Section 107, 108 and 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 (Cap.80).






7.
Coming back to conviction, though I am duty bound to evaluate the evidence on record afresh if conviction is a ground of appeal, and as the Prosecuting Counsel has addressed conviction at length, in the present appeal I will not address the issue of adequacy of evidence and conviction, as the appellant clearly abandoned the grounds on conviction in submissions, when he specifically stated as follows in the submissions:-
“
The applicant charged and convicted with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 in Criminal Case number 244 of 2014 at Wundanyi PM’s court and sentenced to fifteen (15) years imprisonment on 20
th
 day of January 2021.
The applicant is not challenging his conviction but is challenging the legality of the enactment and the application of the mandatory minimum sentence as provided by Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.”






8.
In my view, the import of the above submission of the appellant (described as applicant) is clear that he abandoned his appeal against conviction and is now only challenging the sentence. I thus go by that, and address only the issue of sentence.






9.
With regard to the sentence imposed, the appellant was convicted under Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






10.
In sentencing him the trial court took into account that Section 8(3) of the Act provides for a minimum sentence of 20 years. The Magistrate however referred to the case of Muruatetu v Republic a decision of the Supreme Court and in exercise of what he described as discretion, sentenced the appellant to 15 years imprisonment after taking into account that the victim was 12 years old.






11.
In my view therefore, the appellant should have considered himself lucky for the liberal position adopted by the trial court and the consequent sentence imposed, which obviously is below the statutory minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment.






12.
I will not enhance the sentence however, as there is no such request made.






13.
Otherwise I find no merits in the appeal. I dismiss the appeal and uphold the sentence imposed by the trial court. Right of appeal 14 days explained.

2.

st
 Respondent is a national sports organization recognized as the national aquatics sports association in Kenya.






3.
The 2
nd
 to 10
th
 Respondents are the elected officials of the 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board.






4.

Facts


5.
While the Tribunal’s interaction with this matter began on 5
th
 November 2023, the history of this dispute commenced two years prior.






6.
On 18
th
 March 2021, two petitioners, Margaret Ndung’u-Mwasha and Conrad Dermot Biltcliffe Thorpe approached the High Court through a petition dated 18
th
 March 2021 (‘the petition’) alleging irregularities and illegalities during the promulgation of a constitution for Kenya Swimming Federation (‘KSF’) passed on 9
th
 January 2021. They alleged that the making of the constitution had no participation from the stakeholders of KSF and had provisions that were contrary to the Constitution of Kenya and the Sports Act. They also alleged irregularities and illegalities of elections planned to take place on 20
th
 March 2021 further to the impugned provisions of the constitution. The petition sought, among other things, a declaration that the constitution promulgated on 9
th
 January 2021 was in contravention of the Constitution of Kenya and a permanent injunction restraining the 1
st
 Respondent and its officials, agents, employees or any person acting on its behalf from inviting applications for election to the 1
st
 Respondent’s Executive Committee or holding elections for the same or in any way making changes to the leadership of the 1
st
 Respondent according to the impugned constitution or without following due process.






5.
The petition was accompanied by an application for interim injunction restraining KSF from planning or holding elections pending the hearing and determination of the petition. The High Court issued orders on 19
th
 March 2021, granting an interim injunction against KSF and its agents.






6.
On 18
th
 October 2021, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 interested parties in Petition E088 of 2021 approached the court to have the interim injunction reviewed and set aside.






7.
The High Court ruled on the application on 1
st
 February 2022, dismissing it in its entirety. The court stated that the claim that minors’ rights were being violated on account of the swimming activities coming to a stop were unsubstantiated and that there was no error on the face of the record that would warrant a review or setting aside.






8.
In June 2022, World Aquatics (‘FINA’) appointed a Stabilization Committee to run all day-to-day operations of the KSF, citing numerous FINA Bureau violations on KSF’s part, especially the organisations continued failure to hold elections. The Stabilization Committee began sending out notices in June 2023 in preparation for elections to KSF’s board, despite the injunction issued by the High Court.






9.
The petitioners filed an application seeking to cite members of the Stabilization Committee for contempt of court (‘the contempt application’) at the High Court dated 21
st
 June 2023. The application specifically cited Moses B Mwase, Jace Naidoo, Francis Mutuku and Michael Otieno.. This application was based on the letter dated 2
nd
 June 2023 which had invited members to apply for and nominate delegates for elections to KSF’s executive board.






10.
KSF went ahead to hold elections on 7
th
 October 2023 (‘the elections’), appointing the 2
nd
 to 10
th
 Respondents to its executive board.






11.
Aggrieved by the results of the elections, the Appellant approached this Tribunal.








B. Pleadings And Preliminaries:


14.
Mr. Isaac Alouch Polo Aluochier filed a Notice of Appeal before this Tribunal on 5
th
 November 2023. In the appeal brief, the Appellant prayed:
i.
That the Tribunal declares the election results to be null, void and invalid, in total, and that the 2
nd
 to the 10
th
 Respondents are not officials of the 1
st
 Respondent as a consequence of the declaration made on 7
th
 October 2023 so declaring them to be officials of the 1
st
 Respondent, and for the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents to pay the Appellants costs






14.
Such prayer was based on the following grounds:
a.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board elections were held, and the election results declared, in contravention of a then existing and still existing, injunctive order of the High Court dated 19
th
 March 2021, issued in High Court Petition No. e088 of 2021, Margaret Mwasha-Ndung’u & another v Kenya Swimming Federation & 3 others
b.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board elections were not conducted in a manner compliant with paragraphs (a), (d) and (g) of the Second Schedule of the Sports Act, 2013 as read together with section 46(5) of the said Act.
c.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board elections were not conducted in a manner compliant with the mandatory provisions of regulation 20 of the Sports Registrar’s Regulations, 2016






16.
The 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents in turn filed a preliminary objection dated 15
th
 November 2023 asking this Tribunal to dismiss the appeal, alleging that the facts and issues in this matter were before the High Court in the petition and the contempt application. The 5
th
 Respondent filed a replying affidavit on 30
th
 November 2023 in support of this preliminary objection, in which he alleged that all the grounds of appeal before this Tribunal were issues that were substantially before the High Court and as such were sub judice.






17.
The 11
th
 Respondent on her part filed a Replying Affidavit dated 19
th
 January 2024 in which she deponed that she objected to the elections held by the Stabilization Committee and prayed that the election results be declared invalid. The Appellant admitted that there was no cause of action against the 11
th
 Respondent, but that she is a party to the suit only because of the legal requirement for her office to participate in elections of national sports organisations. To the Appellant, this meant that she could assist this Tribunal to establish facts that she may be privy to in that by dint of the office she holds.






18.
The Panel ruled on the preliminary objection raised by the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents on 20
th
 February 2024 and dismissed the preliminary objection as it invited this Tribunal to probe issues of fact instead of being based on a pure point of law.






19.
The 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents then lodged an application for stay of proceedings dated 25
th
 March 2024 based on the same issue of sub judice. In a ruling dated 28
th
 May 2024, the Panel found that the subject matter of the petition and application before the High Court was different from that of this appeal and dismissed the application for stay.






20.
Having done so, the matter proceeded to hearing.








C. Parties’ Submissions


21.
The 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents filed submissions on 5
th
 December 2023 wherein they urged this Tribunal to find that this appeal and the contempt application arise from the same facts and challenge the same outcome of the facts in issue and the decision of the High Court will be binding on both the issues raised in that application and this present appeal. Additionally, they buttressed their position by arguing that paragraphs 32, 39, 47 and 48 of the petition addressed the same issues as the second and third grounds of appeal before this Tribunal. They relied on Republic vs Paul Kihara Kariuki, Attorney General & 2 others Ex-parte Law Society of Kenya (2020)eKLR to state various propositions, including that it is abuse of court process where two actions are commenced, the second asking for a relief which may have been obtained in the first.






22.
The Appellant filed submissions on 10
th
 July 2024, where he argued that the only issue raised in the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents’ submissions was whether the granting of orders or any decision in the petition will operate as res judicata in this appeal. His position was that it would not, as it was highly unlikely that the petition would be determined before this Tribunal rendered a decision. He pointed out that the next activity in the petition would be highlighting of submissions scheduled to take place on 24
th
 September 2024. Furthermore, the Appellant argued that the issues of res judicata had already been considered by this Tribunal in determining the preliminary objection and the application for stay of proceedings. He reasoned that arguments on these issues could not be reopened unless the Respondents requested a review of them. Therefore, the only remaining issues for the Tribunal to apply itself to would be the grounds of his appeal, the facts of which he noted had not been contested by any Respondent.








D. Issues For Determination
I. Whether the matter is sub-judice


23.
The 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents’ submissions allege that the matter is sub-judice, on account of the petition before the High Court and the accompanying contempt application.






24.
It does not escape the attention of this Tribunal that the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents have raised the issue of sub-judice in an unsuccessful preliminary objection and an unsuccessful stay of proceedings application. The preliminary objection was dismissed as it invited the Panel to probe issues of fact, which is antithetical to the nature of preliminary objections as conceptualised by Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co Ltd vs West End Distributors Ltd (1969) EA 696.






25.
When the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents filed an application to stay these proceedings on account of the same alleged sub-judice, this Tribunal considered this issue, giving the parties ample opportunity to ventilate their respective positions. The 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents filed their submissions dated 15
th
 April 2024 and the Appellant filed his submissions on 17
th
 April 2024. Having considered both parties’ averments and canvassing the issue of sub-judice at length, the Panel dismissed the application for stay on 28
th
 May 2024.






26.
This Tribunal has therefore already deliberated on the question of sub-judice in these proceedings and determined it. Considering the issue afresh in its final judgement would be tantamount to having this Tribunal sit on appeal over its own decision and re-open matters that are res judicata.






27.
We note that Section 7 of the Civil Procedure Act provides:
No court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.






23.
In Njue Ngai v Ephantus Njiru Ngai & another [2016] eKLR, the Court of Appeal had the following to say about res judicata:
‘What is res judicata and when does it apply? The Latin of it is simply “a thing adjudicated”. But it has overtime received extensive judicial interpretation in various jurisdictions of the globe which we shall not be tempted to explore here. Suffice it to adopt the definition in Black’s Law Dictionary, Ninth edition, as:
(i)
An issue that has been definitively settled by judicial decision;
(ii)
An affirmative defence barring the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim or any other claim arising from the same transaction, or series of transactions and that could have been –but was not- raised in the first suit.’






23.
The Court went further to address the question of whether matters settled in interlocutory proceedings can be considered res judicata and found as follows: ‘An issue may then arise from that section as to whether interlocutory proceedings, appeals or civil proceedings other than suits commenced by plaint are covered under the section or under the general principle of res judicata. The Uhuru Highway Development Limited v Central Bank of Kenya & 2 others [1996] eKLR, (supra) which is relied on by the appellant, extensively discussed the issue and particularly whether the principle of res judicata applied to an application heard and determined in the same suit. In other words, whether a matter of interlocutory nature decided in one suit can be subject of another similar application in the same suit. The Court held that the principle was applicable and that Section 7 was but an aspect of the general principle, stating thus:
“
..there must be an end to applications of similar nature; that is to say further, wider principles of res judicata apply to applications within the suit. If that was not the intention, we can imagine that the courts could and would be inundated by new applications filed after the original one was dismissed. There must be an end to interlocutory applications as much as there ought to be an end to litigation. It is this precise problem that section 89 of our Civil Procedure Act caters for.
The word “suit” is defined in section 2 of our Civil Procedure Act as:
“Means all civil proceedings commenced in a any manner prescribed.”
Also the word “prescribed” has been defined to mean “prescribed by rules” and “rules” are defined to mean “rules and forms made by the Rules Committee to regulate the procedure of the courts”. What stands out as most important here is that section 89 of our Civil Procedure Act makes it mandatory to follow the procedure provided in the Act makes it mandatory to follow the procedure provided in the Act to all proceedings in any Court of Civil jurisdiction. That can only mean that interlocutory proceedings come within the purview of the word “suit” for the purpose of the issue of res judicata by virtue of section 89 of our Civil Procedure Act”.…….. “We have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that the general principles of res judicata cannot be limited by section 7 of the Civil Procedure Act and that the section (Section 7) is not exhaustive.”’ (Emphasis theirs)






30.
From the foregoing, it is clear that once the issue of sub judice was dispensed with in the ruling of 28
th
 May 2024, it became res judicata.






31.
It follows then that this Tribunal is functus officio in that regard. The edicts of the Supreme Court in Odinga v Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission & 3 others (Petition 5, 4 & 3 of 2013) [2013] KESC 8 (KLR) (Civ) (24 October 2013) (Ruling) state aptly that:
‘The functus officio doctrine is one of the mechanisms by means of which the law gives expression to the principle of finality. According to this doctrine, a person who is vested with adjudicative or decision-making powers may, as a general rule, exercise those powers only once in relation to the same matter.… The [principle] is that once such a decision has been given, it is (subject to any right of appeal to a superior body or functionary) final and conclusive. Such a decision cannot be revoked or varied by the decision-maker.’ (Emphasis theirs)






32.
Accordingly, we find no need to revisit the issue of sub judice.








II. Whether the 1
st
 Respondent’s election results are null, void and invalid in total


33.
In the appeal brief dated 5
th
 November 2023, the Appellant asked this Tribunal to annul the election results on three grounds:
i.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board elections were held and the results declared in contravention of a then existing and still existing injunctive order of the High Court
ii.
The elections were not compliant with paragraphs (a), (d) and (g) of the Second Schedule of the Sports Act 2013 as read with Section 46(5) of the same
iii.
The elections were not compliant with mandatory provisions of regulation 20 of the Sport’s Registrar’s Regulations 2016 34. These grounds are addressed in turn as follows:








i. Whether the elections are invalid due to the existing injunctive order


35.
Article 2(1) of the Constitution declares it the supreme law of the land that binds all persons and all state organs at both levels of government. Article 159 of the Constitution of Kenya vests judicial authority in the courts to exercise the sovereign power of the people. Section 3A of the Civil Procedure Act buttresses the power of the court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of court. Furthermore, Section 3 of the Judicature Act vests jurisdiction in the courts to exercise their power in conformity with the Constitution of Kenya and all other written laws.






36.
The High Court in Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance v Cabinet Secretary for Devolution and Planning & 3 others [2017] eKLR found:
‘It cannot be disputed that an order of the court has to be respected by the parties who are bound by it. Therefore every effort must be made to implement the order of the court and not to disobey the same. It is not up to that party to choose whether to comply or not to comply with such an order. The order must be complied with in totality, in all circumstances by the party concerned, subject to the party’s right to challenge the order in issue, in such a lawful way as the law permits.
The purpose of this is simple. It is to protect the sanctity of the courts of judicature, which is well envisaged in the Constitution; sustain the confidence in the third arm of government so that all the people who feel aggrieved by government, its agencies or private persons can have a place to run to for a neutral determination. To disregard court orders therefore, among others in my view, is by implication, to set the precedent that people should not believe in the courts. This is wrong because it puts persons in our country on a collision course with no remedy thus creating a medium in which they descend into anarchy by resorting to taking the law into their hands. This is in utter disregard of the democratic and good governance principles and values enshrined in our Constitution.
It is trite that the court will not condone or enforce an illegality.’ I think it is important to bear in mind that Article 259 (1) of the constitution enjoins the court to interpret the constitution in a manner that promotes its purposes, values and principles, advances the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in the bill of rights and in a manner that contributes to good governance. This court is obliged under Article 159 (2) (e) of the constitution to protect and promote the purposes and principles of the constitution. Also, the constitution should be given a purposive, liberal interpretation. I stand guided by the clear provisions of the constitution which is the supreme law of the land which binds all persons and all state organs.’ (Emphasis ours)






37.
The High Court in Econet Wireless Kenya Ltd vs. Minister for Information & Communication of Kenya & Another [2005] 1 KLR 828 cited with approval the case of Gulabchand Popatlal Shah & Another Civil Application No. 39 Of 1990, (unreported), where the Court of Appeal stated:
‘It is essential for the maintenance of the Rule of Law and good order that the authority and dignity of our courts are upheld at all times.’






38.
We do not think it bears much reiteration that orders of the High Court given in the exercise of its judicial authority bind all persons to which it is directed. The Appellant provided uncontroverted proof that there was an injunctive order from the High Court that barred the elections, providing inter alia:
‘That temporary order of injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the 1
st
 Respondent and or its officials and or its agents and or its employees or anyone purporting to act on its behalf from inviting applications for election to the Respondent’s executive board and or conducting election for members of the Respondent’s Executive Board and or any way purporting to effect changes in the leadership of Respondent Executive Board pending hearing and determination of the instant Application’






39.
There has been no evidence submitted before this Tribunal that the order was set aside, reviewed, appealed, or was otherwise not in force when the various notices for the planning and execution of the elections were sent out in June 2023 or when the elections took place in October 2023.






40.
As such, we find that the 1
st
 Respondent, being bound by the orders of the High Court orders, had no capacity to hold elections for its executive board and that the 2
nd
 to 10
th
 Respondents could not then have been validly and lawfully elected.








ii. Whether the elections were compliant with the Sports Act and in particular, paragraphs (a), (d) and (g) of the Second Schedule as read with Section 46(5) of the Sports Act


41.
Section 46(5) of the Sports Act provides:
A constitution submitted under subsection (3) shall contain, as a basic minimum, the provisions set out in the Second Schedule.






42.
The relevant provisions of the Second Schedule are as follows: Paragraph (a) of the Second Schedule;
elections of officials and athlete’s representatives at the national, branch and sub-branch levels shall be done directly by club members; Paragraph (d) of the Second Schedule;
elections shall be held in accordance with the general principles for the electoral system as stipulated in Article 81 of the Constitution; Paragraph (g) of the Second Schedule;
that the election of officials at national, branch and sub-branch levels shall be done directly and only registered club members are entitled to vote at those elections;






43.
The import of Section 46(5) is that these provisions are mandatory and cannot be varied. Therefore, the provisions of the Second Schedule operate as the rules applicable to elections held by a national sports organisation.






44.
The Second Schedule of the Sports Act also makes reference to the general principles of the electoral system as provided for in Article 81 of the
Constitution as follows;
The electoral system shall comply with the following principles—
a.
freedom of citizens to exercise their political rights under Article 38;
b.
not more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender;
c.
fair representation of persons with disabilities;
d.
universal suffrage based on the aspiration for fair representation and equality of vote; and
e.
free and fair elections, which are—
i.
by secret ballot;
ii.
free from violence, intimidation, improper influence or corruption;
iii.
conducted by an independent body;
iv.
transparent; and
v.
administered in an impartial, neutral, efficient, accurate and accountable manner.






45.
To interpret the provisions of the Sports Act, we refer to the judgement of Supreme Court in Mwicigi & 14 others v Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 5 others (Petition 1 of 2015) [2016] KESC 2 (KLR) (26 April 2016) (Judgment) where it clarified the different methods of election available in the Constitution:
‘It is clear to us that the Constitution provides for two modes of ‘election’. The first is election in the conventional sense, of universal suffrage; the second is ‘election’ by way of nomination, through the party list. It follows from such a conception of the electoral process, that any contest to an election, whatever its manifestation, is to be by way of ‘election petition’.’






46.
The mode of election provided for in the Sports Act is as set out under Rule 20 of the Sports Registrar’s Rules which provides that “An organization shall hold an election in accordance with the Rules provided in its constitution”.






47.
The Appellant, however, relies on the Second Schedule to the Sports Act for the proposition that all eligible voters have the right to vote directly for elected officials. Eligibility in this context is premised on voters being registered club members, as per paragraph (g) of the Second Schedule. Thus, any registered club member was eligible to vote in the elections for the 1
st
 Respondent’s executive board.






48.
The Appellant alleges that contrary to the provision in the Second Schedule, the elections of the 2
nd
 to 10
th
 Respondents were conducted through delegates.






49.
In support, the Appellant submits written protests taken at the meeting held on 7
th
 October 2023 where the delegates signed the roll-call and three parties wrote on the same paper that they objected to the elections.






50.
Furthermore, the 5
th
 Respondent’s Replying Affidavit dated 30
th
 November 2023 attached evidence vide the annexure marked CM-1, which contains further evidence of the manner in which the elections took place.






51.
We make reference to the letter dated 2
nd
 June 2023 from the Stabilization Committee signed by the Secretary of the same of the inviting club members to ‘submit names of only 2 (two) delegates each’ for the upcoming elections to the executive board, reaffirming that ‘clubs are eligible to nominate delegates’. This letter was accompanied by election guidelines which provided in clause 6 for eligible voters, limiting them to clubs, counties, athletes’ representatives and members of the World Aquatics or Africa Aquatics.






52.
We also make reference to the letter dated 5
th
 June 2023 from the Stabilization Committee signed by its Secretary, inviting counties and clubs to ‘submit names of only 2 (two) delegates each’ and further that clubs are ‘eligible to nominate delegates’ in order to ‘exercise their voting rights’. It states in the last paragraph that the Chairperson of clubs and counties should confirm attendance and indicate in writing ‘two delegates… the voting and the non-voting delegate)’.






53.
The contest therefore is between the provisions of the Second Schedule to the Act and the Sports Registrar’s Regulations, 2016.






54.
We are unable to conclude that the elections were held in contravention of the of Section 46(5) of the Sports Act, as read with paragraphs (a), (d), and (g) of the Second Schedule or that the results could be invalidated on this ground.








iii. The elections were not compliant with mandatory provisions of Regulation 20 of the Sport’s Registrar’s Regulations 2016


55.
The Appellant also claims that the elections were held in contravention of Regulations 20(2) (a), (b), (d), (e), 20(3), 20(4) and 20(5) of the Sports Registrar’s Regulations.






56.
For context, Regulation 20(1) reads ‘an organization shall hold election in accordance with the Rules provided in its constitution’ and Regulation 20(2) then provides ‘notwithstanding paragraph (1), a sports organization seeking to hold an election shall’ after which it provides for certain requirements to be met. The intention of Regulation 20(2) is therefore to ensure that notwithstanding the rules of each individual organisation’s constitution, certain criteria must be fulfilled to hold valid elections.






57.
Regulation 20(2)(a) stipulates that national sports organisations must appoint independent panel of at least five members to conduct the election. The Appellant alleges that no such panel was appointed and invokes a letter from the 11
th
 Respondent, the Sports Registrar, dated 27
th
 October 2023 in support. In this letter, the Sports Registrar references the lack of an independent panel during the elections but she also indicates that the elections were conducted without her ‘knowledge, notice and invitation’, which would impede her ability to ascertain whether or not an independent panel conducted the elections.






58.
We also note that in the letter dated 2
nd
 June 2023 from the Stabilization Committee, election guidelines were attached which provided in clause 7 that ‘election shall be conducted under the supervision of an impartial panel of 5 (five) individuals to be approved by Members by [sic: of] the General Assembly of the Federation’ and similarly in clause 13.6 that ‘elections shall be conducted under the supervision of an impartial panel of 5 individuals nominated by the Executive Board and approved by the preceding General Assembly before the elective Assembly’.






59.
We recognise that the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents do not controvert the allegation that there was no independent panel present at the elections but nevertheless, the Appellant must still provide cogent evidence to satisfy this Tribunal of the facts it alleges. Given the lack of a detailed account from a party that was present or actively involved in the planning and execution of the elections, this Tribunal finds the submissions on the absence of an independent panel to be insufficiently unsubstantiated and vague.






60.
Regulation 20(2)(b) provides sports organisations must include observers from at least one umbrella sport organization, the Ministry responsible for matters related to sports and the Registrar’s office. The Appellant alleges that none of these observers were present. Though he admits that Mr. Francis Mutuku, the Secretary General of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya, was present the Appellant claims that he was there in his capacity as a member of the Stabilization Committee and that observers must be distinct from organisers. We find that the capacity in which Mr. Mutuku attended the elections is of no consequence, as both the Registrar and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports were absent. The Sports Registrar confirms her own absence in her replying affidavit dated 19
th
 January 2024 and alludes to the non-involvement of the Ministry of Youth Affairs of Sports by which she is employed. In any event, the regulation provides for the presence of all three parties and the absence of even one is therefore a violation of the provision.






61.
In the case of Richard Omwela, Chairman & 2 others (suing on behalf of the Kenya Rugby Union) v Sports Registrar [2019] eKLR, this Tribunal rendered a decision in which it stated the importance of the supervisory provisions in the Sports Act:
‘The essence of the requirement for supervision of elections is to safeguard against the potential for federations being ‘hijacked’ by cliques and to ensure or allow federation’s affiliates and members who constitute its electoral congress to exercise their will freely and fairly.
The various provisions both in the Schedule to the Act and the Regulations with respect to elections are well intended to safeguard and infuse good governance in Sports Federations.’






62.
Regulation 20(2)(d) provides that sports organisations must inform the Registrar four weeks prior to the expected date of elections. The Registrar confirms receiving a notice on 5
th
 June 2023 for elections scheduled for 8
th
 July 2023 but reports voicing her concerns over the planned elections in a letter dated 21
st
 June 2023. The impugned elections took place on 7
th
 October 2023 but there is no proof that the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents issued a second notice to the Registrar informing her of the same.






63.
Regulation 20(2)(e) mandates that elections be conducted in an open, free, and fair environment. The Appellant contends that this standard was not met due to the existing injunctive order. We have already addressed the implications of that injunction on the election results and need not repeat those findings. Nevertheless, we agree that elections conducted in contravention of a court order cannot be said to uphold the principles of transparency, inclusivity and adherence to the rule of law that the Regulation envisions.






64.
Regulation 20(3) provides that an observer and the returning officer of the elections must submit a report to the Registrar on the credibility of the elections. Regulation 20(4) mandates that the sports organisation must also notify the Registrar within 21 days of the newly elected officials. The Registrar’s letter of 27
th
 October 2023 is proof that neither of these post-election steps were effected and the 1
st
 to 10
th
 Respondents provide no evidence to challenge this.






65.
Regulation 20(5) empowers the Registrar to register a new office bearer if satisfied with the election process. In the letter dated 27th October 2023, the Registrar expressed concerns regarding the conduct of the elections and indicated a reluctance to register the names of the newly elected officials. This decision lies within the Registrar’s discretion and we hesitate to base the invalidity of the results solely on this provision but we nonetheless find the Registrar’s reservations compelling evidence of the irregularities that mar the elections held.






66.
In sum, we find that the elections were not compliant with the mandatory provisions of the Sports Registrar’s Regulations, particularly Regulations 20(2)(b), 20(2)(d), 20(2)(e), 20(3) and 20(4).








E. Disposition


67.
The issue of sub judice in these proceedings is res judicata.






68.
The election results declaring the 2
nd
 to 10
th
 Respondents the elected officials of the 1
st
 Respondent are invalid for being held in contravention of the court’s injunction dated 19
th
 March 2021.






69.
We are unable to find that the election results were invalid for being noncompliant with Section 46(5) of the Sports Act and the mandatory provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (g) of the Second Schedule to the Sports Act.






70.
Finally, we are satisfied that the elections did not comply with Regulations 20(2)(b). 20(2)(d), 20(2)(e), 20(3) and 20(4), which are mandatory provisions of the Sports Registrar’s Regulations, the result of which also renders these elections invalid.






71.
Costs are hereby awarded to the Appellant as prayed.

Ruling










1.
Upon perusing the Originating Motion dated 8
th
 March, 2024 and filed on 26
th
 April, 2024 by the applicants pursuant to Rule 33 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2020 seeking review of the Court of Appeal’s ruling dated 23
rd
 February, 2024 in Mombasa Civil Applic. No. E003 of 2022 which declined to certify that the applicants’ intended appeal to this Court raises issues of general public importance; and






2.
Cognisant of the pertinent facts which culminated in this Motion to wit, that despite TMG (the 1
st
 applicant) and RAP (P) celebrating a monogamous marriage before the Registrar of Marriages; on 19
th
 March 2003, P left for the United States on the very same day and never returned; the 1
st
 applicant commenced divorce proceedings seeking nullification of the said marriage on the ground that the marriage was not consummated, which proceedings are still pending before the Kilifi Chief Magistrate’s Court; the 1
st
 applicant was blessed with QFG (a minor) on 15
th
 November, 2005 from a different relationship; thereafter, in 2008 the 1
st
 applicant and AP (the respondent) began an intimate relationship and moved in together in a 3-bedroom house in Mtwapa which was registered in both their names; and that they however sold the house and shared the proceeds thereof. Subsequently, in 2011, the respondent purchased a parcel of land referred to as CR 40958/7 sub division 17235 (Original No. 13324/4 of Section I Mainland North) (the suit property) situated in Shanzu, and erected a residential house thereon; and the applicants moved into the suit property in 2014 but the relationship between the 1
st
 applicant and the respondent came to an end in 2016. As a result, the respondent served the 1
st
 applicant with a notice to vacate the suit property.






3.
Consequently, the applicants filed a suit in the High Court against the respondent being, Mombasa Matrimonial Property Cause No. 1 of 2016, which was premised on the grounds that, the 1
st
applicant and the respondent lived as husband and wife; the respondent had accepted to take up parental responsibility over the 2
nd
 applicant, as evidenced by adoption proceedings, Mombasa HC Adoption Cause No. 5 of 2013, which is still pending; the suit property was purchased for the sole aim of setting up their matrimonial home, and upon its completion the respondent moved the applicants therein; and as such, the applicants sought “a permanent injunction restraining the defendant (the respondent herein), his agents, servants and/or employees from interfering with the plaintiffs’ (the applicants herein) use and enjoyment of the suit property; and a declaration that the 1
st
 plaintiff (1
st
 applicant herein) has an equitable interest in the suit property”; and






4.
Noting that the respondent denied the applicants’ allegations and contended that, the 1
st
 applicant received the lion’s share of the sale proceeds of the house in Mtwapa in order to build a house for both herself and the 2
nd
 applicant; he purchased and developed the suit property for resale; he only allowed the applicants to move into the suit property for a short period as the 1
st
 applicant was putting up her home, which she never did; he never took up parental responsibility over the 2
nd
 applicant, and he not only abandoned the adoption process but also broke off the relationship upon discovering that the 1
st
 applicant was married; therefore, the respondent through a counterclaim prayed for a “declaration that no marriage existed between the respondent and the 1
st
 applicant; a declaration that the respondent has no obligation to maintain the applicants; and an order for delivery of vacant possession of the suit property to the respondent”; and






5.
Further noting that the High Court (Thande, J.) by a judgment dated 10
th
 April, 2019 found that, the marriage between the 1
st
 applicant and P still subsists since the divorce proceedings before Kilifi Chief Magistrate’s Court had not been finalised; therefore, the 1
st
 applicant lacked the capacity to enter into another marriage, and equally, no presumption of a marriage could arise with respect to her relationship with the respondent as it would be tantamount to sanctioning bigamy; in the circumstances, the suit property was neither matrimonial property nor was there evidence that the respondent held the same in trust for the 1
st
 applicant; the respondent did not follow through the adoption process and there was nothing to demonstrate that the respondent’s relationship with the 2
nd
 applicant was akin to that of a parent. In the end, the court dismissed the applicant’s suit and allowed the respondent’s counterclaim in the following terms:
a.
No marriage exists between the 1
st
 applicant and the respondent.
b.
The respondent has no obligation to maintain the applicants.
c.
The applicants shall deliver to the respondent vacant possession of the suit property within 3 months and in any event not later than 31
st
 July, 2019.
d.
The circumstances of this case do not call for award of costs. I therefore direct that each party bears its own cost; and






6.
Appreciating that the applicants challenged the High Court’s decision in the Court of Appeal, Mombasa Civil Appeal No. 138 of 2019, which appeal was dismissed by a judgment dated 6
th
 May, 2022; subsequently, the applicants filed a Notice of Motion dated 13
th
 May, 2022 before the same court seeking certification that their intended appeal to this Court against the Court of Appeal judgment (impugned judgment) raises issues of general public importance; and by a ruling dated 23
rd
 February 2024, the Court of Appeal (Murgor, Laibuta & Odunga, JJ.A.) declined to issue the certification and dismissed the said Motion; and






7.
Upon considering the affidavit sworn by the 1
st
 applicant, on 8
th
 March, 2024 in support of the instant Motion and the applicants’ submissions dated 22
nd
 April 2024 to the effect that; society has overtime accepted and recognised what they termed as “unconventional’’ relationships such as that of the 1
st
 applicant and the respondent; that such relationships are now commonplace and regarded as presumed valid marriages/unions; that in their view, the 
Law of Succession Act
 recognises the right of women in such relationships to inherit from the estate of the deceased husband who had initially celebrated a monogamous marriage; it was unfair for the superior courts below to find that the 1
st
 applicant and respondent’s marriage was non-existent simply because the 1
st
 applicant’s marriage with P had not been nullified; the applicants at all material times relied on the respondent’s promise that the suit property would constitute the matrimonial home; and the issues sought to be raised in the intended appeal transcend the circumstances of the dispute between the parties; and






8.
Whereas the applicants did not specifically set out in their Motion the issues they deem to be of general public importance, but instead, in their written submissions urged this Court to pronounce itself with finality on the following issues:
i.
Whether the doctrine of presumption of marriage can apply in matrimonial property causes;
ii.
Whether the failure to consummate a registered (monogamous) marriage deprives a party to the marriage capacity to enter a subsequent marriage with another person;
iii.
Whether a party can rely on the fact he or she is already married to avoid sharing of matrimonial property pursuant to Article 53(3) of 
the Constitution
;
iv.
Whether secluding cohabitees from the Matrimonial Properties Act contravenes their rights enshrined in Articles 27,28, 40 and 43 of 
the Constitution
 (sic);
v.
Whether constructive parental responsibility lapses where parties who have already shown their intention to relate to the child as parents part ways; and






9.
Upon examining the respondent’s grounds of opposition and submissions dated 6
th
 May, 2024 the tenor of which is that, the impugned judgment did not raise any matters of public importance; the issues intended to be raised were never raised or considered in the superior courts below, and in any event, the said issues are peculiar to the parties herein; therefore, the instant Motion is an abuse of the court’s process and should be dismissed; and






10.
Acknowleding that this Court has jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeal’s ruling declining certification as set out under Article 163(5) of 
the Constitution
 and Rule 33 (2) of the Supreme Court Rules; and that the parameters for such review are well settled in Hermanus Phillipus Steyn vs. Giovanni Gnecchi-Ruscone, SC App. No. 4 of 2012; [2013] eKLR and Malcolm Bell vs. Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi & Another, SC Appl. No. 1 of 2013 [2013] eKLR; and






11.
Upon deliberations on the Motion and the rival arguments, we opine as follows:
i.
It is trite that a matter(s) of general public importance which would warrant the exercise of this Court’s appellate jurisdiction under Article 163(4)(b) of 
the Constitution
 should transcend the dispute between the parties, and have a significant bearing upon public interest. Further, the onus lies with the applicants to demonstrate that the matter in question carries specific elements of real public interest and concern.
ii.
We cannot help but note that the applicants did not concisely set out the issues they deem are of general public importance in their Motion. Rather, they set out the issues in their written submissions. This Court has time and time again underscored the requirement and necessity of an intended appellant(s) to concisely set out the issues deemed to be of general importance as appreciated in Hermanus Phillipus Steyn vs. Giovanni Gnecchi-Ruscone (Supra). In short, the delineated issues form the basis upon which both the Court of Appeal and this Court determine whether indeed an intended appeal raises issues of general public importance which warrant this Court’s consideration. Therefore, we find that for proper order and notice to the other parties, an intended appellant, like the applicants, should concisely delineate the issue(s) of general public importance he/she deems arises from an impugned decision of the Court of Appeal not only in a Motion seeking certification but also in the instant Motion seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeal declining such certification. Be that as it may, do the issues set out in the applicants’ written submissions constitute issues of general public importance?
iii.
The applicants’ contention is that the superior courts below erred by finding that the 1
st
 applicant and respondent’s relationship was not a marriage simply because her marriage with P had not been nullified. We understand the applicants to argue that the superior courts below had failed to take into account that society has since accepted such relationships which they termed as “unconventional” relationships as giving rise to valid unions/marriages.
iv.
To begin with the applicants have not demonstrated that there is any lacuna or inconsistency with regard to what constitutes a valid marriage. In point of fact, as correctly observed by the superior courts below, the 
Marriage Act
 (Cap 150 Laws of Kenya) is clear on this issue. In particular Section 3 (1) of the Act defines a marriage as, “… a voluntary union of a man and a woman whether in a monogamous or polygamous union and registered in accordance with the Act”. Section 9 (a) thereof provides that-
“
9.
Subject to section 8, a married person shall not, while —
a.
in a monogamous marriage, contract another marriage; …”
Likewise, Section 11(1)(c) expressly speaks to the relationship between the 1
st
 applicant and the respondent in the following manner:
11.
Void marriages
1.
A union is not a marriage if at the time of the making of the union—
a.
either party is incompetent to marry by reason of a subsisting marriage; …”
v.
It is common ground that the applicants claim to the suit property was anchored on the contention that it was the matrimonial home. Similarly, the superior courts below found that the law is clear as to what constitutes a matrimonial home. In that regard, the courts found that since no marriage could be presumed between the 1
st
 applicant and the respondent, it followed that the suit property was not matrimonial property. The 
Matrimonial Property Act
 (Cap 152 Laws of Kenya) is quite explicit on what constitutes a matrimonial home. Section 2 thereof defines matrimonial home as follows:
“
‘matrimonial home’ means any property that is owned or leased by one or both spouses and occupied or utilized by the spouses as their family home, and includes any other attached property; …”
The said interpretive section also defines a spouse as –
“
‘spouse’ means a husband or a wife; …”
vi.
Looking at the issues that were before the superior courts below, we note that, as the Court of Appeal correctly observed, issues relating to violation of the applicants’ constitutional rights were never subject of the litigation before the said courts. Therefore, such issues cannot be raised for the first time at the point of seeking certification as appreciated in Thika Coffee 
Mills vs. Rwama Farmers’ Co-operative Society Limited (Application 11 of 2020
) [2020] KESC 17 (KLR). Moreover, allegations of the violation of Articles 28, 40 and 53(3) were not even raised by the applicants in their Motion seeking certification before the Court of Appeal. This Court in 
Wandabusi & Another vs. Attorney General for and on behalf of the Commissioner for Lands & 3 Others (Originating Motion 23 of 2017
) [2019] KESC 4 (KLR) held that an intended appellant cannot introduce new issues in a Motion seeking review of the Court of Appeal’s decision declining certification, when such issues had not been raised in the Motion for certification before the Court of Appeal.
vii.
In totality, we find that the instant Motion has fallen short of demonstrating to our satisfaction beyond a mere restatement that the intended appeal raises issues of general public importance. It is apparent that the intended appeal seeks to secure an interpretation of the law in the context of the peculiar facts of this case, which is beyond this Court’s appellate jurisdiction under Article 163(4)(b) of 
the Constitution
. Therefore, we find the instant Motion lacks merit and is hereby dismissed.
viii.
Taking into account the nature of this matter and this Court’s decision in Jasbir Singh 
Rai & 3 Others vs. Tarlochan Singh Rai & 4 Others, SC Petition No. 4 of 2012
; [2014] eKLR, we deem it just to order that each party bears his/her own costs.






12.
Consequently and for the reasons afore-stated, we make the following Orders:
i.
The Originating Motion dated 8
th
 March, 2024 and filed on 26
th
 April, 2024 is hereby dismissed.
ii.
Each party shall bear his/her own costs.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The Applicants have filed Originating Summons dated 28 May 2024, seeking the following orders:
i.
That the Applicants, S.M.W and L.N.K, be allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby G.M;
ii.
That henceforth, the child be renamed as J.S.W;
iii.
That the child’s date and place of birth be declared to be 3 August 2022 at Embu County;
iv.
That the child be presumed to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, and consequently be entitled to all the rights and benefits in respect thereof;
v.
That R.W.K. and D.K.G be appointed as legal guardians of the child, in the event that the Applicants herein are incapacitated or in any way unable to discharge their parental obligations;
vi.
That the Guardian ad litem be discharged;
vii.
That the Registrar General be directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;
viii.
That this Court do issue such further orders as are in the interest of justice






2.
The Summons is accompanied by a Statement in Support of the Application for an Adoption Order, Affidavit in Support of the Application and annextures thereto.






3.
The matter was canvassed by way of viva voce evidence on the virtual platform.






The Child


4.
The child (male) was born on 3 August 2022 in Embu County. The initial letter from Embu Police Station indicates that the child was found abandoned at the Embu Market Old Stores. The matter was reported vide OB No. 19/02/9/2022. The child was then committed to Angela Embu Children’s Home by the Children’s Court in Embu, Case No. E039 of 2022.






5.
The final letter from the Embu Police Station dated 12 July 2023 indicates that no one came forth to claim the child. The child was declared free for adoption by the Buckner Kenya Adoption Services, a registered Adoption Agency, vide the annexed Certificate serial number 0672. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met.








The Applicants


6.
The Applicants are Kenyan citizens, residing in Ruaka, Kiambu County. They are a couple, married for the last 18 years. The Applicants have one adopted daughter, aged 9 years. They are aged 46 and 45 years, respectively. The 1st Applicant is an ICT officer, while the 2nd Applicant is a full-time mom.






7.
The child was placed with the Applicants on 12 July 2023. The DCS Report and Guardian ad Litem Report indicate that the child has bonded well with the Applicants and the older sister. The Applicants confirmed that the immediate family has also accepted the child herein. Both Applicants confirmed that they are fully aware of the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.








The Biological Parents


8.
From the DCS Report dated 4 June 2024, the child was abandoned soon after birth. As confirmed by the Letters from Embu Police Station, efforts to trace the biological parents were futile. In the circumstances, there exists no known person from whom consent for this adoption can be sought and/or obtained. I, therefore, waive this requirement in line with section 185 (4)(b) of the 
Children Act
, Cap 141 of the Laws of Kenya.








The Adoption Application


9.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed to support the suitability of the Applicants as adoptive parents. The Applicants state that they are practising Christians and intend to raise the child in the Christian faith.






10.
The Applicants has annexed copies of bank statements, copies of 1st Applicant’s pay slips, copies of Share Certificates and Certificates of Allotment as proof of their financial stability. They have provided copies of clearance certificates from the Kenya Police Service and Recommendations letters as well in proof of their character and good standing.






11.
The Applicants presented R.W.K and D.K.G as proposed legal guardians for the child. The said legal guardians, a married couple, signed a consent Affidavit dated 28 May 2024 indicating their willingness to step in and care for the child in the event the Applicants is unable to provide for the child. R.W.K is a sister to the 2nd Applicant, while T.M.N is her brother-in-law. The proposed legal guardians confirmed that they understood their role and responsibilities.






12.
From the material availed, I am satisfied that the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.








Analysis and Determination


13.
Article 14 (4) of 
The Constitution
 provides as follows:
A child found in Kenya who is, or appears to be, less than 8 years of age, and whose nationality and parents are not know, is presumes to be a citizen by birth.






14.
The child was abandoned soon after birth. I, therefore, declare that the child is a citizen of Kenya by birth.






15.
In deciding any matter involving a child, the court is obligated to give priority to the best interest of the child. Section 8 of the 
Children Act
 provides:
1.
In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies –
a.
The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;
b.
The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule;
2.
All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to:-
a.
Safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;
b.
Conserve and promote the welfare of the child; and
c.
Secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in the public interest.






16.
I have considered the Reports filed by the Adoption Agency, the Guardian Ad Litem, the Director of Children Services, all of which were positive and recommended the adoption. It is, therefore, my view that the adoption does serve the best interests of the child.






17.
Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicants, S.M.W and L.N.K, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby G.M;
ii.
Upon adoption, the child shall be renamed as J.S.W;
iii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iv.
R.W.K and D.K.G are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,
v.
The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;
vi.
That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;

          (Appeal arising from the decision of Hon. Njoki Kahara S.R.M in the Magistrate’s Court at Siakago Sexual Offence No. E035 of 2022 delivered on 23rd November 2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1)(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. Particulars are that on 19
th
 August 2022 at 1400HRS at Gachuriri area, Gachuriri sublocation, Mbeti South location, Mbeere South Subcounty in Embu County, the appellant intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina and anus of PM a child aged 9 years. The alternative charge was committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006, whose particulars are that on 19
th
 August 2022 at 1400HRS at Gachuriri area, Gachuriri sublocation, Mbeti South location, Mbeere South Subcounty in Embu County, the appellant intentionally touched the anus and vagina of PM, a child aged 9 years with his penis.






2.
At the trial, the appellant pleaded ‘not guilty’ to the charge. The case proceeded to full trial and subsequently he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.






3.
The appellant, being dissatisfied with the decision of the trial court, filed a petition of appeal dated 13
th
 December 2023, seeking orders that the appeal be allowed, conviction quashed and the sentence of life imprisonment be set aside and that he be set at liberty. The appeal is premised on the grounds that:
a.
The learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by convicting the appellant without considering that the adduced prosecution evidence was inadequate to sustain conviction;
b.
The learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by convicting the appellant without considering the fact that the prosecution’s evidence was uncorroborated and was full of inconsistencies hence sections 163(1) of the 
Evidence Act
 was not complied with;
c.
The learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by disregarding the appellant’s defense without giving cogent reasons; and
d.
The learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by considering the prosecution’s evidence which was insufficient and unsatisfactory in law.
Further grounds of appeal as stated in the supplementary documents filed together with written submissions were as follows:
e.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and facts by convicting and sentencing the appellant based on the evidence of PW1 and PW2 which evidence was riddled with doubts, thus contravening sections 163(1) and 165 of the 
Evidence Act
;
f.
That the charge sheet was defective contrary to section 214 of the Criminal procedure Code;
g.
That the case was not proved beyond reasonable doubt as the DNA was not conclusive.






4.
A summary of the evidence adduced at the trial is as follows: PW1 was the complainant, a minor, who gave sworn testimony after voire dire. She identified the appellant as her assailant and she stated that on the day of the incident, the appellant was doing some painting at Mama Vyonne’s workshop. That the said Mama Vyonne called her and sent her to buy paraffin worth Kshs.100/= but when she brought it, it seemed too little. That Mama Vyonne asked the appellant to accompany PW1 back to the petrol station to enquire why the paraffin seemed less than what should cost Kshs.100/=. That while on the way back, the appellant knocked her ankles and she fell to the ground then he removed her undergarments, put them in his pocket, covered her mouth with a cloth and defiled her by inserting his penis into her vagina and her anus.






5.
That she felt pain and lied to him that she wanted to urinate but she used the chance to run away, leaving her shoes and undergarments behind. That she went and reported the incident to Mama Vyonne who accompanied her back to the scene where they found the appellant sitting on the ground and he said he did not know where the undergarments, were but Mama Vyonne found them in his pocket. She stated that Mama Vyonne called her mother who went to the scene and took her to Embu Level 5 Hospital and the matter was also reported to the police. On cross-examination, she stated that she had told the appellant twice that her mother had forbidden her from walking with men along isolated roads.






6.
PW2 was KM, the victim’s mother, who stated that her daughter was 10 years old at the time of the testimony and she produced an age assessment report as evidence. She stated that she knew the appellant since he lives in her neighborhood. She stated that on the day of the incident, all her 4 children were at home since they had been sent home from school for lack of school fees. That she received a phone call from Mama Vyonne informing her that PW1 had been defiled and she caught up with them at the sub-chief’s office. That after being prevailed upon by Mama Vyonne, the appellant removed PW1’s panty and biker from his pocket and he also showed them where he had hidden the victim’s shoes. That the appellant’s father was also present and the matter was reported at Gachoka Police Station. She stated that she examined her daughter and saw some injuries and fluid coming out of her private parts.






7.
PW3 was Lydia Mumbu, also known as Mama Vyonne. She stated that on the day of the incident, she had engaged the appellant to paint some assembled doors when he informed her that he had run out of paraffin. That she called PW1 who was playing outside her workshop and sent her to the petrol station to purchaser paraffin worth Kshs.100/=. That PW1 returned with half of the expected quantity and she decided to go back to the petrol station with her and the appellant to enquire why the paraffin was less.






8.
That as they were leaving, a customer walked in and she remained behind as the appellant went with PW1. That after a few minutes, PW1 ran back while crying and told her that the appellant had defiled her. That she resolved to go to the scene but the appellant had also returned to the workshop and he denied all the allegations made against him. That they went to the sub-chief’s office in the company of the appellant’s father and they also called PW2. That the appellant removed PW1’s panty and biker from his pocket and accompanied them to the scene where PW1’s shoes were found. The matter was reported at Gachoka Police Station.






9.
PW4 was Peter Kilunda Muli who stated that on the day of the incident, he received a phone call from PW3’s husband asking him to go to his workshop where he found the appellant and he was informed of the incident. That he took the appellant, PW1 and PW3 to the sub-chief’s office and while on the way, they met the appellant’s father. That the appellant admitted that he had committed the act and he blamed it on the devil. That the appellant led them to the scene and also produced PW1’s undergarments from his pocket. That the matter was reported at Gachoka Police Station.






10.
PW5, Dr. Godfrey Njuki Njiru of Embu Level 5 Hospital produced P3 and PRC forms on behalf of Dr. Phylis, his colleague, whose handwriting and signature he was familiar with. He stated that PW1 had a cut wound on her upper lip and had bruises on her vaginal and anal areas. The hymen was absent. The conclusion was that she had been physically and sexually assaulted.






11.
PW6 Christine Matindi, an analyst at the government chemist in Nairobi. She stated that her office received samples for analysis, being pubic hair, blood sample and oral swab from the appellant and Outer genital swab, anal swab and blood sample from the victim. She observed that there were no blood stains on the appellant’s pubic hair, the anal swab had no blood or sexual stains and the outer genital swab tested positive for semen. That the semen stains on the outer genital swab from the victim generated a mixed profile that matched the blood sample of the victim and male friction could not be resolved.






12.
PW7 was Inspector Teresia Waitherero Maina of Gachoka Police Station who stated that the incident was reported at the police station and the minor’s undergarments were found in the appellant’s trouser pocket. That she escorted the minor to the hospital for examination, treatment and age assessment since the minor did not have a birth certificate.






13.
At the close of the prosecution’s case, the trial court put the appellant to his defense. He gave an unsworn statement as DW1 stating that he did not defile the complainant.






14.
The trial court analysed the evidence adduced and found that the elements of the offence of defilement had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the appellant was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, being the sentence prescribed under section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






15.
In the appeal herein, the court directed the parties to file their written submissions but only the appellant complied.






16.
It was the appellant’s submission that the trial court convicted him without considering that the evidence adduced was not sufficient. He contended that the alleged incident couldn’t have happened since it was along an open road used by members of the public and in broad daylight. That the testimonies of PW1, PW2 and PW3 were coached to frame the appellant for an offence he did not commit. That the charge sheet was defective since he was presented in court 6 days after his arrest against the stipulated 24 hours yet the trial court did not consider that flaw under section 72(3)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






17.
That the time he was held in custody before being presented in court for plea-taking was sufficient for them to create the story and frame him for the incident. He referred to the inconclusive DNA analysis which showed that the foreign DNA from the semen stains could not be resolved. That PW2, PW3 and PW6 colluded to frame him for the offence to avoid paying him his money. That the trial court did not give its reasons for rejecting the appellant’s defense but simply stated that the appellant was on a fishing expedition.






18.
The issues for determination are as follows:
a.
Whether the charge sheet is defective;
b.
Whether the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt; and
c.
Whether the sentence meted out to the appellant is harsh and excessive.






19.
The appellant has argued that the charge sheet was defective in light of section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that he was held in police custody for a period of 6 days before being arraigned. Section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for circumstances when the charge and the evidence adduced are at variance or in cases when a charge sheet is amended, the accused person should take plea in light of the changes. Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code states:
“
Every charge or information shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains, a statement of the specific offence or offences with which the accused person is charged, together with such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to the nature of the offence charged.”






20.
From examining the charge sheet herein, the same is compliant with the provisions cited hereinabove since it correctly captures the details of the accused person and the specific offence and particulars thereof. The facts of the case were read out to the appellant and he took plea based on the information contained in the said charge sheet. In other words, the appellant did not fail to understand the charges brought against him on account of the charge sheet. In my view, the charge sheet was not defective. My position is guided by the case of MG v Republic (Criminal Appeal E051 of 2021) [2022] KEHC 14454 (KLR) where the court stated thus:
“
The Court of Appeal in Benard Ombuna v Republic (2019) eKLR addressed the issue of a defective charge sheet in the following terms:-
“In a nutshell, the test of whether a charge sheet is fatally defective is substantive rather than formalistic. Of relevance is whether a defect on the charge sheet prejudiced the appellant to the extent that he was not aware of or at least he was confused with respect to the nature of the charges preferred against him and as a result, he was not able to put up an appropriate defence.””






21.
Further,a charge sheet cannot be said to be defective, for the reason that the appellant was detained at the police station for a longer period than what is allowed in law, before he was arraigned in Court.






22.
As to whether the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt, section 8(1) and (2) of the 
sexual Offences Act
 provides the elements of the offence as follows:
a.
The age of the complainant- that the complainant was a child;
b.
Penetration as defined under section 2(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 happened to the child;
c.
The perpetrator was positively identified.






23.
The age assessment report dated 16
th
 November 2022 from Embu Level 5 Hospital shows that the complainant was 9 years old at the time. This is sufficient proof of the complainant’s age. The element of penetration was proved through the testimony of PW5 who stated that there were bruises on the vaginal and anal areas of the complainant and the hymen was absent. The conclusion was that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. PW6 also observed that there were semen stains on the outer genital swab of the complainant.






24.
On the identity of the assailant, the appellant decried the fact that the testimony of PW1 was not corroborated. When it comes to identification of an assailant in sexual offences, section 124 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 guides as follows:
“
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19 of the 
Oaths and Statutory Declarations Act
 (Cap. 15), where the evidence of the alleged victim is admitted in accordance with that section on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings against any person for an offence, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted on such evidence unless it is corroborated by other material evidence in support thereof implicating him:
Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.”






25.
This provision basically states that owing to the nature of sexual offences (which are often committed in the absence of witnesses besides the victim), the testimony of the victim on identification of the assailant does not need to be corroborated. PW1 narrated that the appellant is the one who defiled her after unsuccessfully trying to get her to use a shortcut. Besides, PW3 testified that the appellant went on the errand with the appellant since she remained behind to attend to a customer. In my view, this is sufficient evidence to identify the appellant as the assailant. The appellant led PW2 and PW3 to the scene and he was found in possession of the complainant’s biker and pants which were recovered from his own pockets. In his defence, he gave a very general denial and he did not give an explanation as to how the complainant’s biker and pant were found in his pockets.






26.
The appellant argues in this appeal that he was not properly identified given that DNA evidence identifying him was inconclusive. According to the government analyst’s report, the male fraction of the mixed profile generated from the semen stain on the outer genital swab of the victim could not be resolved. While this may have been true, it does not remove the appellant from the scene of crime nor does it change the evidence proving the 3 elements of the offence. I am not persuaded by the evidence of PW6 and hereby dismiss it. The evidence being wholesomely considered, it is my view that the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt.






27.
The final issue is whether the life imprisonment sentence meted out to the appellant is excessive in the circumstances. The sentence is prescribed under section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The supreme court in the case of 
Republic v Mwangi; Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 others (Amicus Curiae) (Petition E018 of 2023
) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR) stated that for as long as the sentences prescribed under section 8 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 remain undisturbed/constitutionally sound, the mandatory sentences ought to be applied as prescribed. It stated:
“
(66)
We must also reaffirm that, although sentencing is an exercise of judicial discretion, it is Parliament and not the Judiciary that sets the parameters of sentencing for each crime in statute. As such, striking down a sentence provided for in Statute, must be based not only on evidence and sound legal principles but on an in-depth consideration of public interest and the principles of public law that informed the making of that specific law. A judicial decision of that nature cannot be based on private opinions, sentiments, sympathy or benevolence. It ought not to be arbitrary, whimsical or capricious.”
Bearing this in mind, I find that the sentence imposed by the trial court is not to be disturbed by this court






28.
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal herein lacks merit and the same is hereby dismissed.






29.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
Grace Wangari Mwangi (hereafter the deceased) was killed and her body interred in a shallow grave. The spot was behind the cow-shed. The killer had disguised it well because the carcass of a cow had been buried there a few days earlier. The top was also covered with a heap of sand and some banana stems.






2.
The accused was employed as a farm hand or watchman and shared the compound with the deceased. He and a daughter-in-law, Monicah Muthoni, were the prime suspects. Monicah was however acquitted by the court on 9
th
 June 2022 for lack of evidence.






3.
The Information charged the accused with murder contrary to section 203 as read with section 204 of the Penal Code. The particulars are that on 20
th
 March 2017 at Karega Sub-Location, Kigumo Location, Kigumo Sub-County within Murang’a County, he and his former co-accused murdered the deceased.






4.
The prosecution called twelve witnesses. Mathew Waweru Mwangi (PW1) is a son of the deceased and lived a few matters from his mother’s house. On 20
th
 March 2017 at 18.30 hours, he found the deceased’s house locked. When he checked later at 20:00 hours, the lights were on.






5.
The following day, the house was still locked which heightened his suspicions. Calls to the deceased’s cell phone went unanswered. When he enquired from the accused, he said that the deceased left the previous day carrying a kiondo. Another watchman, Laibon, was away on leave. According to Nicholas Nyagah (PW2) the two guards used to live in some quarters near the cow sheds.






6.
Another witness, Nicholas Irungu Njuguna (PW5), a veterinary officer, went to the deceased’s house on 20
th
 March 2017 to collect his dues. There was no answer at the door. The accused told him that the deceased was not in.






7.
On 22
nd
 March 2017, PW1 went around the nearby Muthithi trading centre enquiring from some people whether they had seen the deceased. It was negative. He then got in touch with his brothers Felix Mwangi (PW4) and Bishop Muiru, but the two had also not heard from the deceased.






8.
They decided to break into the deceased’s house but found nothing of interest. PW1 locked up the house with a different padlock and made a report of a missing person at Kigumo Police Station. Searches in nearby mortuaries were negative.






9.
The police arrested the accused and recovered the deceased’s Nokia phone (exhibit 2) under a mattress in his house. PW1 was later summoned to Kigumo police station where he identified a Skylight decoder and remote (exhibit 3) and 2 gas cylinders (exhibits 4 & 5). He said he used to see the items in the deceased’s house.






10.
Exhibits 3, 4 and 5 were recovered from Elizabeth Nyambura (PW9), the accused’s girlfriend at Gakera. She testified that the accused gave her 2 mattresses; one was new and the other one old. In March 2017 he gave her a TV decoder, plastic seats and stools. The decoder was for GOTV but which they later switched to Skylife. He also gave her the remote controls.






11.
On 24
th
 March 2017, the accused called her and informed her that the decoder was required by Kigumo police. She took it there. The police later went to her house and collected the other items above. Under cross-examination, she clarified that the initial decoder was for GOTV but that the accused later bought the Skylife one.






12.
PW3 was Felista Wambui Irungu. She operated an Mpesa shop at Karega shopping centre. On 21
st
 March 2017, the accused, who was well known to her as a customer, withdrew Kshs 1050 from the deceased’s mobile wallet. The deceased would occasionally send him to withdraw money from her mobile line. She produced the Mpesa booklet number 45398 and sheet number A6809614 (exhibit 6).






13.
According to PW4 he was informed by PW1 on 25
th
 March 2017 that the deceased was missing. When he went to the scene on 26
th
 March 2017, he found many people and police officers. The remains of the deceased were exhumed from behind the cow shed in a shallow grave of about 3 feet. He said a cow had been buried there two weeks earlier and that the body was lying next to the cow. The body was removed to the Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi.






14.
PW6 was Corporal Peter Makau.On 22 March 2017, he received the report of a missing person from PW1. At about 9:00 pm, he informed CI Aden and IP Wainaina (PW8) that the accused had received Kshs 95 from the cell phone of deceased. PW6, IP Wainaina, Cpl Maina (PW7) and Cpl Wathiga went to home of deceased and arrested the accused.






15.
They interrogated him until midnight when he opened up and said he had killed the deceased and buried the remains within the compound. They took him back to his house the same night and recovered the deceased’s cell phone Nokia 1208 under a mattress. It had no Sim card. The accused had led them earlier to the cowshed area where the body was eventually found. There was a heap of sand and banana stems on top. PW6 guarded the scene until the next morning when he was relieved by some colleagues.






16.
On 24
th
 March 2017, he was given new leads by Cpl Maina (PW7). The two went back to accused's house and found the keys for deceased's house on the table (exhibit 8). They also recovered a jembe outside his house (exhibit 9). Leah Wanjiru Mwangi (PW11), a neighbour to the deceased, said the jembe belonged to her household.






17.
According to PW7,as they searched for the body in theshamba, the accused nudged him aside and disclosed that he had buried the deceased in the compound. PW7 informed IP Wainaina (PW8) and the accused repeated the same answer saying he feared for his life. He pinpointed the spot and implicated his co-accused claiming she was to pay him Kshs 10,000. They took him away and left PW6 to guard the scene. Under cross-examination, he conceded that what the accused said did not amount to a confession. But he said a formal confession was recorded later by Chief Inspector Festus Okoth. The latter however did not take to the stand.






18.
PW8’s evidence was largely along the lines of PW7 save to add that he recovered Kshs 3,850 from the accused’s pockets. The accused claimed he was paid the money by the co-accused. PW8 however doubted that version. The witness produced a Nokia Phone (exhibit 11) belonging to the accused and some two pieces of clothes: a petticoat (exhibit 13) and another one found around the deceased’s neck (exhibit 14).






19.
According to Lucy Muiru (PW10) she visited the deceased on 19
th
 March 2017 and gave her Kshs 3,000. Her other key evidence related to the strained relationship between the deceased and her daughter in law (co-accused) but who, as I stated earlier, was acquitted.






20.
The police obtained an order to exhume the remains. On 26
th
 March 2017, a postmortem examination was conducted by Dr. Oduor Johansen. The original report was produced with consent of the defence by PC Kosgey (PW12) under section 77 of the 
Evidence Act
. It concluded that the death resulted from “asphyxia due to ligature strangulation”.






21.
When the accused was placed on his defence, he protested his innocence. In his sworn evidence, he stated-
I learnt that the deceased’s body was found near the place where the cow was buried. I had visited that placef or 5 days. There was some digging around and some footsteps. My co-worker denied he had interfered with the place. I had no problem with salary. I had no sexual relationship with deceased. We had a normal relationship of worker/employer. I never showed the police where deceased was buried. I showed them where I suspected something near where the cow was buried. I had not told the police that deceased had gone to visit anywhere.






22.
When cross-examined, he said he had been employed by the deceased for over 10 years. He said he bought a mattress at a shop styled Nduka Njega but did not call the shopkeeper as a witness. He said that it was normal for deceased to send him to do Mpesa transactions and that he had her PIN. Regarding the scene, he said that a cow had been buried in the area but he suspected some activity was going on at the spot. He enquired from his co-worker, a herder known as Mubeya, but who denied it. The accused said that the gas cylinders referred to by witnesses were in Bishop Muiru’s house.






23.
Learned counsel for the accused filed final submissions dated 19
th
 April 2024 with two authorities annexed.






24.
I take the following view of the matter. Section 203 of the Penal Code provides that any person who of malice aforethought causes death of another person by an unlawful act or omission is guilty of murder.






25.
There are three key ingredients that must be present: first, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the death of the deceased and the cause of that death; secondly, that the accused committed the unlawful act that led to the death; and, thirdly, that the accused was of malice aforethought.






26.
There is no doubt about the death of the deceased. Doubt is completely erased by the post mortem report (Exhibit 7). In the opinion of the pathologist, the death resulted from “asphyxia due to ligature strangulation”.






27.
From that evidence, I find that the death was unlawful. The next question then is whether the Republic has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, of malice aforethought, killed the deceased.






28.
In the absence of an eye witness or an admissible confession, this case is entirely built atop circumstantial evidence. In order to convict on such evidence, the entire chain must be complete and point to the guilt of the accused “incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt”. R v Kipkering arap Koske & another 16 EACA 135 (1949).






29.
See also Sawe v Republic [2003] KLR 364, Mutua v Republic, High Court, Machakos, Criminal Appeal 198 of 2013 [2015] eKLR, Republic v Richard Itweka Wahiti, High Court, Kiambu, Criminal Case 9 of 2016 [2020] eKLR.






30.
It bears repeating that circumstantial evidence is good evidence. But the burden of proof that the accused murdered the deceased lay squarely with the Republic. Woolmington v DPP [1935] AC 462, Bhatt v Republic [1957] E.A. 332.






31.
It is not in dispute that the accused was employed as a guard or farmhand at the deceased’s homestead. He had worked as such for 10 years. He resided in the same compound with the deceased. His wages were however paid by one of the deceased’s sons, Bishop Muiru. So much so that his identification was never in doubt.






32.
The deceased went missing on 20
th
 March 2017. Efforts to trace her by her close family members proved futile. A report of a missing person was hence made to Kigumo Police Station on 22
nd
 March 2017.






33.
I find that there are a number of incriminating pieces of evidence that link up the accused to the murder. The first piece is that on the date when the deceased went missing on 20
th
 March 2017, the accused was living with her in the compound. The accused and another guard, Laibon, resided in some quarters near the cow sheds. But the evidence at the trial was clear that the other guard was away on leave during that period. The claim by the accused that it was another worker or Mubeya who had tampered with the place a cow had been buried is a red herring.






34.
Furthermore, on 21
st
 March 2017, the accused lied to PW1 that the deceased had left the previous day carrying a kiondo. He gave the same misleading information on 20
th
 March 2017 to the veterinary officer, Nicholas Irungu Njuguna (PW5), who had gone to the deceased’s house to collect his dues.






35.
The second incriminating piece of evidence is that on 21
st
 March 2017, he withdrew Kshs 1050 from the deceased’s mobile wallet. It is true that the deceased would occasionally send him to do such transactions and trusted him with her PIN credentials as confirmed by PW3. But by that date, the deceased was missing and buried in a shallow grave near the cowshed.






36.
Thirdly on 22
nd
 March 2017, the accused had received airtime worth Kshs 95 from the cell phone of deceased into his mobile phone. Like I stated, the deceased was long dead. Her cell phone was at all material times in the custody of the accused and was recovered hidden under a mattress in his quarters.






37.
The fourth important fragment of evidence is that after his arrest, and as the police and the public combed the shamba for the deceased’s remains, he pulled PW7 aside and pinpointed where he had buried the deceased. PW7 informed Inspector Wainaina (PW8) and the accused repeated the same story. He said he now feared for his life.






38.
It is at exactly that spot where the deceased’s body was exhumed the following day entombed in a shallow grave next to the carcass of a cow. The grave was a cleverly disguised: It was the spot of the buried cow; and, it was conveniently covered with a heap of sand and some banana stems.






39.
I must add that what the accused told PW7 and PW8 does not rise to the threshold of a confession. However, and according to PW8, the accused recorded a statement under caution and inquiry before Chief Inspector Festus Okoth but which was never produced. The latter never took to the stand.






40.
The fifth important piece of circumstantial evidence came from his girlfriend, Elizabeth Nyambura (PW9). In March 2017, the accused gave her several household items including a TV decoder, remote, two mattresses and two gas cylinders. According to PW8, the items were stolen from the deceased’s homestead.






41.
The totality of the circumstantial evidence is thus overwhelming. When I juxtapose it against the testimony of the accused, I readily find that the defence is a sham and completely evasive. The chain is complete and the accused is the only one who strangled the deceased and buried her remains behind the cowshed. He then tried to cover up the heinous crime while continuing to steal from her mobile wallet and spiriting away various household items to his girlfriend’s house in Karega.






42.
For all those reasons, I find that the conduct of the accused is inconsistent with his plea of innocence. From the set of circumstances that I have highlighted, the accused had malice aforethought as defined in section 206 of the Penal Code. The deceased died as a direct consequence of his conduct.






43.
The entire corpus of circumstantial evidence points irresistibly and exclusively to the guilt of the accused. I find no defence or hypothesis that exonerates him.






44.
The upshot is that the prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The accused, of malice aforethought caused the death of the deceased by an unlawful act. I accordingly enter a finding of guilty. The accused, Ezekiel Saitabu Nakola is hereby convicted.
It is so ordered.

          (Appeal from conviction and sentence by Hon. Mrs. Lucy Ambasi, Chief Magistrate, CM, in Busia CMCCRC No. E065 of 2021, of 29th December 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant, Francis Omanyala, had been charged before the primary court, of the offence of trafficking in a person, contrary to section 3(1) of the 
Counter-Trafficking in Persons Act
, Cap 61, Laws of Kenya. The particulars of the charge were that on 29
th
 December 2020, at Kongololo “A” in Teso North Sub-County, within Busia County, he transported Dennis Etyang, from Moding to Chemasir, by means of deception, for the purpose of exploiting the said Dennis Etyang. He denied the charges on 11
th
 January 2021, and a trial was conducted, where 4 witnesses testified.






2.
PW1, Alice Angela Oketeke, was the mother of the victim. She stated that the victim was mentally challenged. She was stated that the appellant was in a group of pastors who had visited the area, for the purpose of performing burial rites, and that the appellant thereafter took the victim with him. She said that she travelled to Chemasir, where she met the appellant, and he admitted he was with the victim, and that he had put him on a bicycle taxi to take him home, and although he had promised to show her the particular bicycle taxi used, he never did. PW2, Alice Wafula, was among the persons who were present at the funeral, and she said she saw the appellant take the victim, and left with him. PW3, Jared Etyang, was an uncle of the victim, and was at the funeral. He saw the appellant come to his house with the victim, and asked victim to kneel so that he could pray for him, after which he left with him. PW4, No. 747205 Police Corporal Alloyce Obuba, investigated the case.






3.
The appellant was put on his defence, vide a ruling that was delivered on 16
th
 November 2021. He made an unsworn statement, on 17
th
 November 2021. He denied the charges.






4.
In its judgment, delivered on 29
th
 December 2021, the trial court found the appellant guilty, on the basis that all the elements of the offence had been positively proved. He was sentenced, the same day, to a fine of Kshs. 30,000,000.00, or 30 years in prison in default.






5.
The appellant was aggrieved, and brought the instant appeal, arguing that the proceedings were shoddy; the mental status of the victim was not considered; his alibi defence was ignored; and the prosecution did not call all the necessary witnesses.






6.
Directions were given on 10
th
 November 2023, for canvassing of the appeal by way of written submissions. Both sides have filed written submissions, which I have read through, and taken note of the arguments made.






7.
The elements or ingredients of the offence charged were discussed in the following terms, in Muhammad Asif v Republic [2017] eKLR (Nyamweya, J):
“
The offence of trafficking in persons captures the entire trafficking continuum, and engagement in just one of these trafficking “stages” is sufficient. Therefore different persons or groups of people may be responsible for different aspects of the trafficking crime. The offence is thus formulated in such a way as to capture the different actors along the trafficking continuum, including those who do not directly exploit the victim’s labour or services, so long as they knew their action was for the purpose of exploiting or facilitating the exploitation of a person.”






8.
The elements of recruitment, transportation, transfering, harbouring or receiving of the victim, must be shown to be for the purpose of exploitation. In Muhammad Asif v Republic [2017] eKLR (Nyamweya, J), the court found that although there was proof of harbouring, there was no proof of exploitation. It was found and held as follows:
“
In the present appeal the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3, PW4 and PW6 was that the Appellant kept eight persons in a rented house, for which each person paid him ten dollars a day for accommodation and food. This evidence points to the act of harbouring persons which is one of the elements of the offence of trafficking in persons. However, there was no evidence adduced as to any other purpose for which the Appellant was harbouring the persons, and the witnesses PW1, PW2 and PW3 clearly indicated that the person who was to transport them to Brazil was one Kashif, and the purpose for which they were going to Brazil was also not shown. There is thus no evidence that demonstrates that the Appellant personally intended to exploit any victims, or that he knowingly facilitated exploitation by another person.”






9.
In Alibhai v Republic [2022] KEHC 15411 (KLR)(Ong’injo, J), the court found and held that there was recruitment and transportation, but there was no proof of exploitation. It was held:
“
From evidence provided the Appellant did recruit the 12 Nepalese ladies who connected with him directly or through a friend and facilitated their transportation to Kenya by paying their air fare. However, elements of exploitation as provided under section 2 of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Act No. 8 OF 2010 were not proved to the required standard as the 12 Nepalese girls were neither forced into labor; sexually exploited, forced into marriage; subjected to slavery or kept in a state of slavery or involuntary servitude or exploited in others ways as listed in the provision.”






10.
The other element of the offence is deception, so that the recruitment, transportation, transfering, harbouring or receiveing of the victim must be founded or based on deception. It was held in Alibhai v Republic [2022] KEHC 15411 (KLR)(Ong’injo, J), that :
“


124.
I also find that the Nepalese ladies were not deceived. According to “https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/deception’’ deception is defined as “knowingly deceiving another or causing another to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, by preventing another from acquiring information, or by any other conduct, act, or omission that creates, confirms, or perpetuates a false impression in another, including a false impression as to law, value, state of mind, or other objective or subjective fact.""






125.
From the evidence on record there is no indication that the 12 Nepalese ladies were deceived into coming to Kenya. They all knew the kind of work they would be engaging in and upon arrival that is the exact nature of work they engaged in. The element of exploitation alluded to by the trial Court at paragraph 102 of the judgment to the effect that the Appellant used means of deception by sending one month’s salary in advance to facilitate travels and taking advantage of financial vulnerability for purposes of exploitation is not in evidence and the Appellant was not charged with the offence under section 3(1)(e).The Prosecution failed to prove the element of deception to the required standard.”








11.
Where the relevant elements or the ingredients of the offence are not proved, then the charge cannot hold. In Benard Onyandi v Republic [2018] eKLR (Riechi, J), the court said:
“
The above ingredients of the offence were not covered in the facts tendered before the trial court. The facts only lead to the fact that appellant asked the complainant to accompany him to his home on pretext that he will take her to Nairobi to work as a house-help. No evidence adduced as to who was the potential employer, the transportation from her home or the nature of exploitation the appellant was going to subject the complainant to. This is crucial to sustain a charge of trafficking. Perusing the facts, I am not satisfied that they contain all the ingredients of the offence for appellant to be convicted. There being insufficient evidence to support the charge, I am inclined and do find that the facts are narrated by the prosecutor did not support the charge of trafficking in person, the offence appellant was charged with.”






12.
The charge herein alleged transportation of the victim, through deception, for the purpose of exploitation. From the material presented there is little evidence that the appellant ever transported the victim. They were allegedly seen together at Moding. The allegation was that they travelled to Chemasir, however, PW1, who alleged to have had travelled to Chemasir did not see the appellant and the victim together there. It cannot, therefore, be said that the appellant had transported the victim to Chemasir, for none of the witnesses saw them travel together to Chemasir, neither did they talk of seeing the 2 together there. On deception, no evidence was led showing that the appellant deceived the victim in anyway. No evidence was adduced on the form or nature of the deception deployed by the appellant. No one testified to having been privy to any communication or conversation between the appellant and the victim, from which it could be deduced that there was deception. On the exploitation, no evidence was led that the appellant personally exploited the victim in anyway, nor that he facilitated any form of exploitation of the victim by others. No evidence was led as to where the victim ended up, and what he was doing at the destination, to warrant a conclusion that he was under exploitation, and that he had been transported to that destination for that purpose. So, overall, the offence of trafficking in a person was not established, and the appellant ought not have been convicted.






13.
In view of the above, it is my finding and holding that the appeal herein has merit. I allow it, with the consequence that the conviction of the appellant is hereby quashed. The sentence imposed on him is hereby set aside. He shall be set free, from prison custody, unless he is otherwise lawfully held. It is so ordered.

Brief facts


1.
This application dated 12
th
 February 2024 seeking for the orders of an injunction to restrain the respondent, by himself or his representatives from selling, entering, leasing, encroaching and/or trespassing, interfering, wasting, constructing or dealing in any manner, with Plot No. xxx Ngei II Kugeria or any developments thereon pending the hearing and determination of the originating summons dated 12
th
 February 2024.






2.
In opposition to the application, the respondent filed a Replying Affidavit dated 25
th
 April 2024.








The Applicant’s case


3.
The applicant states that she was married to the respondent through cohabitation in 1989 and their marriage is blessed with two issues. The applicant states that she is a business lady and sells cereals at Nyamakima since 2004. The applicant further states that the respondent is an engineer and a contractor who has vast properties and cars.






4.
The applicant states that she parted ways with the respondent due to his cruelty and desertion. During their separation, the respondent procured a monogamous marriage and put up a matrimonial home in Ngariama Kirinyaga County where he currently lives.






5.
The applicant states that they reconciled in the year 2010 and they continued cohabiting. During their cohabitation, the respondent’s business went under and he could not cater of the family’s needs which included providing shelter for the family. Thus, the applicant states that she purchased the suit property so as to deal with the shelter menace. Without any assistance from the respondent, the applicant states that she requested her sister LWK for Kshs. 300,000/- to purchase the property.






6.
On 26
th
 March 2013, the applicant entered into an agreement for the sale of Plot No. xxx in Ngei II Kugeria from one Salome Wanjiku Babu who is well known to her. The applicant states that she paid Kshs. 500,000/- as part of the purchase price and paid the balance in instalments thereby transferring ownership to her name. She was then issued with the share certificate no. xxx of Ngei II Kugeria. The applicant states that she paid the entire purchase price in cash as she was close friends with the vendor.






7.
The applicant then requested her son, an architect to prepare and follow up with the building plans of their home. The applicant further sought for referrals of a qualified contractor who began construction of the house and she states that the respondent chased her away when the house was at the roofing stage.






8.
The applicant avers that during construction she paid all the contractors and bought all the building materials and the respondent started coming to see if the site was stalling or continuing having already chased away the contractor and her son who was supervising the project.






9.
The applicant states that upon completion of the house, she invited the respondent to join her and her sons in the new home. After a short period of time, the respondent chased away their sons from her house claiming that they were not his children. The applicant states that she rented a house for the children for they had no alternative shelter. The applicant further states that their sons have never lived in peace or harmony due to the turmoil caused by the respondent in the family.






10.
The applicant states that from the onset of their cohabitation, through the years and most recent in 2022, the respondent vowed to kill her and burned the bedroom door where she had locked herself for her safety. Due to the immense violence and cruelty meted upon her by the respondent, the applicant states that she ran away from the house for her safety. The applicant further states that she filed for divorce and the marriage was annulled.






11.
Due to the fear inflicted by the respondent, the applicant states that she sought police assistance to collect her personal and household items in November 2023 but the respondent had stolen, hid and destroyed the receipts she used to purchase the building materials. The applicant avers that she has been staying with family and friends despite her having a property registered in her name.






12.
The applicant argues that the ordeal has caused her financial loss and mental distress and she will be greatly tormented if the house is sold as she and the children will have no place to call home. The applicant states that the suit property does not form part of matrimonial property and prays that the court declare the suit property to have been solely purchased by herself. The applicant states that the respondent will not suffer irreparable harm or damage as he has his matrimonial home where he causally resides together with his second wife.








The Respondent’s Case


13.
The respondent states that he met the applicant in 1989 and started living together from February 1990 in Bahati Estate. During their cohabitation, the respondent states that they were blessed with two issues born on 1
st
 January 1990 and 4
th
 July 1993.






14.
The respondent states that he was employed at Kenya Threads Industry as a sales manager while the applicant was unemployed when they met. The respondent states that he left employment at Kenya Threads Industry in 1991 and the applicant left their rented home without any reasonable cause. The respondent avers that the applicant has been in and out of their matrimonial home and he has never harassed or been cruel to her.






15.
The respondent states that he met another lady MN in August 2004 whom he married. This was after the continued desertion of more than 10 years by the applicant and further because his efforts if reconciliation with the applicant had failed.






16.
The respondent states that his only known matrimonial home is situated on Plot No. xxx Ngei II Kugeria and the applicant had failed to provide any substantial proof of her baseless assumptions and averments.






17.
In 2009, the respondent states that after extensive consultations between his family and that of the applicant’s they settled their differences and moved back in with the applicant in Kerugoya then to Kahawa Wendani then to Safari Park Gardens where he rented the said houses. The respondent states that the applicant caused separation with his other wife when she assaulted his second wife causing her to flee for her own safety. The respondent states that the applicant is naturally prone to anger and violence is her inherent attribute.






18.
The respondent states that his friend Njagi Njiru was facing financial issues and wished to sell his property at Kshs. 450,000/-. The respondent avers since he had Kshs. 420,000/-, he borrowed the balance of Kshs. 30,000/- from the applicant and bought it and returned back her money together with an additional Kshs. 20,000/- as a token of appreciation.






19.
The respondent avers that the applicant approached him and told him that she had spotted some land in Ruiru, Membley Estate which she was interested in buying to build their matrimonial home. He further states that the purchase price was Kshs. 950,000/- and the applicant had managed to borrow Kshs. 600,000/- and thus he topped up the balance of Kshs. 350,000/-. The share certificate was printed in her name since it was their family home.






20.
The respondent avers that he began constructing their permanent house in June 2014 and his company vehicles would transport the construction materials which he purchased. Further, the respondent states that since he was a contractor, he would have his professional staff on the ground to supervise the ongoing construction.






21.
The respondent avers that the applicant only contributed a sum of Kshs. 575,000/- for the entire construction of the matrimonial house which costed Kshs. 4,800,000/- without considering the cost of the land. Further, the remainder sum of Kshs. 4,250,000/- was his contribution towards the construction of the matrimonial home which amount is well accounted for. the respondent states that he moved into the house in September 2016 with the applicant by which time their children had all moved out. The respondent further avers that he completed construction of the suit home in August 2017. He further states that he built the water storage tanks, paid for water infrastructure fee for pie works that had been done and contributed towards the connection of water supply to the matrimonial home.






22.
The respondent avers that he provided for all his needs for his children at al times and never belittled them. The respondent states that the applicant is the one who has been meting violence upon him and abusing him verbally which he reported at BTL Police Post in September 2019 under OB x/19/09/2019.






23.
The respondent states that the applicant left on her own volition after assaulting him and he noticed that none of her essential documents and personal valuables were in the house meaning that she had partly moved. Further, the respondent states that the applicant is attempting to evict him from their matrimonial home. The respondent states that he will be greatly prejudiced and at the risk of being left homeless and destitute if the orders sought are granted as he cannot afford rent because he is economically unstable currently. He further states that he uses the suit property as his office and his business and employees stand to suffer.






24.
The applicant filed a Supplementary affidavit dated 20
th
 June 2024 and states that when she met the respondent he was unemployed. Further the applicant states that from the year 1994 – 2004, she did different jobs to sustain her children and eventually ventured into the cereal business. The applicant states that she has left the respondent on numerous occasions because of his cruelty, harassment, abusive language, belittling and his male chauvinist attitude.






25.
The applicant avers that the respondent did not provide basic needs for his children who stayed with her mother back in Othaya for over 15 years. Further, the respondent remarried in 1998 and in 2004 they solemnized their marriage through a church wedding at PCEA Church. The applicant further avers that the respondent established a matrimonial home on LR No. Ngariama/kabare/xxx (Kiambatha Farm) where he forced her to stay together with his wife but there arose a conflict which forced her to embark on purchasing the suit property to avoid any further grievances with the respondent’s wife.






26.
The applicant states that the respondent denied paternity of her last born son and only wanted to cater for one child. During their stay in Kerugoya, the applicant states that they used to live in between the rental house and the respondent’s matrimonial home where her first born son was given a gazebo while the 2
nd
 family occupied the matrimonial house. The applicant avers that she was the one who used to pay the house rent as the respondent used to threaten that he could leave her any time.






27.
The applicant avers that after the commotion with the respondent’s wife, the respondent approached her and told her that they should buy land in Baragwe/Kianguku which is near his ancestral home. The applicant further avers that the respondent is used to selling family assets with no consent and does not like to be questioned on the same. Further, the applicant states that the respondent is the registered owner of land in South Ngariama, Baragwi/Kariru, Nrariama/Baragwi, land in Lamu, Juja Farm and Kamiti/Animar and the only reason he is not the registered owner of the suit property is because it does not belong to him.






28.
The applicant avers she and her sons have no place to call home and further that she has been informed that the respondent sold the land he bequeathed them at Ngariama/Baragwi. The applicant further avers that the respondent continues to live at both houses in Ruiru and at Kiambathi Farm while she continues to incur losses, anguish and pay rent.






29.
The respondent filed a Further Affidavit on 17
th
 July 2024 and reiterated the contents of his Replying Affidavit and states that he always contributed to the upkeep of the children and would occasionally send money to the applicant’s mother through friends for the upkeep of the children. Further the applicant used to collect money for upkeep in his office.






30.
The respondent avers that the applicant has always been in the habit of running away from the matrimonial home without any cause as she deserted her matrimonial home in 1994 and returned in 2009, in 2015 and returned after three months and on 2019 and returned in February 2020.






31.
The respondent states that he never denied the paternity of his youngest child but he was concerned about how the pregnancy came about considering that the applicant had deserted their home.






32.
The respondent denies ownership of the properties listed by the applicant in her supplementary affidavit save for the Ngariama/Barigwi (Kiambatha farm) which has recently been disposed of by way of public auction.






33.
The respondent states that in 2022, the applicant was arrested and arraigned in court to answer charges of assault in Ruiru MCCR/E1235/2022, reported and recorded under OB No. xx/27/05/2022 which he withdrew in November 2023 after the dissolution of marriage was allowed in June 2023. The respondent states that all the allegations of cruelty, assault and violence claimed by the applicant are untrue and without any substantial proof.






34.
Parties disposed of the application by way of written submissions.








The Applicant’s Submissions


35.
The applicant submits that the suit property is not matrimonial property pursuant to Section 2, 6 and 7 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
. The applicant submits that she filed the instant application owing to an indication from the respondent that he wants to sell the suit property to third parties. The respondent further denied her access to the property despite her being the legal and registered owner of the suit property. The applicant sought injunctive orders so that the status of the property remains the same.






36.
The applicant relies on Section 68(1) of the Lands Registration Act and the case of Mwambeja Ranching Co. Limited & Another vs Kenya National Capital Corporation Limited & 6 Others (2015) eKLR and submits that she has met the threshold for the grant of injunctive orders. she further submits that she has shown that she has a prima facie case by showing that she was not married to the respondent as he married his wife in 2004 under Christian marriage. The applicant further states that the balance of convenience tilts towards preserving the suit property as failing to do the same will render the matter nugatory.






37.
The applicant submits that she is the legal and registered owner of the suit property, a fact not denied by the respondent as he does not hold any title document to show proof of ownership. The applicant further submits that the respondent continues to enjoy possession of the property solely to her exclusion and that of the children who are renting houses. Thus, the applicant states that pending the determination of the suit, she should be granted vacant possession of the property as the legal and registered owner.








The Respondent’s Submissions


38.
The respondent reiterates what he deponed in his affidavits and submits that he contributed a sizeable amount towards the establishment of the matrimonial home. According to the respondent, he commenced construction of the matrimonial home in 2014 and through his resources, machinery and expertise, he ensured that their home was complete and they moved in together with the applicant in the year 2016. The respondent further submits that the estimated cost of construction was Kshs. 4,800,000/- and the applicant only contributed Kshs. 575,000/-.






39.
The respondent relies on Section 2 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 and the cases of T.K.M vs S.M.W [2020] eKLR and N.W.M vs K.N.M (2014) eKLR and submits that he has made both monetary and non-monetary contributions which fact is corroborated by the evidence filed and annexed to his replying affidavit and further from the supervisory role he played all through the construction and establishment of the matrimonial home.






40.
The respondent relies on Section 7 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 and submits that even though his name does not appear on the register in terms of ownership of the suit property, he argues that he still has a beneficial interest over the property owing to the substantial contribution he has made towards its establishment. The respondent further submits that he contributed towards the purchase of Plot No. xxx Ngei II Kugeria even though his name is not in the register.






41.
The respondent cites Article 45 of 
the Constitution
 and the case of P.N.N. vs Z.W.N [2017] eKLR and submits that although the provision grants equal rights to parties to a marriage it does not mean that a party to a marriage is entitled to equal share of the property acquired during marriage unless his or her contribution is ascertained to have been equal to that of the other spouse.






42.
The respondent submits that the reliefs sought by the applicant cannot suffice as he has a beneficial interest over the subject matrimonial property.








The Law


Whether the applicant has met the requisite conditions to warrant the granting of a temporary injunction.


43.
The principles of interlocutory injunction are now well settled. Those principles were set out in East African Industries vs Trufoods [1972]EA 420 and Giella vs Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd [1973]EA 358. Restating the said principles, Ringera J, (as he then was) in 
Airland Tours & Travel Limited vs National Industrial Credit Bank Nairobi (Milimani) HCCC No. 1234 of 2002
 set them out as follows:-
a.
A prima facie case with a probability of success at trial;
b.
The applicant is likely to suffer an injury, which cannot be adequately compensated in damages;
c.
If the court is in doubt about the existence or otherwise of a prima facie case it should decide the application on a balance of convenience;
d.
The conduct of the applicant meets the approval of the court of equity.






44.
Similarly, in Dr. Simon Waiharo Chege vs Paramount Bank of Kenya Ltd Nairobi (Milimani) HCCC No. 360 of 2001, Ringera J, (as he then was) held:-
“
The remedy of injunction is one of the greatest equitable relief. It will issue in appropriate cases to protect the legal and equitable rights of a party to litigation, which have been, or are being or are likely to be violated by the adversary. To benefit from the remedy, at an interlocutory stage, the applicant must, in the first instance show that he has a prima facie case with a probability of success at the trial. If the court is in doubt as to the existence of such a case, it should decide the application on a balance of convenience. And because of its origin and foundation in the equity stream of the jurisdiction of the courts of judicature, the applicant is normally required to show that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the injury suffered or likely to be suffered if he is to obtain an interlocutory injunction. As the relief is equitable in origin, it is discretionary in application and will not issue to a party whose conduct as pertains to the subject matter of the suit does not meet the approval of the eye of equity.”








A prima facie case with a probability of success at trial


45.
What then constitutes a prima facie case? In the case of Mrao Ltd vs First American Bank of Kenya Ltd & 2 Others [2003] KLR 125,
“
The principles which guide the court in deciding whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction are, first, an applicant must show prima facie case with a probability of success. Secondly, an interlocutory injunction will not normally be granted unless an applicant might otherwise suffer irreparable injury, which would not adequately be compensated by an award of damages. Thirdly, if the court is in doubt, it will decide an application on the balance of convenience….A mere scintilla of evidence can never be enough; nor can any amount of worthless discredited evidence. It is true that the court is not required at that stage to decide finally whether the evidence is worthy of credit, or whether if believed it is weighty enough to prove the case conclusively: that final determination can only properly be made when the case for the defence has been heard. It may not be easy to define what is meant by “prima facie case” but at least it must mean one on which a reasonable tribunal, properly directing its mind to the law and the evidence could convict if no explanation is offered by the defence…The terms “prima facie” case, and “genuine and arguable” case do not necessarily mean the same thing, for in using another term, namely a suitable cause of action, the words “prima facie” are frequently used to refer to a case which shifts the evidential burden of proof, rather than as giving rise to a legal burden of proof in the manner of considering, which was in relation to the pleadings that had been put forward in the case. It would be in the appellant’s interest to adopt a genuine and arguable case standard rather than one of prima facie case, the former being the lesser standard of the two…In civil cases a prima facie case is a case in which on the material presented to the court a tribunal properly directing itself will conclude that there exists a right which has apparently being infringed by the opposite party to call for an explanation or rebuttal from the latter. A prima facie case is more than an arguable case. It is not sufficient to raise issues but the evidence must show an infringement of a right, and the probability of success of the applicant’s case upon trial. That is clearly, a standard, which is higher than an arguable case.”






46.
It is not in dispute that the applicant and the respondent were married in 1989 through cohabitation. The applicant filed for a divorce vide Ruiru SPMC Divorce Cause No. E063 of 2023 where a decree nisi was issued on 6
th
 June 2023 and certificate of making a decree nisi absolute was issued on 6
th
 December 2023. Both parties agree that during their marriage they acquired the suit property Plot No. xxx Ngei II Kugeria however the applicant argues that she solely acquired the said property through a loan from her sister whereas the respondent argues that both he and the applicant acquired the suit property but he made the bigger contribution. The applicant has annexed a sale agreement between her and the vendor one Salome Wanjiku Babu and a share certificate showing that she is the registered proprietor of the suit property. The respondent on the other hand claims that they agreed that the applicant’s name appear solely on the share certificate but he contributed to the purchase of the land and the building of their matrimonial home.






47.
Section 6 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 2013, defines matrimonial property to include the matrimonial home or homes, any household goods in the home or homes or any other property jointly owned and acquired during the subsistence of the marriage.






48.
At this juncture it is evident that as the parties were married and lived as a couple they both contributed to their marriage in their own respective ways. During the pendency of the marriage both parties acquired certain rights which this court must protect pending the hearing and determination of their divorce and the distribution of the property they may have acquired upon proof of individual contribution towards its acquisition. The applicant has sought for injunctive orders based on the fact that she acquired the suit property solely and the suit land is registered in her name but the respondent has threatened to sell the matrimonial home thus leaving her and the children destitute and homeless.






49.
From the record it is evident that the issue of contribution cannot be determined at this interlocutory stage and would need to be ventilated at trial. Although the applicant has argued that the suit property belongs to her solely and that the respondent did not contribute to it, it is evident that the said property was acquired during the subsistence of the marriage and both parties would need to ventilate their respective cases. It is therefore my considered opinion that the applicant has established a prima facie case.
Irreparable Injury
Paul Gitonga Wanjau vs Gathuthi Tea Factory Company Ltd & 2 Others [2016]eKLR the court considered Halsbury’s Laws of England on what irreparable loss is and stated that:-
“
First, that the injury is irreparable and second, that it is continuous. By the term irreparable injury is meant injury which is substantial and could never be adequately remedied or atoned for by damages, not injury which cannot possibly be repaired and the fact that the plaintiff may have a right to recover damages is no objection to the exercise of the jurisdiction by injunction, if his rights cannot be adequately protected or vindicated by damages.”






50.
The question is whether the applicant demonstrated that she will suffer irreparable loss unless the injunction is granted, which loss would not adequately be compensated by an award of damages? The applicant submits that she is apprehensive as she was evicted from the suit property and the respondent has already done a valuation and is in the process of selling it to her exclusion as she is the registered owner.






51.
The respondent is silent on the issue of selling the house but he maintains that the applicant left their matrimonial home on her own volition and if the court grants the orders sought by the applicant he risks being homeless and destitute.






52.
Notably, the suit property is registered in the name of the applicant. However she states that she left the matrimonial home without any documents and as such the title document is not in her possession. As such, there is a great probability that the respondent may dispose of the property without the consent or knowledge of the applicant. It cannot b e ruled out that the respondent may render the applicant and her children homeless if injunctive orders are not granted. I am therefore satisfied that the applicant may suffer irreparable injury which would not be adequately compensated by way of damages.








Balance of Convenience Test


53.
In the case of Pius Kipchirchir Kogo vs Frank Kimeli Tenai [2018] eKLR, the court in dealing with the issue on balance of convenience held as follows:-
The meaning of balance of convenience in favour of the plaintiff is that if the injunction is not granted and the suit is ultimately decided in favour of the plaintiffs, the inconvenience to the plaintiff would be greater than that which would be caused to the defendants if an injunction is granted but the suit is ultimately dismissed. Although it is called balance of convenience it is really the balance of inconvenience and it is for the plaintiffs to show that the inconvenience caused to them would be greater than that which may be caused to the defendants. Should the inconvenience be equal, it is the plaintiffs who suffer? In other words, the plaintiffs have to show that the comparative mischief from the inconvenience which is likely to arise from withholding the inunction will be greater than which is likely to arise from granting it.






54.
In light of the above, it is my considered opinion that the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the applicant because the inconvenience caused to her will be much greater than that caused to the respondent if the injunction is not granted.










Conclusion


55.
I am of the considered view that the applicant has met the threshold as set out in the case of Giella vs Cassman Brown and therefore an injunction ought to issue in her favour. I find that the application dated 12
th
 February 2024 has merit and is hereby allowed. In the following terms:-
a.
That the respondent is hereby restrained from selling, leasing, encroaching, occupying, interfering, dealing in any other way with Plot No. xxx Ngei III Kugeria pending determination of this cause.
b.
The costs of this application shall be in the cause.






56.
It is hereby so ordered.

The child (male) was born on 19 August 2019 to EWK. Details of the father are not provided. The child, almost 5 years old, has lived with the grandmother, C.K.K. since birth. The child is a nephew to the Applicant; his biological mother and the Applicant are cousins.






4.
The child was declared free for adoption on 6 October 2023 by the Change Trust, a registered Adoption Agency, vide the annexed Certificate serial number 00621. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met.








The Applicant


5.
The Applicant is Kenyan citizen, aged 42 years. She resides in Nairobi and is currently employed in the communications industry. The Applicant is single, with no children of her own. She confirmed that she has been providing and caring for the child since he was born, and has been a guardian to the child’s biological mother as well.






6.
The Applicant confirmed that she fully understands the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.






7.
The Applicant proposed CKK to be the legal guardian of the child. CKK is grandmother to the child and has been living with him since birth. She confirmed that she fully understands the implications of the order and had willingly consented to the appointment.








The Biological Mother


8.
The biological mother, E.W.K, is 27 years old. Although there is no consent for adoption provided in the documents, there is an Explanatory Memorandum for Biological Parent/Guardian provided by Change Trust which has been signed by E.W.K. Similarly, the biological mother has signed the Form of Certificate of Acknowledgement dated 3 March 2023. The biological mother appeared in court and confirmed that she had given consent to the adoption of her child by the Applicant herein. She further confirmed that she fully understood the implication of the adoption order.








The Adoption Application


9.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed in a bid to determine whether the Applicant is a suitable adoptive parent.






10.
Change Trust conducted an assessment of the Applicant. Although the child was not interviewed, bonding between the child and Applicant was observed. At the hearing, the child identified the Applicant and appeared to be comfortable with her. The Agency filed its report dated 6 October 2023 declaring the child free for adoption and recommending the adoption.






11.
On 8 March 2024, the Court issued an order appointing Hellen Nduta Kimani as the child’s Guardian ad Litem, and further directing the Guardian ad Litem and Director of Children’s Services to investigate the suitability and fitness of the Applicant and subsequently file their respective reports.






12.
The Guardian ad Litem filed her report dated 4th June 2024, recommending the kinship adoption. The Directorate of Children’s Services, Nairobi County filed its report dated 9th July 2024, recommending the adoption of the child by the Applicant herein.






13.
Section 193(1) of the 
Children Act
 provides that kinship adoption order may only be made in favor of a relative of the child. In this instance, the Applicant is the maternal aunt of the child.






14.
In view of the foregoing, the court is satisfied that:
i.
The proposed adoption is a kinship adoption, meaning that the child will continue to be within the family.
ii.
The adoption will be in the best interest of the child; and
iii.
The Applicant has been approved as a prospective adoptive parent by competent social workers through a duly registered Adoption Society under the Department of Children Services, thus she is able to effectively handle her parental responsibilities.






15.
Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicant, E.W.W, is allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby C.M;
ii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iii.
C.K.K is appointed as legal Guardian of the child,
iv.
The Guardian ad Litem is hereby discharged;
v.
That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;

Respondent










Judgment










1.
A brief outline of the case was that the Applicant was charged with the offence of Defilement Contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The particulars of the offence are that on diverse dates between 27
th
 August, 2011 and September, 2011 at (Particulars withheld) Village in Kiambu County the Applicant unlawfully and intentionally committed an act which caused penetration with his genital organ (penis) into the genital organ (vagina) of BWM a child aged seven (7) years. The alternative charge was committing an Indecent Act with a child aged seven (7) years c/s to Section 11(1) of the same Act. The particulars are the same save for the fact that there was touching as opposed to penetration.






2.
The Applicant was convicted and was sentenced accordingly for Defilement; the provisions of Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 imposes a mandatory life sentence for the offence.






3.
The Applicant having exhausted all the channels of appeal has now moved this court by way of an application for revision as opposed to a Petition for resentencing under the guidelines made by the Court of Appeal in the Mombasa Petiti
on No.97 of 2021
Manyeso vs Republic case; in this instant application the applicant is seeking the following prayers;
i.
An order for revision of the life sentence imposed on the grounds that it is indeterminate and inhumane.
ii.
An order for revision of the sentence to commence from the date of arrest.






4.
At the hearing hereof the Applicant was unrepresented and relied on his affidavit; whereas the Respondent was represented by Prosecuting Counsel Mr. Gacharia ; hereunder are the parties short submissions.






Applicant’s Case


5.
The Applicant prayed to be granted a definite and lenient sentence; and also prayed that the period spent in remand be taken into consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code;






6.
He had been arrested on 5/10/2011 and sentenced on 29/08/2012 which is a period of eleven (11) months spent in custody from the time of his arrest;








Respondent’ S Case


7.
The State was not opposed to the application but requested that the Kiambu lower court record and a Victim Impact Report be availed to assist this court in making its decision in determining the appropriate sentence to be considered.








Issues For Determination


8.
After hearing the submissions this court has framed the following issues for determination is as follows;
i.
Whether the Applicant is deserving of a resentencing of his sentence.
ii.
Whether the Applicant was deserving of the benefits of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.








Analysis


Whether the Applicant is deserving of a resentencing of his sentence


9.
The Court of Appeal in the Manyeso (supra) case declared the mandatory life sentence to be unconstitutional and persons so convicted were at liberty and entitled to petition the High Court for re-sentencing under the provisions of Article 50(2)(p) and (q) of 
the Constitution
 2010; in line with the decision this court has the mandate to grant alternate sentences after taking into consideration various mitigating factors;






10.
This court in order to render substantive justice will overlook the fact that the applicant has filed an application for revision as opposed to a Petition and will invoke the provisions of Article 159(2) of 
the Constitution
 to ensure that the administration of justice is done without undue regard to procedural technicalities.






11.
It is this court’s view that when considering to review the sentence it must take into consideration the following factors; firstly, the gravity of the offence and its prevalence; secondly, the facts and circumstances of the case and whether the applicant is repentant and genuinely remorseful for the unlawful act.






12.
This court has carefully considered the facts of the case, the gravity of the offence, gravity and prevalence of such offences, also the fact that the applicant executed the offence repetitively on an innocent child aged seven (7) years, and the scars the incidents left on the victim.






13.
Indeed, the applicant realizes the gravity of the offence he committed and he is sorry and has demonstrated genuine remorse for what he did; the aggravating circumstances are found to far outweigh the applicants’ mitigating factors; this court is of the considered view that although the review of life sentence is merited on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of the sentence, there is a need to still impose a custodial sentence that will also act as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to commit similar offences.






14.
This court is satisfied that in line with the Manyeso (supra) case the applicant is deserving of a reduction of the unconstitutional life sentence imposed; which sentence is substituted with a custodial sentence of thirty (30) years.
Whether the Applicant was deserving of the benefits of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






15.
The Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guidelines (2014) provides guidance on this issue as follows:
“
The proviso to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to take into account the time already served in custody if the convicted person had been in custody during the trial. Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed. In determining the period of imprisonment that should be served by an offender, the court must take into account the period in which the offender was held in custody during the trial.”






16.
Since the sentence imposed was a mandatory life sentence none of the courts from the trial court to the appellate courts had reason to address this issue so this court is obligated to address it.






17.
The court record establishes that the Applicant had been arrested on 5/10/2011 and sentenced on 29/08/2012 which translates to a period of eleven (11) months spent in custody from the date of his arrest.






18.
Taking into consideration these facts and the sentencing guiding principles outlined above, this court is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to the benefits of Sec 333(2) of the Criminal procedure Code.






19.
The Applicant shall serve 30 years imprisonment less the period spent in custody of eleven (11) months.










Findings And Determination


20.
For the forgoing reasons this court finds that the application for re-sentencing is meritorious; and finds the most appropriate sentence for the offence committed to be a custodial term of thirty (30) years;






21.
This court finds that the applicant is entitled to the benefit of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






22.
The eleven (11) months spent in remand be deducted from the sentence imposed of thirty (30) years.




Orders accordingly.

Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma, (Sitati, J.) dated 14th May, 2019inHCCRA No. 82 of 2018)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Pius Wafula, the appellant herein, was tried before the Senior Resident Magistrate’s Court at Sirisia for the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. It was alleged that he had defiled one, H.B., a 14-year- old child, who is his cousin.






2.
Upon hearing the evidence of five prosecution witnesses and the appellant’s sworn defence, the trial magistrate found the offence of defilement not proved, but using Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Code convicted the appellant with attempted defilement contrary to Section 9(1) as read with Section 9(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, and sentenced him to a term of 15 years’ imprisonment.






3.
The appellant appealed to the High Court against his conviction and sentence, but the learned Judge of the High Court (Sitati, J) having heard the appeal, dismissed it.






4.
The appellant is now before us in a second appeal in which he has appealed against sentence only. He has filed a memorandum of appeal raising seven grounds which, in effect, are mitigating circumstances upon which he urges the Court to reduce his sentence of 15 years imprisonment to a more lenient term.






5.
The respondent has filed written submissions through Robert Oyiembo, an Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, in which it opposed any reduction of the appellant’s sentence, arguing that the appellant escaped conviction on the main charge merely on account of a technicality. The respondent argued that the circumstance of the offence calls for a severe and deterrent sentence, and the sentence of 15 years imposed on the appellant should, therefore, be confirmed.






6.
We have carefully considered this appeal, the submissions and the law. Under Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the jurisdiction of this Court on a second appeal is limited to matters of law only, and severity of sentence is identified as a matter of fact. This means that this Court can only deal with an appeal against sentence where it raises an issue that goes beyond severity.






7.
The appellant has restricted his appeal to the issue of sentence only. In effect, he is urging us to reduce the sentence due to his current mitigating circumstances. From the evidence that was adduced in the trial court, the child testified that the appellant, who is her cousin, gave her a drink laced with alcohol, and then offered to escort her home, only to lead her into a bush, then pull her down, tear her panty and defile her. The complainant’s mother, who heard a dog barking, went to check what was going on, only to find the appellant on top of her daughter with his trouser half way down. She raised an alarm and a crowd gathered, leading to “mob justice” being inflicted on the appellant.






8.
The evidence against the appellant was quite incriminating, but was compromised by the evidence of the doctor whose evidence the trial magistrate found inconclusive on the issue of penetration. It was for this reason that the trial magistrate opted to convict the appellant for attempted defilement. The learned Judge of the High Court similarly concluded that the evidence of penetration was inconclusive. Needless to state that the appellant, who had all the intentions of defiling the child, was interrupted whilst in the course of his heinous undertaking.






9.
The trial magistrate, in exercise of her discretion, sentenced the appellant to a term of 15 years’ imprisonment, which was more than the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, provided  under Section 9(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. It is clear that, as adverted to above, there were proper aggravating circumstances that justified the sentence that was imposed on the appellant. In any case, in his first appeal, the appellant did not take any issue with the sentence, as all the grounds of appeal were against his conviction, and so it is not open to him to raise it now, nor is it open to us to address the issue of sentence without the benefit of the opinion of the High Court.






10.
In the above circumstances, and given our limited jurisdiction in interfering with the sentence on the ground of severity, we find no substance in this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed.

Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma, Written and Signed at Kapenguria, (Sitati, J.) dated and Delivered at Bungoma, (Riechi, J.) on 14th May, 2019inHCCRA No. 68 of 2018)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Isaac Wanjala, the appellant herein, was tried and convicted by the SRM’s Court at Sirisia of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. It was alleged that he had defiled M.A.N., a child aged six years.






2.
Following the trial in which four witnesses testified for the prosecution, including the child and her mother, and the appellant gave a sworn statement and called no witness, the trial magistrate found the appellant guilty, convicted him of the offence and sentenced him to life imprisonment.






3.
The appellant lodged an appeal in the High Court, and the High Court, (Sitati, J), having heard the appeal, found that the charge of defilement was proved against the appellant, and that his alibi defence was properly rejected. The learned Judge therefore dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence that was imposed on the appellant.






4.
The appellant is now before us with a second appeal in which he has appealed against both conviction and sentence. The grounds raised include the High Court having misdirected itself in failing to find that the minor could have been injured by some other object; failing to note that there were crucial witnesses who were not called to testify; and also failing to consider the appellant’s defence and mitigating factors. In addition, the appellant contends that the mandatory sentence imposed against him is null and void, and that the life sentence contravenes Article 50(2) of 
the Constitution
.






5.
The appellant has also filed written submissions in which he argued that the prosecution failed to adduce scientific evidence that could prove the case against him; and that the trial court erred in convicting him on the evidence of the child, without looking for corroboration. He submitted that the age of the child was not established as the document tendered was a dedication card which was not produced by the marker, and that the doctor who testified did not identify himself using his registration pin, nor were the appellant and the complainant escorted for medical examination as required by law.






6.
Further, the appellant submitted that the Judge did not address the issue of breaking or missing hymen. He argued that the mere fact that the hymen was missing or broken, did not confirm that sexual intercourse had taken place, as the same could be the result of other factors including vigorous physical activities. He argued that the evidence of identification was not sufficient to implicate him with the offence. He maintained that the charge against him was malicious and false and that the sentence imposed upon him was harsh and excessive, and that the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence denied him the right to a fair trial under Article 50 of 
the Constitution
. He urged the Court to set aside the indefinite life imprisonment sentence that was imposed upon him, and instead substitute it with a term sentence that would give him the opportunity to reform and socially readapt after his prison term.






7.
The respondent did not file any written submissions but during the plenary hearing, Mr. Oyiembo from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP) represented the respondent and made oral submissions. He opposed the appeal urging that the appellant was properly convicted as the ingredients of defilement were established; that the child was six years old as confirmed from the dedication card and the assessment done by the doctor. He submitted that the sentence was proper as the offence was serious and the appellant deserved a deterrent sentence.






8.
We have carefully considered the record of appeal, the submissions and the law. This being a second appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court is limited under Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code to matters of law only. As stated in Kariongo v R [1982] KLR 213 at page 219:
“
A second appeal must be confined to points of law and this Court will not interfere with concurrent findings of facts arrived at in the two courts below unless based on no evidence. The text to be applied on second appeal is whether there was any evidence on which the trial court could find as it did (Reuben Karari c/o Karanja v R. [1956] 17EACA 146)”






9.
The appellant was tried and convicted of the offence of defilement of a six-year-old child. The issue for determination before us is whether the appellant was properly convicted of this offence. Penetration is a critical ingredient of the offence of defilement. The two lower courts made concurrent findings that there was penetration of the child’s sexual organs. This was because the clinical officer who examined her noted bruises on the external part of the labia majora, and also noted that the cervix was swollen and the hymen was not intact. In addition, there was a foul-smelling discharge from the vagina.






10.
The appellant maintained that the evidence that was adduced did not necessarily implicate him with the offence, however the trial magistrate who assessed the demeanor of the child was of the view that she was speaking the truth that she was defiled by the appellant. The trial court was satisfied that the child knew the appellant and identified him by recognition as a neighbor who had visited their home before and this was corroborated by the child’s mother. The trial court was satisfied that the child was speaking the truth.






11.
Under the proviso to Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, a trial court can convict for a sexual offence under the 
Sexual Offences Act
on the evidence of a complainant alone without corroboration. In William Sowa Mbwanga v Republic [2016] eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated as follows:
“The import of the proviso to section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 is that the trial court can convict an accused facing a charge of defilement solely on the evidence of the victim, if for reasons to be recorded, the court is satisfied that the victim is telling the truth. Medical evidence is not mandatory under that proviso, a position which was reiterated thus by this Court in George Kioji v Republic, CR. APP. NO. 270 of 2012 (Nyeri):
“Where available, medical evidence arising from examination of the accused and linking him to the defilement would be welcome. We however hasten to add that such medical evidence is not mandatory or even the only evidence upon which an accused person can properly be convicted for defilement. The court can convict if it is satisfied that there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the defilement was perpetrated by accused person. Indeed, under the proviso to section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya, a court can convict an accused person in a prosecution involving a sexual offence, on the evidence of the victim alone, if the court believes the victim and records the reasons for such belief.”






12.
The learned Judge of the 1
st
 appellate court agreed with the findings of the trial court and found that the appellant was properly recognized by the child as the assailant, and that the child gave his name to her mother. The child also gave a descriptive explanation of exactly how the appellant inserted his “urinating thing into her urinating thing.”






13.
On our part we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence confirming penetration and implicating the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence. The evidence was not simply anchored on the absence of the hymen as the appellant would want us to believe. In the circumstances, the appellant’s purported alibi defence could not stand.






14.
As regards proof of the child’s age, as was stated by this Court in 
Richard Wahome Chege v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2014
 (UR), age is not necessarily proved by production of a birth certificate, the evidence of the mother of a child may be sufficient. In this case apart from the child herself giving her age as six years, the doctor who examined her using her dental formula assessed her age as six years. In addition, a copy of the dedication certificate was also produced to confirm the child’s age. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence that the child was six years old. Thus, all the ingredients of the offence were established and the appellant was properly convicted of the offence of defilement.






15.
As regards the sentence, Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 which is the penal section under which the appellant was charged provides for a mandatory sentence of imprisonment for life, where the child violated is aged eleven years or less. The trial Judge having considered the appellant’s mitigation noted that the sentence provided was a mandatory sentence, and thereby sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment. The learned Judge of the first appellate court dismissed the appeal against both conviction and sentence.






16.
The appellant has argued before us that the mandatory sentence imposed upon him was severe and excessive, and that it violated his constitutional rights. We note however, that in his appeal before the High Court, much as the appellant stated that his appeal was against conviction and sentence, the appellant did not raise any grounds against the sentence. The constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment under Articles 28 and 29(f) of 
the Constitution
, which is different from challenging the constitutionality of minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
, for fettering the discretion of the sentencing court, was not, therefore, raised or preserved as an issue that could be argued before us. In accordance with the Supreme Court decision in Gichuki Mwangi: Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 Others (amicus curio) [2024] 34KLR, the issue of the constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence is not open to us for consideration at this stage.






17.
Finally, under Section 361(1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, severity of sentence is a matter of fact which is not open for our consideration as our jurisdiction is restricted to matters of law only. We come to the conclusion that this appeal has no merit; it is accordingly dismissed in its entirety.

Judgment










1.
The appellant, Paul Kivisi Lusiti, was charged, convicted, and sentenced to death for the offence of murder of Julius Muchoki contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. As per the charge sheet, the incident occurred on 9
th
 October 1996 at Malakisi Police Station.






2.
Dissatisfied with the outcome, the appellant appeals on both conviction and sentence faulting the learned judge for:
i.
Failing to note that the offence of murder was not established.
ii.
Failing to note that the material evidence with regard to the ballistics opinion, which would have exonerated the appellant from the offence was deliberately withheld or suppressed by the prosecution
iii.
Rejecting the appellant’s defence of alibi.
The appellant thus urged us to allow the appeal, and set him at liberty.






3.
The evidence presented at the trial was that, Gladys Nabalayo PW3, George Wekesa Bwire, PW4 and Patrick Nzioki (Patrick), PW10, who shared a house within Malakisi Police Lines together with the appellant and his wife Florence, saw the appellant arrive from Bungoma on the night of 9
th
 October, 1996, at about 7.30 pm. Florence informed the appellant that Sergeant Julius Muchoki, the deceased herein, had visited the residence to inquire why he had not reported on duty to man a nearby roadblock.






4.
This information threw the appellant into a fit of rage, and he insulted and slapped Florence, tore her clothes, and threw a radio she had in her hands, onto the ground. So bad was the rage, that the appellant cocked his gun and threatened to shoot other relatives of his wife who were in the room. They scampered for safety to Patrick’s room. When Patrick asked what was wrong, the appellant said he wanted to kill his wife. Patrick managed to cool down the appellant, advised him to remove the bullets from the gun’s counter, and proceed to his duties. The appellant took his G3 riffle and cocked it, as he headed for the Report Office at Malakisi Police Station, while threatening that he would kill somebody that night. Soon thereafter, sounds of gunshots were heard near the report office, shortly after the appellant left for that direction.






5.
PW1, John Akatu (John) while attending to a call in the radio room, heard gunshots and screams; and shortly, he saw Sergeant Julius Muchoki, (deceased) fall down before reaching the Report Office, while being closely followed by the appellant. John saw the appellant pumping several bullets at the deceased and shooting indiscriminately at the radio room and as a result, the deceased got injured at the legs, pelvis, shoulder, abdomen and at the right hand, his G3 rifle also got shattered in the process. John witnessed all this with the assistance of electric lights inside and outside the report office.






6.
Eventually, the appellant headed back to his residence, where Patrick, having heard the gun shots, sat, armed on the alert. He saw the appellant approaching, while aiming at him. A struggle ensued between them, with several bullets fired by the appellant, but they did not get his real or imagined target. Eventually Patrick managed to wrestle down the appellant, disarmed him of the G3 rifle with the assistance of one George and managed to arrest the appellant thereby thwarting his attempt to flee from the premises of Malakisi Police Station.






7.
A postmortem conducted by Dr. Protus Wangila Simiyu, PW6, on the body of the deceased revealed that the deceased died as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest due to massive hemorrhage following a head injury due to multiple gunshots.






8.
Placed on his defence, the appellant elected to give an unsworn statement in which he denied being at the scene of the crime when the offence was committed as he had gone to visit his sick sister who was admitted at Kakamega Provincial Hospital in the morning of 9
th
 October 1996. He reported on duty at 8.05 pm only to find people in groups discussing. He was intercepted and assaulted by Patrick while on his way to the report office. He claimed to have been a very close friend of the late Sergeant Julius Muchoki, and this made so many officers jealous of him; that Patrick was bitter because Sergeant Julius Muchoki shifted him from his quarters to pave way for other officers who were participating in a shooting competition within Malakisi Police Station; and the case against him was a frame up fueled by jealousy.






9.
By a judgment delivered on 30
th
 January, 2006, the trial court found the appellant guilty and convicted him of the offence of murder. The appellant was sentenced to death.






10.
In support of the appeal, it is submitted that the testimony by PC Fange Ali, PW9, created doubt as to the identity, of the person who had the offending firearm, as he stated that he did not know whether the appellant had a gun. The appellant also placed a stain on the movement register that was relied on by the prosecution, since PW9 stated that one could not hold a gun for more than 20 days; the appellant had explained that during the same period he had no gun for more than two days, and whenever an officer took a gun, it was the custom that upon return, the movement of the guns would be recorded in the register; and that this reinforced the appellant's testimony that a gun was always returned for safety purposes, particularly in circumstances where a house.






11.
The appellant places doubt on two arguments raised by the prosecution namely that at the time of the incident, there was no operation which could have enabled the officer to hold guns for more than the prescribed days; hence the argument by PW10 that there was an operation was not true. Secondly, that the appellant returned his gun before he left to attend to his sick sister, thus he had no gun when the shooting took place.






12.
It is the appellant’s contention that it would have been appropriate to bring such material witnesses as the officer who was in charge of the armoury and arms movement register to testify rather than bringing witness that were less material before the court; and that the failure by the prosecution to bring key witness and the failure to bring a forensic expert punched holes to the prosecution's case, hence the conviction and sentence of the appellant ought to be set aside, varied or reviewed.






13.
The appellant also argues that there was no scientific analysis or ballistic report filed to support the alleged murder; and that the trial court erroneously relied on the testimony of PW7, regarding the alleged recovery of 23 spent cartridges from the scene of the crime, to hold the appellant guilty.






14.
It is further argued by the appellant that there were multiple fire arms used at the scene, as the evidence of PW3 was that the shooting started at around 7.30 pm; went for 10 -15 minutes and that PW3 could not tell whether the gunshot at the police lines and the ones from the report office came from one gun, thus raising reasonable doubts as to the culpability of the appellant.






15.
The appellant also faulted the trial court for erroneously rejecting the alibi defence, arguing that the learned judge ought to have treated the evidence of P.C Nzioki with circumspection, as the appellant had stated they were not in good terms; and it is the responsibility of the prosecution to disprove the defence of alibi. In support of this proposition, we are referred to 
Charles Anjare Mwamusi v. R, CRA No. 226 of 2002
, where this Court stated:
“
An alibi raises a specific defense and an accused person who puts forward an alibi as an answer to the charge preferred against him does not in law thereby assume any burden of proving that answer and it is sufficient if an alibi introduces into the mind of a court a doubt that is not unreasonable.”






16.
It is also pointed out that the appellant was sentenced to suffer death on 30
th
 January, 2006 when the mandatory sentence still stood, that with the advent of the Supreme Court decision in Francis Karioko Muruateu and Anor’ vs. Republic, Petition No. 15 & 16 of 2015 (consolidated [2017] eKLR, (referred to as Muruatetu 1) and Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic; Katiba Institute & 5 Others (Amicus Curiae) [2021] eKLR (referred to as Muruatetu 2), sentencing is recognized as an exercise of judicial discretion; and when imposing a sentence, the mitigation by the accused person ought to be considered.






17.
In opposing the appeal, the respondent contends that the prosecution proved their case to the required standard, and that the death of the deceased was not in dispute.






18.
As to who caused the death, the respondent points out that PW5, PC Ochanda, testified that he was in the report office together with PW1 and the deceased; then just as he was leaving the report office within the station, he heard gun shots coming from the direction of the police lines, he ran and took cover behind the cells, even as more gunshots rent the air, followed by a scream from the report office; he later proceeded to the house of Inspector Aliwa, PW7 the Officer Commanding the Station; and reported what had transpired.






19.
The respondent further contends that PW3 was directed to go and disarm the person who was shooting, and he obliged, even as more gunshots pierced the air, leading to PW3 taking cover by lying on the ground for about 10 minutes; he then heard his colleagues walking towards the station and one of them saying that major, Sergeant Muchoki had been shot dead. PW3 left his cover and went to the station, where he found the office full of blood with Sergeant Muchoki lying in a pool of blood with several bullet wounds; and an injured PC John screaming in the radio room. PC John was rushed to Lumboka hospital; and PW3 found the appellant at the station, under arrest by his other colleagues, who tied him up with a rope, before placing him in the cells.






20.
The respondent points out that PW3 confirmed that:
There are lights in the radio room and report office as well as outside the report office by(sic) security lights behind and in front of the station. It is from normal electricity. There is a counter in the report office in front of the door”.






21.
The respondent argues that PC John saw the appellant shooting the deceased. After firing at the deceased many times, the appellant went where PC John was hiding and fired at him. This evidence was corroborated by PW5, PW6, and PW7, SP. Walter Aliwa, who saw the body of the deceased and the injuries sustained.






22.
Regarding malice aforethought, the respondent argues that it was proved as the injuries inflicted by the appellant caused the death of the deceased; that there was sufficient evidence that the appellant acted with malice aforethought as the appellant had the intention to cause death or to do grievous harm to the deceased; and that the appellant was well aware of his actions and intended the consequences of the said acts. The respondent relied on the case of Ali Salim Bahati & Another vs. Republic [2019] eKLR in which this Court was of the view that, a vicious attack on the deceased was also a clear indication of the intended consequences of an offender’s action, that is, the death of the deceased; and also established malice aforethought on the part of the appellants.






23.
With regard to the failure to produce a ballistic report, the respondent contends that the trial court agreed with the prosecution that the appellant was the one in possession of the firearm that caused the death of the deceased; that it was proved that the appellant was given G3 riffle No. A3 6926995 with forty (40) rounds of ammunition on 14
th
 September 1996 and assigned duties of manning a roadblock; that the arms movement register further showed that the same gun was handed over to DCIO Bungoma on 10
th
 October, 1996 and 23 spent cartridges were recovered from the scene.






24.
In dismissing the appellant's alibi defence, the learned judge termed it a made-up story that was uncorroborated. On sentence, the respondent concedes to setting aside the mandatory death sentence and submits that a term sentence be imposed.






25.
We have carefully considered the record of appeal, submissions by counsel, the authorities cited and the law. This being a first appeal, this Court is mindful of its duty as 1
st
 appellate Court as was well articulated by this Court in Erick Otieno Arum vs. Republic [2006] eKLR as follows:
“
It is now well settled, that a trial court has the duty to carefully examine and analyze the evidence adduced in a case before it and come to a conclusion only based on the evidence adduced and as analyzed. This is a duty no court should run away from or play down. In the same way, a court hearing a first appeal (i.e.) a first appellate court) also has a duty imposed on it by law to carefully examine and analyze afresh the evidence on record and come to its own conclusion on the same but always observing that the trial court had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and observing their demeanor and so the first appellate court would give allowance for the same.”






26.
For the prosecution to secure a conviction on the charge of murder, it has to prove 3 ingredients against the accused person.
In the case of Anthony Ndegwa Ngari vs. Republic [2014] eKLR the elements of the offence of murder were listed as follows:
a.
the death of the deceased occurred,
b.
that the accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased,
c.
that the accused had malice aforethought.






27.
The death of the deceased has been proved by all the prosecution witnesses who saw the body of the deceased and the injuries thereon including PW5, 6 & 7. PW6 performed the post mortem and confirmed that the cause of death was as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest due to massive hemorrhage following a head injury due to multiple gunshots. He produced the report as Ex.2.






28.
Could the deceased’s death be attributed to the appellant’s actions? Was there proof that the appellant committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased? As to who caused the death, PC John (PW2) stated in his evidence that he saw the appellant shooting the deceased. Next, the prosecution needed to adduce evidence to establish that the appellant had malice aforethought when he committed the act which caused the death.






29.
The ingredients of murder were explained in the case of Roba Galma Wario vs. Republic [2015] eKLR, where the court held that:
“
For the conviction of murder to be sustained, it is imperative to prove that the death of the deceased was caused by the appellant, and that he had required malice aforethought. Without malice aforethought, the appellant would be guilty of manslaughter, as it would mean that the death of the deceased during the brawl was not intentional.”






30.
Malice aforethought has been defined by the Court of Appeal in several cases, in Nzuki vs. Republic [1993] KLR 171, the Court of Appeal held that before an act can be murder, it must be aimed at someone and in addition it must be an act committed with the following intentions, the test of which is always subjective to the accused.


intention to cause death,


intention to cause grievous bodily harm,


where the accused knows that there is risk that death or grievous bodily harm will ensue from his acts and commits them without lawful excuse.








31.
PC John’s evidence on cross examination in reference to the appellant was that:
“
As he shot, he said in Swahili ""nitamaliza nyinyi” I included it in my statement. I forgot to say so in the main evidence today. It is not true that it is not the accused who shot at me. The accused is the one who shot the deceased and shot at him(sic). I saw him with the help of the light at the report office and I saw him with my own eyes”.
Taking into consideration the testimonies of PW5, 6 and PW7; the use of his G3 rifle to repeatedly pump several bullets into the deceased, is proof that there was intention to cause death or intention to cause grievous harm and that the appellant knew there is risk of death or grievous bodily harm.






32.
As regards scientific analysis of ballistics examination, we take note that the learned judge in his judgment was persuaded by the evidence of PW10 that the gun was recovered from the appellant, as corroborated by the entry in the Malakisi Arms Movement Register which showed that the said firearm SN 3692699 with 40 rounds of ammunition was issued to the appellant. Further, that there was no evidence that the appellant surrendered the firearm earlier than 9
th
 October 1996;






33.
The learned judge also considered the evidence that PW7 who took possession of the gun, had also recovered 23 spent cartridges from the scene; and that although the firearm was not subjected to ballistics examination; the appellant in his defence did not deny being in possession of the gun; or how it came into the possession of PW7; nor the subsequent handing over to DCIO Bungoma.






34.
We indeed further note that the appellant did not produce any evidence to show that he had surrendered the gun prior to the incident. We find that there was no evidence to suggest that another firearm was used to shoot, nor was there any explanation given as to why from the one magazine issued with 20 bullets, only eight were found intact after the shooting. We concur with the learned judge that despite the lack of a ballistics report, the chain of evidence was so well connected as to link only the appellant to the shooting, to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.






35.
With regard to the alibi defence, the learned judge in his judgment considered it to be a made up story incapable of being believed. On our part, we find that alibi defence did not destabilize the evidence of the prosecution which put him at the scene of crime, as confirmed by PW1, and PW10; and that he left his residence in an agitated mood, spiked by the fact that the deceased had gone to look for him as he had not reported on duty.






36.
We detect no error on the part of the learned judge, either in assessing the facts, or in applying the law and the legal principles, leading to the conclusion that the prosecution proved their case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt; and that the conviction was safe.






37.
With regard to the severity of sentence, Section 379 (1(a) and (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against sentence from the High Court. This Court notes that the respondent concedes to the reduction of the sentence that was imposed on the appellant from the mandatory sentence to a term sentence.






38.
In Francis Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic, the Supreme Court of Kenya Petition No. 15 & 16 of 2016, the court gave sentencing guidelines with regard to mitigation before sentencing in murder cases at paragraph 71 as follows:
a.
Age of the offender,
b.
Being a first offender,
c.
Whether the offender pleaded guilty,
d.
Character and record of the offender,
e.
Commission of the offence in response to gender- based violence,
f.
Remorsefulness of the offender,
g.
Any other relevant factor.






39.
In the same case, the Court in regard to the application of mitigation by the accused before sentencing held as follows:
“
it is during mitigation, after conviction and before sentencing, that the offender’s version of events may be heavy with pathos necessitating the court to consider an aspect that may have been unclear during the trial process calling for pity more that censure or in the converse impose the death penalty.’’






40.
In 
Chai vs. Republic (Criminal Appeal 30 of 2020
) [2022] KECA 495 (KLR) (1 APRIL 2022) this Court differently constituted, held that the two holdings of the Supreme Court in the Muruatetu I (supra) case makes it very clear and underscores the importance of receiving and considering mitigating circumstances, and also of applying applicable sentencing guidelines, even though the latter are a guide.






41.
To justify a death sentence, the ruling should have spoken to it, showing in black and white what the court considered. In the absence of any demonstration of factors that could have led to such a sentence we find the same to be excessive. We nonetheless take note of the brutal manner in which the appellant executed his actions, pumping several bullets into the deceased, as though to confirm that he was totally dead, and this was an act committed by a member of the disciplined forces who should have known better, worse still acting in such a depraved manner against his superior, without any hint of provocation. We find these to be aggravating circumstances which at best ought to attract a long period of being kept away from the free society.






42.
Consequently, we find that the appellant’s conviction for the offence of murder was safe and upholds the said conviction. We however, allow the appeal against the sentence and set aside the death sentence and substitute the same with a sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment. We recognize that the appellant was arrested immediately after committing the offence, and placed in cells on 9
th
 October 1996; he remained in remand until January 2006 when he was sentenced. By dint of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, we are bound to take into account this period spent in remand, in meting out the sentence. The result is that the 30 years’ sentence shall take effect from 9
th
 October 1996, which was the date of arrest and incarceration. It is only to this very limited extent that the appeal on sentence succeeds.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
The Applicant filed a Notice of Motion Application dated 17
th
 May 2024 under Order 8 Rules 3(3) and (5), and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, Section 1A, 1B and 3A and of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and all enabling provisions of the law. The Applicant sought the following orders;
a.
The Court be pleased to grant the Applicant leave to amend the application dated 29
th
 March, 2024 as shown on the amended application filed herewith.
b.
The Court to grant the Applicant 14 days to file the amended application.
c.
The amended application be deemed as duly filed upon payment of the requisite fees.






2.
The Application was supported by the grounds on the face of it and by the sworn Affidavit of Colin Warutere Munene who stated that it is necessary to amend the application dated 29
th
 March, 2024 to correctly reflect the name of the Respondent/Administrator who is now deceased and a new administrator was appointed on the 7
th
 May, 2024; This information of the demise of the administrator came to the knowledge of the deponent after he had already filed the application;






3.
Leave to amend the original application is necessary as it is tainted with an inadvertent defect which needs to be corrected for clarity purposes. The present application has been filed on bonafide grounds and no prejudice will be caused to the Respondents’ rights if the application is allowed. Further, the Application has been made without any delay since the discovery of the demise of the administrator. The Applicant also stated that if this application is not allowed there will substantial loss and hardship that will be occasioned to the estate of the deceased.






4.
The Applicant made oral submissions and the application was not challenged by the Respondents.








Issues for Determination


5.
Having considered the Application, response and the written submissions by the respective parties; the following issues are for determination;
i.
Whether the Applicant should be granted leave to amend the application.








Analysis


6.
The applicable law is found at Section 100 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 which permits the Court to allow amendments of pleadings at any time during the proceedings for the purposes of determining the real questions in dispute. Refer to the case of Bosire Ogero v Royal Media Services [2015] eKLR.






7.
The provisions of Order 8 Rule 3 and 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 are also applicable and the Court may at any stage, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just, allow any party to amend its pleadings notwithstanding that such an application is made after the expiry of a period of limitation upon which the other party might be entitled to rely or substitute a party or alter the capacity in which a party sues or even add or substitute a new cause of action.






8.
In the case of St Patrick’s Hill School Ltd v Bank of Africa Kenya Ltd [2018] eKLR the Court of Appeal set out the principles governing the amendment of pleadings as follows: -
a.
The power of the court to allow amendments is intended to determine the true substantive merits of the case.
b.
The amendments should be timeously applied for.
c.
Power to amend can be exercised by the court at any stage of the proceedings.
d.
That as a general rule however late the amendment is sought to be made it should be allowed if made in good faith provided costs can compensate the other side.
e)
The plaintiff will not be allowed to reframe his case or his claim if by an amendment of the plaint the defendant would be deprived of his right to rely on the Limitations Act subject however to powers of the court to still allow and amendment notwithstanding the expiry of current period of limitation.






9.
In Harrison C. Kariuki v Blueshield Insurance Company Ltd [2006] eKLR the court referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Central Kenya Ltd v Trust Bank Ltd [2000] EALR 365 and held that: -
“
The guiding principle in applications to amend pleadings is that the same will be liberally and freely permitted, unless prejudice and injustice will be occasioned to the opposite party. There will normally be no justice if the other party can be compensated by an appropriate award of costs for any expense, delay or bother occasioned to him. The main issue is that it be in the interests of justice that the amendments sough be permitted in order that the real question in controversy between the parties be determined.”






10.
Leave to amend pleading is at the discretion of the court which must not apply this discretion arbitrarily as was echoed in the case of Kassam v Bank of Baroda (Kenya) Ltd [2002] eKLR. The general principle while granting leave for amendment is that it should be allowed provided that it is not done in bad faith and it does not occasion injustice to the other party.






11.
It is the Court’s view that the Applicant has not proposed to amend the Prayers in the original application dated 29/03/2023 and that the amendment seeks to bring in the new administrator as a party to the cause.






12.
Another principle is that an amendment should not be allowed if it causes injustice to the other side. It is the Court’s opinion that by allowing the amendment there will be no injustice if the Respondents can be compensated by costs.






13.
This court is satisfied that the said proposed amendment is necessary for the determination of the real issues in dispute in this Cause; the proposed amendment does not introduce a new cause of action or change the character of the case but arise from the same set of facts as those set out in the original application necessary to provide clarity of the parties involved that will enable the Court to conclusively determine all issues between the parties to the suit.








Findings and Determination


14.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds that the application has merit and it is hereby allowed;
ii.
The Applicant is hereby granted leave to amend and serve the Amended application within fourteen (14) days upon payment of the requisite fees. The Respondents are at liberty to file an amended Response within fourteen (14) days after service.
iii.
The Applicant to bear the costs of this application.
iv.
Mention on 27/11/2024 to fix a hearing date for the application.
v.
Mention Notice to Respondent.
Orders Accordingly.

Cause No. 408 of 1998 pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. The application is supported by the grounds on the face of it and the affidavit of the 2
nd
 applicant sworn on 29
th
 November 2023.






2.
This application is a continuation of a raging succession dispute and to contextualize it, it is necessary to capture the background, albeit in summary. The dispute relates to the estate of the late Ezekiel Lukalo Aluda. By a judgment of this Court, differently constituted (Onyango Otieno, Azangalala & Kantai, JJ.A.), delivered on 11
th
 July 2014, this Court set aside orders made in the succession cause for the distribution of the estate and cancelled the certificate of grant. It directed the hearing of the succession dispute on the issue of the distribution of the estate amongst the rightful beneficiaries. Consequently, in an elaborate judgment delivered on 27
th
 May 2022, the High Court (Musyoka, J.) identified 13 beneficiaries of the estate. However, the learned judge held it was premature to distribute the estate before parties led further evidence on the status of some titles; whether some beneficiaries had received gifts inter vivos; whether some properties had been sold, and who were beneficiaries of the transactions, among other issues. The learned judge gave directions to the effect that he would allocate a mention date after 90 days from the date of the judgement to allow the parties to decide on the course of action they wished to take before making the final orders on the distribution of the estate. The judge also granted the parties leave of 28 days to challenge his decision, if necessary.






3.
The applicants are aggrieved by the said judgment and filed a Notice of Appeal as well as this application. The gist of the Motion is that the trial court disregarded the directions issued by this Court dated 11
th
 July 2014, in its judgment dated 27
th
 May 2022. Consequently, the learned judge made serious contradictions by including beneficiaries who have not survived the deceased’s estate, and calling for fresh evidence in the dispute. The applicants further faulted the trial court for failing to declare that only three properties that survived the deceased namely Trans Nzoia/Ki
psoen/1048
, North Maragoli/Kegindi/471 and North Maragoli/Kisatiru/782.






4.
The applicants contended that the application was arguable for the following reasons: the legitimate beneficiaries stood to suffer irreparable harm; the appeal would be rendered an academic exercise if stay was not granted; it was only just that the application be allowed; and the application was filed timeously.






5.
The application is opposed. In his replying affidavit dated 4
th
 December 2023, the respondent urged this Court to dismiss the application for the following reasons: that the application failed to meet the threshold set out in rule 5 (2) (b) of this Court’s Rules; the deceased’s estate is yet to be distributed; the application is premature; and that the applicants were intent on frustrating the distribution process.






6.
The applicants in response, filed a further affidavit sworn on 4
th
 January 2024. They reiterated the averments set out in their application save to add that the trial court was only required to consider the undisputed facts in the distribution of the deceased’s estate; and the matter was poised to be mentioned before the trial court for further directions, and therefore this Court needed to stay the proceedings.






7.
The application was heard virtually on 19
th
 March 2024. The applicants were represented by learned counsel Mr. Wachakana while learned counsel Mr. Munyendo was present for the respondent. The applicants relied on their written submissions dated 14
th
 December 2024. They rehashed the contents of their application and affidavits praying that the application be allowed as it met the threshold for grant of an order for stay of proceedings. The respondent relied on his written submissions dated 12
th
 May 2024. He urged this Court to dismiss the application as it was frivolous since there was no decree capable of execution. Finally, the trial judge was yet to distribute the estate.






8.
The principles enunciated in an application under rule 5 (2) (b) of this Court’s Rules for an order of stay of proceedings pending appeal or intended appeal, are settled. An applicant must demonstrate that the intended appeal or appeal (if any) is arguable and not merely frivolous. Secondly, that the appeal, or intended appeal, if successful, would be rendered nugatory absent stay. (See Stanley Kang’ethe Kinyanjui vs. Tony Ketter & 5 others [2013] eKLR).






9.
In the grounds in support of the application, the applicants have argued that the learned judge contradicted the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the extent that some beneficiaries that are identified as wives are married elsewhere; and that some beneficiaries are not children of the deceased. It is trite that an arguable ground must not necessarily succeed. In the case of Kenya Commercial Bank Limited vs. Nicholas Ombija [2009] eKLR, this Court stated as follows: “An “arguable” appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the Court.” In our view, those grounds raised by the applicants are arguable. As to whether they will succeed, that will be dealt with by the bench that will hear and determine the appeal. Accordingly, the applicants have met the first limb of rule 5(2) (b).






10.
On the second limb, whether the appeal will be rendered nugatory, we note that the learned judge did not make final orders and that there is no decree capable of execution. The parties were given a chance to lead further evidence on the distribution of the estate before final orders could be issued. This means that the applicants have a chance to lead evidence and prove the issues that they are aggrieved with. In such a case it is difficult to understand what will be rendered nugatory as argued by the applicants. We are not satisfied that the intended appeal will be rendered nugatory as each party will have a chance to appeal against the orders that will be made on the distribution of the estate. Therefore, the applicants have failed to satisfy the second limb of the twin principles for the grant of the order for stay of proceedings.






11.
In conclusion, as the applicants had to satisfy both limbs of the twin principles; and as already stated, the applicants have failed to meet the second limb of the twin principles, that the intended appeal will be rendered nugatory absent stay; we dismiss the application with costs to the respondent.

Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Siaya (Makau, J.) on 9th February 2017 in HCCRC No. 40 of 2014 & HCCRC No. 50 of 2015)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Douglas Musa Litunya (the appellant herein) was charged before the High Court, with the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. It is alleged that on 21
st
 June 2011 at Kaindakwa Estate, Siaya Township Location in Siaya Sub County within Siaya County, he murdered William Omukunda Odongo. The appellant was tried and convicted of the offence and sentenced to death. Being dissatisfied and aggrieved with both the conviction and sentence, the appellant has now appealed to this Court.






2.
This being a first appeal, we are mindful of our duty as 1
st
 appellate court which was well articulated in Erick Otieno Arum vs. Republic [2006] eKLR as follows:
“It is now well settled, that a trial court has the duty to carefully examine and analyze the evidence adduced in a case before it and come to a conclusion only based on the evidence adduced and as analyzed. This is a duty no court should run away from or play down. In the same way, a court hearing a first appeal (i.e.) a first appellate court) also has a duty imposed on it by law to carefully examine and analyze afresh the evidence on record and come to its own conclusion on the same but always observing that the trial court had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and observing their demeanour and so the first appellate court would give allowance for the same.”






3.
The prosecution’s case as presented before the trial court, is that the deceased and five others who included Daniel Wafune Oduor, PW2 and Fredrick Akhanda Ohindo, PW3 were at their house in Siaya town, rented by their boss, Wycliffe Ogong’a, At around 8.00pm while PW2, and 5 others including the deceased were in their room preparing supper, the appellant, Douglas knocked at the door; entered the room and called the deceased outside. The deceased went out leaving the door open. The pair talked for 5 minutes then PW2 & PW3 heard them struggle as they pushed each other into the room; and the deceased fell on the mattress on the floor. A lantern lamp inside the room enabled them to see what was happening.






4.
PW2 noted that the deceased was bleeding, from the head; and holding on to his abdomen, from which the intestines were protruding. PW2 rushed to fetch his boss from a nearby pub, and upon return they found the deceased already dead. The police were called and took the body to the mortuary. After investigation the appellant was charged with the offence.






5.
In his unsworn statement, the appellant denied the offence, and raised an alibi defence, stating that at the close of his business on the material day, he went home prepared a meal, ate then slept. At 1.00am he heard a knock on the door, and found police officers who told him they were looking for him; he was arrested, taken to the police station where he was told he had killed someone; and subsequently charged with an offence he knew nothing of.






6.
The trial Judge framed the issue for determination as being:
whether the ingredients constituting a charge of murder had been proved;
whether the deceased was fatally injured by the appellant and if so,
whether the appellant acted with malice aforethought.






7.
The trial court found that from the evidence of PW1 - PW5, there was no dispute about the death, as this was confirmed by the witnesses who saw the appellant and the deceased engaging in a physical encounter, and also saw the head and abdominal injuries; then returned to find the deceased lying dead at the scene, as well as the evidence of PW1, who identified his body to the doctor before post mortem; and of course the corroborative evidence of Dr. Metho, PW4, who testified on behalf of Dr. Biko, that the deceased had a 6cm cut wound on the parietal aspect of the head, penetrating abdominal injury, entry wound on the right hypochondrial region wound approximately 4cm with intestines spilling out of the abdominal wound, several wounds mainly in the small gut with leakage of intestinal contents onto the peritoneal cavity. The cause of death was due to a penetrating abdominal injury with damage to the small gut.






8.
As to who caused the death, the trial court took into consideration the appellant’s alibi defence, and weighed it against the evidence of PW2 and PW3 which placed the appellant at the scene. The learned judge observed that PW2 and PW3 were able to see and identify the appellant, who served them meals for a period of over a week, as a worker at Equator Hotel in Siaya. The court was thus satisfied that on the material night there was sufficient light from the lantern to enable PW2 & 3 recognize the accused. The alibi defence was thus rejected as unsustainable and an afterthought, having been raised for the first time in his defence.






9.
On malice aforethought the court recounted PW2 & PW3’s evidence that the appellant knocked at their door and called the deceased outside, where they heard them talking and then a struggle ensued, and thereafter the deceased fell on the mattress bleeding from his head and his intestines out. From the evidence the court found that the appellant had planned to commit the murder and that the accused had knowledge that his act of stabbing the deceased would cause death or grievous harm.






10.
Having considered all the evidence in its totality, the trial court found the appellant guilty of the offence as charged and sentenced him to death.






11.
The appellant has raised 4 grounds in the memorandum of appeal, that: the learned trial judge erred by relying on the testimonies of PW2 and PW3 which were marred with contradictions and inconsistencies that rendered the prosecution evidence was unsafe to base conviction upon; the learned trial judge erred in failing to fully appreciate the facts of the case, thus drawing inferences and reaching conclusions that are not supported by evidence; the trial judge failed to appreciate the appellant's mitigation; and the learned trial judge imposed an excessively harsh and unconstitutional sentence. He thus urges us to allow his appeal; quash the sentence that was imposed upon him; and/or vary the sentence by imposing a reduced jail term.






12.
The appellant concedes that there was a death and the cause of said death as stated by the Doctor, but the contention is whether the appellant’s actions or omissions caused the death and whether the appellant had malice afore thought. The appellant submits that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, especially with regard to establishing that he had malice aforethought.






13.
The appellant argues that PW2 & PW3 gave conflicting accounts of the happenings on the night in question with regard to how the deceased ended up falling on the mattress, in that PW2 claimed that the deceased fell onto the mattress that was on the floor after the appellant and the deceased got into an argument and started struggling and pushing each other inside the house; and that the deceased was holding his stomach at this point when he noticed that his intestines were sticking out of his stomach and his head was bleeding. That, prior to this altercation, PW2 did not mention hearing any screams coming from the deceased, he only heard them arguing; yet PW3 on the other hand, claimed to have heard the deceased screaming while the dueling pair were outside.






14.
The appellant submits that there is also inconsistency as to how the deceased entered into the house, as PW2 claimed that the deceased entered into the house alone, whereas PW3 claimed that he got in with the appellant. We are urged to resolve the contradictions in favour of the appellant, drawing from the case of Richard Munene vs. Republic [2018] eKLR, which stated that contradiction or inconsistency in the evidence of the prosecution witness go to discredit that witness as being unreliable; and that where contradictions, discrepancies and inconsistencies are proved, they must be resolved in favour of the accused person.






15.
The respondent on the other hand submits that the prosecution witnesses were consistent in their recalling of the events that took place leading to the death of the deceased; and even if other witnesses were to be called, there would be minor contradictions that would not shake the substance of the prosecution case. To buttress this position, the respondent seeks refuge in the case of Joseph Maina Mwangi vs. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 73 of 1993 (Tunoi, Lakha and Bosire JJA), where the learned judges stated:
“In any trial there are bound to be discrepancies. An appellate court in considering those discrepancies must be guided by the wording of section 382 of Criminal Procedure Code viz whether such discrepancies are so fundamental as to cause prejudice to the appellant or they are inconsequential to the conviction and sentences.”






16.
We have considered this argument, but our view is that these discrepancies are not substantial as it is a fact that the appellant knocked at the door, called out the deceased where they had an argument, a scuffle ensued and the deceased fell on the floor on the mattress. Indeed, the scuffle is the reason why the deceased was able to make it that far; not ruling out the flight or fright response to dangerous situations.






17.
The appellant also submits that the prosecution failed to demonstrate that the appellant’s action caused the death; that the testimonies of both PW2 and PW3, only revealed that the appellant had merely called the deceased to the door to have a conversation; and there was no evidence indicating that the appellant displayed aggression or appeared upset upon entering the house to call the deceased. It is thus argued, that the subsequent disagreement or argument between the pair cannot be considered evidence of malice on the part of the appellant.






18.
In this regard, the respondent submits that the evidence provided by PW2 and PW3 clearly placed the appellant at the scene and also saw the appellant inflicting an injury upon the deceased; the witnesses also stated that there was enough light for them to clearly identify the appellant who was not a stranger to them as they knew him to be an employee at a nearby hotel (Equator Hotel). The court was satisfied that the accused was properly identified and/or recognized by the lantern lamp light and he was also a co-worker of PW2, and PW3, and further that the prosecution witnesses placed the accused at the scene. It is this Court’s view that the trial court was correct in finding the fact the accused went to the deceased’s house, called him outside, proceeded to have an altercation with the deceased after which the deceased appeared with injuries.






19.
It is further argued that evidence presented suggested a lack of premeditation or deliberate intent on the part of the appellant; that there was no evidence alluding to any prior enmity, motive, or ill will between the appellant and the deceased, which could have contributed to the presence of malice aforethought. That in any event, the circumstances surrounding the incident, as described by the prosecution witnesses, did not support a conclusion of deliberate intent to cause harm or death.






20.
In this regard, the respondent submits that malice aforethought was established from the appellant’s conduct - he went to the deceased’s place of residence, called him out, and proceeded to inflict the fatal injury leading to his ultimate demise; the part of the body targeted and the nature and extent of injury occasioned which ultimately led to the demise of the deceased as opined by the Doctor who conducted the post mortem and concluded the cause of death as “abdominal injury with damage to small gut”;






21.
We have considered the arguments presented on this limb; and we pose the question, how then would one explain that after the argument and scuffle, the deceased had the injuries, and the only interaction he had was with the appellant? We are of the considered view that the trial court was correct in drawing the conclusion that the appellant went to the deceased’s house, called him outside, proceeded to have an altercation with the deceased after which the deceased appeared with injuries; and the circumstances and chain of events clearly pointed to the appellant as the culprit.






22.
In Omar vs. Republic (2010) 2KLR 19 at page 29, this Court stated:
“
So by the appellant hitting the deceased on the neck with a bottle, he must have intended to cause her at least grievous harm. Indeed, the blow using a bottle caused a fatal wound on the deceased. The evidence clearly shows the appellant had the necessary malice aforethought.’’






23.
We adopt the same line of reasoning as in the Omar case (supra), taking note that the appellant argued with the deceased, had an altercation with the deceased; after which the deceased appeared with injuries.






24.
The appellant also submits that the knife found at the appellant’s house during the arrest was not sufficient evidence of guilt as the said knife was not sent to the government chemist for testing. To this, the respondent argues that a murder weapon need not be produced and the same will not be fatal to the prosecution’s case. In support of this proposition reference is made to the case of Ekai vs. Republic (1981) KLR 569, where this Court rejected the argument that failure to produce the murder weapon is in itself fatal to a conviction. In that case the court found that even though the murder weapon had not been produced, the post mortem examination had established beyond all reasonable doubt that the fatal injury had been caused by a sharp weapon. We are also referred to Karani vs. Republic (2010)1 KLR 73 at page 79 & Ramdahan Kombe vs. Republic CR.A No. 168 of 2002 - MSA. We are in agreement that the failure to produce a murder weapon does not render the conviction unsafe, the evidence sufficiently demonstrated that the fatal injury was inflicted using a sharp object – consistent with what the prosecution witnesses said was used in the attack.






25.
The appellant at the hearing concentrated his appeal on sentencing, drawing from the decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic [2017l eKLR, where the court expressed the view that:
“
Section 204 of the Penal Code deprives the Court of the use of judicial discretion in a matter of life and death. Such law can only be regarded as harsh, unjust and unfair. The mandatory nature deprives the Courts of their legitimate jurisdiction to exercise discretion not to impose the death sentence in appropriate cases. Where a court listens to mitigating circumstances but has, nonetheless, to impose a set sentence, the sentence imposed fails to conform to the tenets of fair trial that accrue to accused persons under Articles 25 of 
the Constitution
; an absolute right.""






26.
It is on account of the foregoing, that the appellant argues that the imposition of the death penalty is excessively severe, surpassing what is justified, given the circumstances of this case, and taking into consideration the appellant’s mitigating factors. We are therefore urged to find fault with the sentence meted out by the trial court and first appellate court, drawing from the Francis Muruatetu case (supra) where the court held:
“
Consequently, we find that Section 204 of the Penal Code is inconsistent with 
the Constitution
 and invalid to the extent that it provides for the mandatory death sentence for murder.""






27.
The respondent submits that Muruatetu case as relied upon does not apply for reason that in this case the learned judge did not mete out the sentence of death against the appellant due to its mandatory nature. That the learned judge duly exercised his discretion whereby the appellant was given a chance to mitigate after which his mitigation was duly considered, but the court could not ignore the most cruel manner in which the deceased met his death; and the appellant was deserving of the mandatory sentence provided by law.






28.
Nonetheless, the respondent submits that in the event that this Court agrees with the appellant and makes a decision to consider resentencing, then; Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. R [2017 eKLR] should be applied in re- sentencing. In that case, the Court held that:
“
The Mandatory nature of the death sentence as provided for under section 204 of the Penal code is hereby declared unconstitutional. For the avoidance of doubt, this order does not disturb the validity of the death sentence as contemplated under Article 26(3) of 
the Constitution
.’’






29.
Picking from the guidelines given by the Supreme Court in relation to sentencing, the respondent points out that the appellant has not even attempted to inform the court with sufficient reasons and documentation as to his ability to benefit from a reduction of sentence. We are thus urged to make a finding that the appellant was rightfully convicted for the offense of Murder contrary to section 203 and if the court deems it fit to resentence the appellant then he be sentenced to at least forty (40) years, as Justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done.






30.
This Court also notes that the respondent conceded to the setting aside of the death sentence imposed. With regard to the severity of sentence, Section 379 (1)(a) & (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for this court’s jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against sentence from the High Court sitting as the trial court where the sentence is fixed by law.






31.
In Francis Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic, the Supreme Court of Kenya Petition No. 15 & 16 of 2016, the court gave sentencing guidelines with regard to mitigation before sentencing in murder cases at paragraph 71 as;
a.
Age of the offender,
b.
Being a first offender,
c.
Whether the offender pleaded guilty,
d.
Character and record of the offender,
e.
Commission of the offence in response to gender- based violence,
f.
Remorsefulness of the offender,
g.
Any other relevant factor.






32.
In the same case the Court in regard to the application of mitigation by the accused before sentencing held as follows:
“
It is during mitigation, after conviction and before sentencing, that the offender’s version of events may be heavy with pathos necessitating the court to consider an aspect that may have been unclear during the trial process calling for pity more that censure or in the converse impose the death penalty.”






33.
We take note that during mitigation the appellant stated that he was a first offender, he was remorseful and that his father is dependent on him and prayed for leniency.






34.
In 
Chai vs. Republic (Criminal Appeal 30 of 2020
) [2022]KECA 495 (KLR) (1 APRIL 2022) this Court, differently constituted held that the two holdings of the Supreme Court in the Muruatetu case made it very clear, and underscored the importance of receiving and considering mitigating circumstances, and also of applying applicable sentencing guidelines, even though the latter are a guide.






35.
In his ruling on sentence, the learned judge while taking note of the mitigation, observed that the appellant was a young man, filled with remorse, but pointed out that the offence was serious and only provided for one sentence, to justify the death sentence. It is apparent that the learned judge found no room to exercise his discretion despite acknowledging the plea in mitigation.






36.
We acknowledge that murder is a serious offence; and also consider the circumstances in which the offence was committed. It is not lost on us that the homicide was a result of a vicious and brutal attack involving a knife which the appellant had armed himself with. It is also clear that the attack was committed after some level of planning, where the appellant left his residence, tricked the deceased into coming out for a chat with him, he was already armed; and in our view it involved some considered level of planning; it was not a spontaneous explosion of blind rage; and we are in agreement with the trial judge that the appellant knew exactly what he wanted to do; and he accomplished his mission. Consequently, we find that the appellant’s conviction for the offence of murder was safe and we uphold the said conviction.






37.
We however take note that at the time of sentencing, death was considered as the only possible sentence for the offence of murder, so that despite considering the appellant’s plea in mitigation, he was not able to exercise his discretion judiciously. We are keenly aware of our emerging jurisprudence, courtesy of Muruatetu case (supra), that it is no longer the case that death is the mandatory sentence for murder. The respondent urges us that even as we review the sentence, that we impose a stiff sentence given the aggravating circumstances in this case; and guided by the principles set out by the Supreme Court in Muruatetu (supra). We are persuaded that in these circumstances, the appellant deserves to not only realise the gravity of his actions, and be kept away from the community for a long time; and in our considered view a life sentence is appropriate. We thus set aside the death sentence and substitute it with a life sentence.






38.
As regards the indeterminate nature of a life sentence, we addressed ourselves in great detail in the case of Evans Nyamari Ayako vs. R Kisumu Cr.A No 22 of 2018 that:
""… we are in agreement that an indeterminate life sentence falls afoul the provisions of Articles 27 and 28 of our Constitution purposively interpreted. We also find that there is an emerging consensus that the evolving standards of human decency and human rights to which Kenya has agreed to adhere to by virtue of Articles 2(5) and 2(6) of 
the Constitution
 that indeterminate life imprisonment is a cruel and degrading punishment which violates our constitutional values. Our conclusion is based on the consistent trend in many states towards abolition of life imprisonment or its re-definition to a term sentence…
This emerging consensus of the civilized world community, while not controlling our outcome, provides respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusion that life imprisonment is cruel and degrading treatment owing to its indefiniteness. On our part, considering this comparative jurisprudence and the prevailing socio-economic conditions in Kenya, we come to the considered conclusion that life imprisonment in Kenya does not mean the natural life of the convict. Instead, we now hold, life imprisonment translates to thirty years’ imprisonment.”
The upshot is that all factors considered in this case, a sentence of thirty (30) years imprisonment is warranted. We, therefore set aside the death sentence imposed by the High Court; and substitute thereto a prison term of thirty (30) years. We allow the appeal against the sentence, set aside the death sentence and substitute the same with a sentence of 30 years from the date of the appellant’s conviction by the High Court.

The application is supported by the grounds on its body and a supporting affidavit of Edris Omondi, sworn on 8
th
 August, 2023, together with annexures thereto. It gives the factual background to the Application as follows.
3.
The 1
st
 respondent herein sued the applicant herein in Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004: Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu and obtained a decree dated 22
nd
 August, 2006. It subsequently filed Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
: Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, which sought orders to compel the applicant, the Municipal Council of Kisumu, to satisfy the decree in the said Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004. The applicant’s position is that, by then, the Municipal Council ceased to exist and no certificate of order against government had been extracted and served in compliance with Order 29 of Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, and section 29 of the 
Government Proceedings Act
, making the execution procedure a nullity ab initio.
Thereafter, the 1
st
 respondent moved and extracted warrants against the Chief Officer, Finance Department, Kisumu County, who was not a party to the said proceedings, and neither was his office a respondent or an interested party in the proceedings. The applicant and the Chief Officer, Finance then instructed the firm of C. Obiero & Associates Advocates to replace the firm of Owiti, Otieno & Rogot Company Advocates, the 2
nd
 respondent herein, and defend the suit vide an application pending determination in the High Court, which suit was filed together with an application for notice of change of advocates.






5.
The 2
nd
 respondent opposed the application for change of advocates on the ground that they had taxed their costs in Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 115 of 2015
: Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates vs. County Government of Kisumu and demanded to be paid before they ceased representing the applicant. The High Court agreed with the 2
nd
 respondent and gave a conditional order of change of advocates, subject to the applicant paying them their advocates fees in a ruling dated 31
st
 May, 2023. This condition is the crux of the applicant’s intended appeal.






6.
The applicant strongly objects to the procedure that the 2
nd
 respondent used to obtain an order to be paid their legal fees. It contends that the advocates could have followed well known procedures in independently executing their taxed bill of costs, as the government has procedures of budgeting and processing payments upon appropriate verifications. It claimed that the impugned certificate of costs was not converted into a decree; no certificate of order against government was extracted and served;
and no judicial review was preferred by the 2
nd
 respondent. Thus, the same was “a strange bill” against the applicant.






7.
The applicant further states that the 1
st
 respondent has commenced the execution process against it and desires representation, which was denied. It also claimed that there are no orders for stay in force at the High Court thereby exposing the applicant to risk of execution being brought against it. For this reason, it was aggrieved and has filed an Appeal vide a Notice of Appeal lodged on 2
nd
 June, 2023, against part of the said ruling dated 31
st
 May, 2023. Thus, the applicant has urged that it has an arguable appeal with high chances of success and will suffer substantial loss and damage, which will render its appeal nugatory if the orders sought herein are not granted. Specifically, the applicant states that one of the main arguable grounds of appeal is the High Court’s failure to appreciate the law with regard to the right of parties to change their advocates in accordance with Order 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The applicant adds that the colossal amounts hiked by the respondents from Kshs. 6,000,000.00 to Kshs. 189,000,000.00 will be prejudicial to them and an illegal use of tax payers money; the said impugned ruling was in favour of the 2
nd
 respondent and against the applicant as it tremendously affects the applicant’s right to representation; the purported certificate of costs arising from Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 115 of 2015
; Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates vs. County Government of Kisumu, has never been brought to the attention of the County Government of Kisumu and/or the Municipal Council of Kisumu by way of certificate of order against government under Order 29 of Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 and section 21 of the 
Government Proceedings Act
, and as such, it is only known to the 2
nd
 respondent alone; and the applicant has fully complied with the provisions of Order 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules and should ordinarily be allowed to separate from its now estranged advocates who have alternative options of addressing their claims in law.






8.
The application is opposed by the 1
st
 respondent through a replying affidavit sworn by Gordon Orure Kaoko, a Director of the 1
st
 respondent, on 20
th
 September, 2023.






9.
He depones that: the said applicant’s Notice of Appeal did not comply with the mandatory provisions of the Court of Appeal Rules and neither was it served upon their advocate on record, and that the first time he came across it was in the instant application where the same was one of the annexures; the applicant’s notice of motion is missing some pages of the judgment of E.N. Maina, J, dated 30
th
 October, 2014, in Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu; the decree the applicant seeks to prevent the 1
st
 respondent from executing is now more than 17 years old, having been issued on 30
th
 March, 2006 in Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, from which there was no appeal; and orders sought in Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, were merely for enforcement of the decree issued in Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, by an order of mandamus which at the time the same was given, the court expressly found that the said decree issued was not contested.






10.
He further depones that the impugned ruling with regard to the present appeal did not deal with any question concerning the 1
st
 respondent’s execution of the decree against the applicant in Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004; 
Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu or Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Application No. 236 of 2012
; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu. Rather, the learned judge only dealt with the issue of the applicant being granted leave to appoint new advocates to replace the previous advocates. In the premise, there is no basis upon which an injunction order can be issued against the 1
st
 respondent.






11.
He also states that contrary to the applicant’s claim, the impugned ruling dated 31
st
 May, 2023 was not in favour of the 2
nd
 respondent and against the applicant. He adds that the applicant has not explained why it has refused to comply with the orders issued on 31
st
 May, 2023, requiring it to pay the taxed costs of its previous advocates before it can engage the services of any new advocates.






12.
The application is also opposed by the 2
nd
 respondent through a replying affidavit sworn by David Otieno, a practicing partner of the 2
nd
 respondent, on 25
th
 September, 2023. He also gives a detailed background to the application.






13.
He depones that: his law firm, then trading as Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates had been on the applicant’s panel, then known as the Municipal Council of Kisumu before the devolution and merger with other local authorities since 2003. During this time, he rendered legal services to the applicant in several cases including Kisumu High Court Civil Suit No. 139 of 2004; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, in which the 1
st
 respondent sued and obtained judgment for Kshs. 11,188,006.79 for work done and a sister suit Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, in which the 1
st
 respondent sought enforcement of their judgment by way of mandamus.






14.
In this regard, he states that he updated the applicant that he had successfully contested the validity of the execution proceedings by a letter dated 22
nd
 May, 2015, and advised them to take advantage of the reprieve that the favourable ruling provided and comply with the court order. He also asked the applicant to settle his fees and sent them a bill. Subsequently, the court directed the applicant to pay the principal sum, which was not disputed; and following which he received communication from the office of the County Attorney addressed to the applicant’s Chief Finance Officer, advising him to comply with the court orders. However, the applicant refused to settle genuine liabilities, refused to settle the debt as ordered by the court and also refused to pay his fees. Instead, the applicant opted to appoint another advocate in his place, with the intention of obtaining legal protection against complying with the court orders, while at the same time avoiding to settle his debt with him. For this reason, the applicant went against the most basic regulations guiding the change of legal representation and purported to file a notice of change of advocates through M/s Rodi, Orege & Company Advocates in Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
: Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, despite the fact that he was on record as their advocate.






15.
Mr. Otieno explains that M/s Rodi, Orege & Company Advocates also filed an application alongside the said notice, dated 28
th
 September, 2015, seeking leave to come on record; but which application he opposed vide a replying affidavit filed on 5
th
 October, 2015. He claims that in an attempt to get around the application and let the new law firm take over conduct of the matter without paying his fees, the applicant lied to said law firm that he had a meeting with its Chief Finance Officer whereby the issue of his fees settlement was discussed and agreed. However, he responded to the “misinformation” appropriately through a letter dated 22
nd
 October, 2015. Due to this “using and misusing advocates” and refusal by the applicant to even make a commitment to pay his fees, the application dated 28
th
 September, 2015, was argued and the court delivered a ruling dated 19
th
 November, 2015, which stated that his law firm was still on record. In addition, the court gave the applicant the opportunity to change representation subject to payment of his fees within 14 days from the date of the ruling. In default, the protective orders issued would stand vacated as they had been obtained by a counsel who was not properly on record.






16.
Thereafter, on 24
th
 November, 2015, the 2
nd
 respondent received a letter from M/s Rodi, Orege & Company Advocates seeking to know what his fees were. More importantly, the said letter asked him to promptly aid the applicant in complying with the court orders. The 2
nd
 respondent says that it promptly responded to the said letter and informed the law firm that an invoice and account details had already been provided to the applicant. Unfortunately, the applicant persisted in its refusal to pay or otherwise comply with the court orders. This forced him to institute proceedings to have his fees taxed for services rendered in Kisumu High Court Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. 236 of 2012
; Gulf Fabricators Ltd vs. Municipal Council of Kisumu, vide Misc. Civil Applicati
on No. E115 of 2015
; Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates vs. County Government of Kisumu, in which the applicant fully participated. The 2
nd
 respondent was awarded Kshs. 174, 541.88 together with interest at court rates from 24
th
 December, 2015.






17.
Mr. Otieno depones that the applicant was all along aware of the court order and did not have to wait for the 2
nd
 respondent to move to court to be forced to make payment. He also states that there is no law that requires a certificate of order against the government to be taken out before payment is made. He points out that if there was anything that would have been a challenge in making settlement of fees, the applicant should have appealed against the same or asked for a review of the ruling dated 19
th
 November, 2015. Further, if it had such a challenge, the applicant would have not asked for their account details.






18.
Mr. Otieno supported the ruling of the learned judge which he says was spot on, both in terms of the express wording of the law and the spirit and principles informing the law. Further, Mr. Otieno contends that this Court has no jurisdiction to determine the instant application and the intended appeal as the High Court ruling can only be appealed with leave of the court which was not obtained.






19.
As has emerged from the dueling submissions of counsel, the genesis of the present application is the applicant’s Notice of Motion dated 21
st
 March, 2023, in which the applicant sought leave for the following orders:
a.
Spent
b.
Spent
c.
That the firm of C. Obiero & Associates be granted leave to come on record for the respondents in place of Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates; and the annexed notice of change of advocates be deemed as duly filed after payment of requisite fees.
d.
That after hearing of this application inter parties, this court does declare the ongoing execution as statute barred, in breach of legal procedures of execution and are null and void for contravening Section 15 of the 6th Schedule of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010, Section 35 of Transition to Devolve Government Act 2012, section 15 of the 6th Schedule of Transition to Devolve Government Act 2012 and Section 12(b) of 
Intergovernmental Relations Act
.
e.
That in the alternative, this court does waive such interest to be fortified with regard to the decree dated 30
th
 March, 2006 in line with Section 4 Subsection 4 of Limitations of Actions Act 2012.
f.
That the court does make such additional orders as may be fit in the circumstance.
g.
That the costs of this application be provided for.






20.
In her ruling, the learned judge did an analysis and coined the issue for determination as: whether the firm of C. Obiero & Associates should be granted leave to come on record for the judgment debtor in place of the firm of Otieno, Ragot & Company Advocates. Her reason for dealing with that single issue alone was based on the fact that the parties made submissions on that issue only. Secondly, she explained that before determining the issue fully and satisfying herself that the said firm can be allowed to take over the conduct of this present matter on behalf of the judgment debtor, it would be premature to determine the other substantive prayers in the application.






21.
In reaching her conclusion, the learned Judge reasoned that Order 9 Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides that if a litigant wishes to change counsel after judgement, he is required to procure the consent of the outgoing counsel or have the change effected through an order of court upon filing an appropriate application. In this regard, she stated that in the present case, the outgoing advocate refused to give consent because an attempt by another law firm to get on record in their place was allowed conditional upon the advocates’ costs being settled within 14 days of the order for leave, way back in 2015, which costs have never been settled despite assessment of the same vide HC Misc. Applicati
on No. E115 of 2021
.






22.
While pointing out that the essence of Order 9 Rule 9 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 was to protect the advocates or firms from mischievous clients who wait until a judgment is delivered and then replace the advocate without notice and without their legal fees being settled, the learned Judge agreed that the applicant had a right to choice of counsel, and a right to change that counsel; but added that in the same breath, the advocate also has a right to payment of their legal fees.






23.
Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the applicant filed a Notice of Appeal dated 8
th
 June, 2023. They also filed the instant Notice of Motion dated 8
th
 August, 2023, which sought the stated prayers in paragraph (1) above.






24.
The Application was argued by way of written submissions by all parties. During the virtual hearing of the application, learned counsel Mr. Obiero appeared for the applicant, learned counsel Mr. Orengo appeared for the 1
st
 respondent and learned counsel Mr. Otieno appeared for the 2
nd
 respondent. All parties relied on their pleadings and submissions and provided oral highlights which rehashed the respective positions outlined above.






25.
The essence of the applicant’s submissions is that it has a right to be represented by an advocate of its choice upon compliance with Order 9 Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010. Therefore, its right of representation could not be determined on account of unpaid fees taxed in a different cause in which the protesting advocate has the option of extracting a certificate of order against the government and executing it in such a cause or in a judicial review as applicable to government institutions under Order 29 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 and section 21 of the 
Government Proceedings Act
. The applicant insisted that the condition of payment of fees where an advocate and his client are estranged, more so if the same can be effectively executed and administered in a different cause with its own distinct procedure, amounts to denial of justice. Finally, the applicant submitted that it has demonstrated that it has an arguable appeal; and the amounts involved of Kshs. 189,000,000.00 was erroneously calculated from a decretal sum of Kshs. 6,000,000.00, which has been challenged and if executed as intended, is likely to prejudice the applicant who wishes that his objections and applications pending in the High Court file be determined on merit.






26.
Both the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents essentially rehashed the positions taken in their written submissions which we have summarized above.






27.
We have considered the record in light of the rival pleadings and submissions. This being an application for temporary injunction, the applicant has to satisfy the twin requirements of Rule 5(2)(b) of the Court of Appeal Rules as restated in Stanley Kangethe Kinyanjui vs. Tony Ketter & 5 Others [2013] eKLR. The requirements are that the intended appeal must be arguable and secondly, that it will be rendered nugatory if the order of temporary injunction sought is not granted.






28.
Is the appeal arguable? We are aware that the threshold for arguability is very low: an applicant is only required to show that its appeal is one that ought to be argued fully before the Court. The threshold is not to demonstrate that the appeal is one with a high probability of succeeding. Differently put, an arguable appeal is one which is not frivolous.






29.
In the present case, the applicant’s appeal is against an order by the High Court requiring it to pay an advocates’ fees as a condition for it to exercise its undoubted right to change advocates. This is pursuant to Order 9 Rule 9 which provides that a party to a litigation is not permitted to change advocates after judgment has been entered except with the consent of the previous advocate on record or with the leave of the court. The couching of that rule lays evident its policy rationale:- to protect an advocate from a litigant who may choose to avoid paying legal fees by instructing another advocate. It also has an inbuilt protection for the litigant against an unreasonable advocate by allowing the court to give leave – of course, subject to the conditions that the court places. In the present case, the court, upon consideration, balanced the rights of both parties by allowing the applicant to change advocates but only conditional upon paying the advocates fees. The advocates’ fees had already been taxed. The ruling in the taxation proceedings was delivered on 11
th
 November, 2015. The applicant did not file a reference against the taxation proceedings. Thereafter, the High Court made an order that the applicant was required to settle the advocates’ fees before another advocate would be allowed to come into the litigation. That was way back on 18
th
 May, 2016. The applicant neither paid nor filed an appeal against that ruling by Chemitei, J.






30.
Given this background, this is, to be charitable, one of the rare cases where it is exceedingly difficult to see any arguable and viable grounds of appeal which will be worthy of consideration by the Court on merits. The only ground upon which the applicant hitches all its wagons that comes close to being non-frivolous is the argument that the only known procedure through which an advocate can execute against a government entity is through taxation proceedings followed by a mandamus application. While the applicant presents this process as the Holy Grail of execution by an advocate to recover fees against a government entity, there is no authority for supposing that that procedure is one legally superior to the route provided by Order 9 rule 9 which the 2
nd
 respondent chose to pursue. The point is that there are three orders by competent courts for the applicant to pay the advocates’ fees – two of of which have not been appealed. It was, thus, certainly open for the 2
nd
 respondent to utilize Order 9 rule 9 to enforce the other two orders.






31.
In any event, even if we somewhat found the appeal as preferred arguable, the applicant would have failed on the second requirement in order to obtain an injunction: there has been no demonstration that the appeal would be rendered nugatory if an injunction is not granted. While the applicant claims that failure to grant the injunction will mean that the applicant has to pay more than Ksh. 189 million of public money to the 1
st
 respondent – an assuredly hefty sum – that possibility does not, at all, follow from the ruling appealed from. The impugned ruling simply required the applicant to pay a sum of Kshs. 174, 541.88 together with interest at court rates from 24
th
 December, 2015 as a condition for the applicant’s new counsel to come on record. The High Court is yet to make a determination on the other substantive aspects of the case which is whether the 1
st
 respondent can be permitted to execute against the applicant.






32.
The applicant was, therefore, required to demonstrate that the appeal they have preferred against the impugned ruling requiring them to pay to the 2
nd
 respondent a sum of Kshs. 174, 541.88 together with interest at court rates from 24
th
 December, 2015 as a condition for the applicant’s new counsel to come on record in order to prosecute its substantive prayer to object to the execution proceedings by the 1
st
 respondent would be rendered nugatory. The applicant could only have succeeded in this regard if it had demonstrated that the 2
nd
 respondent would be unable to refund the amounts; or that the amounts in question are so colossal that they would interfere with the applicant’s public functions. The applicant failed to demonstrate either.






33.
The upshot is that the application dated 8
th
 August, 2023 is unmeritorious. It is hereby dismissed with costs to the respondents.






34.
Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
The Applicant has premised his application under the provisions of Articles 22(1), 23(1), 25(c), 27, 28, 50(2)(p)(q), 160(1) and 165(3)(b) of 
the Constitution
 2010; he was seeking a re-hearing of his life sentence on the grounds that it is indeterminate and inhumane and not in line with the decision rendered by the Court of Appeal in Mombasa Petiti
on No.97 of 2021
.






2.
The Applicant was charged and convicted for the offence of Robbery with Violence Contrary to Section 296(2) of the Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 1259 of 2009 Githunguri SRMs Court. After a full hearing he was found guilty and convicted of the offence and the sentence imposed by the Githunguri trial court was the mandatory DEATH sentence. Being aggrieved he lodged an appeal to the High Court vide HCRA No.150 of 2008 and a second appeal thereafter to the 
Court of Appeal vide COA No.363 of 2012
; both appeals were dismissed and the sentence was affirmed.






3.
The Applicant now seeks a review of the sentence to a lenient and definite sentence; at the hearing hereof, the Applicant was unrepresented and relied on his supporting affidavit which he briefly highlighted; Mr Gacharia appearing for the State was not opposed to the application but requested that the Githunguri lower court record be availed to assist this court in making its decision in determining the appropriate sentence to be considered.






Applicant’s Case


4.
The Applicant submitted that this court was seized of competent jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter under the provisions of Article 50(2)(p) and (q) of 
the Constitution
 2010.






5.
The Applicant had been sentenced to a mandatory sentence as prescribed by law without due consideration of mitigation or the unique facts and circumstances of his case; he prayed to be granted a definite and lenient sentence; and also prayed that the period spent in remand be taken into consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.








Issues For Determination


6.
After hearing the Applicants submissions this court framed the following issues for determination which were;
i.
Whether this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues of re-sentencing and
ii.
Whether the applicant is entitled to benefit from the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code
Analysis
Whether this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues of review of sentence






7.
Upon perusal of the court record it is noted that having exhausted all the avenues of appeal the applicant had filed a Constitutional Petiti
on No 58 of 2018
 in the High Court Mombasa in which he sought a review of his sentence. The file was transferred to Nairobi and given Constitutional Petiti
on No. 371 of 2018
 and the Honourable Judge Ngeenye sitting in Nairobi on the 5
th
 March, 2019 directed that the file be remitted to Githunguri Law Courts for re-sentencing;






8.
On the 15/05/2019 the Githunguri court after hearing his mitigation resentenced the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment; the applicant not being satisfied made another attempt to revise the sentence in the Kiambu High Court which application was struck out on 30/06/2022.






9.
The Applicant instead of filing a Petition seeking the authority of this court to uphold his rights that may have been infringed upon opted to file an application for review.






10.
This court can only exercise its powers of revision in cases of proceedings from subordinate courts. This court has no jurisdiction to review a sentence already reviewed by a court of concurrent jurisdiction.






11.
In the circumstances the application is found to be improperly before this court and also found to be incompetent;








Findings And Determination


12.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the application.
ii.
The application for review of sentence is found to be incompetent and it is hereby struck out.




Orders accordingly.

Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the judgement of the High Court of Kenya at Kakamega (Majanja, J.) dated 4th April, 2018 in HCCRA No. 15 of 2014)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant, Nelson Kivisha, was convicted by the magistrate’s court at Vihiga of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment as the child victim was 13 years old. His appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful, as the learned Judge found that there was sufficient evidence to prove the ingredients of the charge, and that the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment was the statutory minimum sentence provided for the offence. The appellant, who was dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, preferred this  second appeal.






2.
The facts leading to the appellant’s arrest and conviction as per the concurrent findings of the two lower courts, were that the child, who testified on oath after voire dire examination, was in class 5. On the material day, one EM (EM), who was the appellant’s co-accused, took the child to the junction at (Particulars withheld) where they met with the appellant. EM left the child with the appellant saying she was going to buy bamba (credit for airtime), but she did not come back. The appellant then told the child that EM had gone ahead on a motor-bike. He took the child to his house and locked the door from inside. The child remained in the house from Tuesday to Saturday during which time, the appellant had sex with her on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. When the child resisted on Friday and Saturday, he chased her away, so she slept in the appellant’s mother’s house on Saturday and Sunday, then went to her aunt’s place, from where she was collected by her mother. The matter was reported to the police and the child was taken to Vihiga District Hospital where she was examined by a clinical officer who filled a P3 Form. The clinical officer, noted on the P3 Form that the child had a lot of painful discomfort on examination of her genitalia, and that    although she had no tears, she had a whitish discharge from her vagina which had no foul smell.






3.
In his defence, the appellant gave a sworn statement explaining how he was arrested from his house and taken to Chavakali Patrol Base, and asked whether he knew the child and he said he did not. He claimed that he was forced to admit that he knew her, but he refused and he was subsequently charged together with a woman he did not know.






4.
In support of his appeal, the appellant filed a memorandum of appeal and written submissions, in which he faulted the Judge of the first appellate court for failing to properly reconsider the evidence that was adduced before the trial court, failing to find that the identification evidence was not sufficient, and that penile penetration was not proved. The appellant further faulted the learned Judge for failing to note that the evidence was full of contradictions and inconsistencies, and that essential witnesses were not summoned. Finally, he complained that his mitigating factors were not considered. Relying on Philip Maingi & 5 Others    –vs- DPP & Another; and Edwin Wachira & Another Mombasa High Court Petiti
on No. 97 of 2021
; the appellant argued that    the court had the powers to consider a sentence lower than the minimum 20 years’ sentence provided under Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






5.
The respondent opposed the appeal through written submissions that were duly prepared by Chala Kasyoka, a Prosecution counsel in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. On the appellant’s complaint that the court did not record the language that was used during the proceedings, the respondent submitted that the issue was not open for consideration by this Court, as it was being raised for the first time in this second appeal. In addition, the respondent submitted that from the nature of the appellant’s cross-examination of witnesses, his defence and submissions before the High Court, it was apparent that he understood the charges against him and that in any case the record indicated that there was an officer one Mberesia who served the dual role of clerk and interpreter, and the languages used was English and Kiswahili. The respondent relied on Francis Macharia Gichangi & 3 Others –vs- Republic, (2007) eKLR.






6.
On the issue of identification, the respondent submitted that the appellant was identified by way of recognition and not identification. In addition, the minor was in the company of the appellant for several days, and she therefore became well acquainted with him such as to be able to recognize him.






7.
As regards the failure to call the arresting officer to testify, the respondent submitted that there was no dispute regarding the appellant’s arrest, and that in any case the evidence of the child was sufficient and convincing, and there was no need for the prosecution to call more witnesses. The respondent referred to Section 143 of the 
Evidence Act
, and 
Julius Kalewa Mutunga vs Republic Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 2005
 for the proposition that there is no particular number of witnesses required for proof of any fact; that it was within the discretion of the prosecution to decide whether a witness should be called; and that as an appellate Court, this Court could only interfere if it is shown that in excluding the witness, the prosecution was influenced by some ulterior motive.






8.
On the issue of penetration, it was submitted that the same was proved to the required standard notwithstanding the    inadequacy of the medical evidence. Boaz Nyanoti Samuel vs Republic 2022 eKLR was cited for the proposition that medical evidence is not the only evidence that can prove a sexual offence. It was contended that, in any case, the medical evidence that was produced in court by the clinical officer was corroborative in nature, supporting the oral evidence of the complainant, as the doctor noted that the hymen was broken and the complainant had painful discomfort during the vaginal examination.






9.
On the alleged contradictions touching on the apparent age of the complainant, it was submitted that this did not shake the prosecution evidence as the clinic card produced confirmed that the complainant was born on the 22
nd
 January, 1999, and that she was therefore 13 years old.






10.
It was submitted that the charge sheet had no error, as the appellant was charged and convicted under Section 8 (1) as read with 8 (3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, and the error by the learned Judge of the High Court in referring to Section 8 (1) as read with 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 was curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






11.
On the minimum sentence meted out to him of 20 years’ imprisonment, the respondent took note of Maingi & 5 Others vs Director of Public Prosecutions & Another (supra), and the Court of Appeal decision in Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs Republic as well as Julius Kitsao Manyeso vs Republic, but referred to the Judiciary Sentencing Guidelines gazetted on 1
st
 September, 2023 where it was stated that the court is bound by the mandatory and minimum sentences provided under the law and therefore argued that until the Supreme Court decided the issue to the contrary, the court had to adhere to the legislative framework and therefore the courts were still bound by the mandatory minimum sentence. The respondent therefore urged the court to dismiss the appellant’s appeal on both conviction and sentence and uphold the sentence of 20 years.






12.
This being a second appeal, this court is restricted under Section 361(1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code to considering matters of law only. As stated by this Court in Stephen M’Irungi & Another vs Republic 1982 – 88 1KAR 360:
“
Where a right of appeal is confined to questions of law only, an appellate court has loyalty to accept the findings of fact of the lower court(s) and resist the temptation to treat findings of fact      as holdings of law or mixed finding of fact and law, and, it should not interfere with the decisions of the trial or first appellate court unless it is apparent that, on the evidence, no reasonable tribunal could have reached that conclusion, which would be the same as holding the decision is bad in law.""






13.
With the above caution in mind, we have considered the record, the grounds of appeal and the submissions of both parties. The main issues that we discern for our determination are: whether the appellant’s rights to a fair trial were infringed; whether the two lower courts were right in finding the elements of the charge of defilement proved; and whether this Court should interfere with the sentence that was imposed on the appellant.






14.
We start our analysis with the appellants’ complaint that his rights to a fair trial were breached. He cited Article 25(c) and 50(2) of 
the Constitution
, but it is evident from his submissions that his specific grievance was the trial magistrate’s alleged failure to indicate the language that was used during the trial. A perusal of the trial court proceedings confirms this omission. Nevertheless, the appellant did not complain that he did not understand the language used by the court. A perusal of the trial court’s proceedings indicates that on 4
th
 May, 2012 when the amended charges were read to him,    the appellant responded in Kiswahili language. Moreover, the trial proceeded to the end and the record does not show the appellant complaining at any time that he did not understand the language that was being used by the court, or that he was not able to follow the proceedings.






15.
During the trial, the appellant cross-examined the witnesses and also gave his defence. Although the language is not indicated, it is evident that the appellant actively participated in the proceedings, which is a clear indication that he was comfortable with, and understood the language that was being used by the court. Moreover, during the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, it was indicated that there was English/Kiswahili translation and the appellant did not complain nor did he raise any issue regarding the language used or the violation of his rights in that regard either before the trial court or the High Court. We agree with the respondent that it is not open to the appellant at this second appellate stage to raise for the first time, any issue regarding violation of his rights, and this ground therefore fails.






16.
As regards an alleged defect in the charge or judgment, according to the charge sheet the appellant was charged with defilement    contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The particulars given on the charge sheet were clear, that the child was 13 years old. However, as per the judgment of the trial magistrate the appellant was indicated as having been charged with defilement under Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, and he was convicted and sentenced to serve 20 years’ imprisonment. Similarly, the learned Judge of the High Court on first appeal noted that the appellant was charged and convicted of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) and 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The Judge in dismissing the appeal, noted that the child was 13 years old and that the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment is the statutory minimum under Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






17.
Section 8 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, states as follows:
1.
A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.
2.
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.
3.
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years.
4.
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of sixteen and eighteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than fifteen years.






18.
It is evident that the trial magistrate made a mistake in stating that the appellant was charged with defilement under Section 8(1) and 8(4) of the Sexual Offences’ Act, as the charge sheet stated the Section under which the appellant was charged as Section 8(1) and 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. Section 8(4) is the penalty Section where the child is aged between sixteen and eighteen years. The particulars of the charge against the appellant indicated the age of the child as 13 years, which falls under Section 8(3) and not 8(4).






19.
It is evident that both the trial magistrate and the learned Judge of the High Court had Section 8(3) in mind as this is the one that provides the minimum sentence of 20 years for defilement of a 13- year-old child. We find that there was no defect in the charge sheet, but there was an error in the judgments arising from Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 indicated in the judgments of both the trial magistrate and the High Court Judge, and this error originated from a typographical error on the judgment of the trial magistrate. This error was not prejudicial to the appellant as the particulars of the    charge were clear that he was alleged to have defiled a 13-year-old child, and he was evidently given a sentence falling under Section 8(3) which was the right Section under which he was charged. Moreover, the error on the judgment was curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and, therefore, nothing turns on this ground.






20.
Under Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the prosecution is required to establish three elements in order to prove the offence of defilement, namely; proof that the complainant was a child that is under 18 years old; proof of penetration as defined in the 
Sexual Offences Act
, and positive identification of the accused person as the person who caused the penetration.






21.
Regarding the issue of age, the appellant contended that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses on the complainant’s age was contradictory. He pointed out that the clinical officer stated that the health card indicated that the complainant was born on 22/1/1999, whilst the complainant's mother in her evidence stated that the complainant was born on 22/1/2009. In rebuttal, the respondent submitted that the alleged contradiction does not shake the    prosecution's evidence as the clinic card produced confirmed that the complainant was born on the 22nd January, 1999.






22.
We note that the complainant testified that she was 13 years old and was in class 5 at the time of the incident. This was corroborated by the evidence of her mother, and that of her father. The Clinical Officer, also produced the child health card, and the P3 Form which indicated that the complainant was 13 years old at the time of the incident. The year of 2009 which the complainant’s mother gave was obviously a mistake as it would have placed the complainant’s age at three years which was clearly not the position, given that the child was in class 5. We are satisfied that for the purpose of Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 the complainant was a child and we agree with the learned Judge of the High Court that:
“
There is no doubt that PW1 was below 18 years old and therefore a child hence the offence of defilement was committed….’’






23.
On the element of penetration, it is apparent that the medical evidence was not conclusive because although the absence of the hymen was noted. there were no bruises or injuries on the vagina, or the labia, or adjacent areas, nor was there any semen noted. It is clear that the absence of hymen alone is not conclusive proof of    penetration. However, the complainant testified that the appellant took her to his house and defiled her on three consecutive nights, before she sought refuge in his mother’s house for two nights, then she went to her aunt’s house. When she was taken to the hospital about 6 days after the defilement, the Clinical Officer who examined her noted that she had painful discomfort on vaginal examination, even though there were no bruises. He also noted a whitish discharge from her vagina. From his examination, he concluded that there was penile penetration.






24.
This Court, in 
Muhendu v Republic (Criminal Appeal 60 of 2018
) [2024] KECA 322 (KLR) (22 March 2024) (Judgment), agreed with the observations made by the Supreme Court of Uganda in Bassita vs. Uganda
 S. C. Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1995
 with regard to proof of penetration that:
“
The act of sexual intercourse or penetration may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Usually, the sexual intercourse is proved by the victim’s evidence and corroborated by medical evidence or other evidence. Though desirable it is not a hard and fast rule that the victim’s evidence and medical evidence must always be adduced in every case of defilement to prove sexual intercourse or penetration. Whatever evidence the prosecution may wish to adduce, to prove its case, such evidence must be such that is sufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.”






25.
There is no cause to fault the learned Judge’s finding that the medical evidence analyzed, together with the evidence of the complainant established beyond any reasonable doubt, that the appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant, thereby defiling her. Moreover, under the proviso to Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, in sexual offences, the court can convict on the evidence of the complainant alone, provided it is satisfied that the complainant’s evidence is truthful.






26.
On the identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence, the complainant testified that the appellant locked her in the house for three days during which period he defiled her daily. On the 4
th
 day when the complainant refused to have sex with him because of pain, the appellant chased her out of his house at night. She stated that she stayed with the appellants' mother for two days before she was told to go home. When the appellant's mother was confronted about the incident, she did not deny that the complainant had been in her home, but confirmed to the complainant’s mother what the complainant had stated, that she had asked the complainant to go back home.






27.
The complainant was able to identify the appellant by way of recognition, as the perpetrator of the offence, as she had been with him in his house for three days. The appellant was, therefore, not a stranger to her but a person he had come to know. As stated in Anjononi and Others vs. The Republic [1980] KLR: “Recognition of an assailant is more satisfactory, more assuring, and more reliable than identification of a stranger.” We are, therefore, in agreement with the concurrent finding of both the trial court and the 1
st
 appellate court, that, indeed, the appellant was properly identified as the perpetrator of the offence.






28.
On whether there were material contradictions in the prosecution evidence, the question is whether the alleged contradictions were so material as to undermine the core evidence relied upon. The test in this regard is that set by the Court in Sigei v. Republic [2023] KECA 154 (KLR) that:
“
In assessing the impact of contradictory statements or discrepancies on the prosecution’s case, our understanding is that firstly, for contradictions to be fatal, it must relate to material facts. Secondly, such contradictions must concern substantial matters in the case. Thirdly, such contradictions must deal with the real substance of the case.”






29.
Similarly, in Richard Munene vs. Republic [2018] eKLR the Court stated that:
“
It is a settled principle of law, however, that it is not every trifling contradiction or inconsistency in the evidence of the prosecution witness that will be fatal to its case. It is only when such inconsistencies or contradictions are substantial and fundamental to the main issues in question and thus necessarily creates some doubt in the mind of the trial court that an accused person will be entitled to benefit from it.”






30.
There is nothing on the record to suggest that the evidence led by the prosecution was plagued with grave contradictions. The only contradiction was with regard to the complainant’s date of birth, and this as we have endeavored to demonstrate above was not a material contradiction, but a slip of the tongue which was corrected by other credible evidence. Apart from raising this as a ground of appeal, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that there were any contradictions that were fundamental, or that materially affected the prosecution evidence as to justify an acquittal on that ground.






31.
Regarding the contention that the sentence meted out on the appellant was harsh and excessive, under Section 361(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, severity of sentence is a matter of fact which is outside the remit of this Court. The sentence imposed on    the appellant was the minimum sentence prescribed under Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, which is the penal Section under which the appellant was charged. The complainant was 13 years old, which explains why the trial magistrate sentenced the appellant to 20 years’ imprisonment, which is the minimum sentence provided for under Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, for the age bracket of victims who are 12 years to 15 years old. Contrary to the appellant’s contention that his mitigating factors were not considered, the record shows that the trial magistrate considered his mitigation. The learned Judge of the first appellate court also considered the appellant’s sentence, but declined to interfere with the sentence that was imposed by the trial court, as it was the minimum sentence provided under the law.






32.
This Court sitting at Nyeri in Francis Nkunja Tharamba vs.    Republic [2012] eKLR held as follows:
“
…sentencing is a discretionary act of the trial court even though the limits such as the maximum sentences and in some cases the minimum sentences are prescribed by law, nonetheless, as to the exact sentence to be pronounced upon a convicted person, the trial court has in most criminal cases, the discretion to decide. That being the case, in law, the appellate court should not intervene in such an exercise of discretion by an inferior court unless,      it is demonstrated to it that the trial court has not exercised that discretion properly in that it has failed to consider matters it should have considered or that it has considered matters it should not have considered or that looking at the entire decision, it is plainly wrong. These are the situations in law where the appellate court can intervene in the trial court’s exercise of discretionary power such as that of sentencing. The next principle that the appellate court should adhere to when considering an appeal on sentence is that when the sentence is lawful, the appellate court should not interfere.”






33.
Nothing was laid before this Court to show that the trial court failed to properly exercise its discretion in sentencing, or that there was justification for the first appellate court to intervene, but that it failed to do so. Moreover, in his appeal to the High Court, the appellant did not raise any grounds challenging the sentence and has raised the issue for the first time in this appeal. In that regard his appeal is on all fours with the recent Supreme Court decision in 
Republic v Mwangi; Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 others (Amicus Curiae) (Petition E018 of 2023
) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR); in which the Supreme Court held that since the appellant failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the sentence as a ground of appeal in the High Court, he was precluded    from raising the issue on appeal before the Court of Appeal. The appeal on the sentence therefore fails.






34.
The appellant requested that the period that he was in remand between the time of his arrest and the time of conviction be taken into consideration in computing his sentence. This has not been opposed by the respondent. The appellant was arrested on 21
st
 April, 2012 and has been in custody since then. In accordance with Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the time spent in custody by the appellant ought to be considered in computing his sentence. Accordingly, we order that the appellant’s sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment be computed to commence on 21
st
 April 2012 which was the date that he was first brought to court, and remanded in custody, where he remained throughout his trial.

          (An appeal from the judgment of the Environment and Land Court at Kakamega (Matheka, J.) dated 11th July 2018 in In original ELC Case No. 219 of 2016 (Judicial Review Application No. 34 of 2012)
        
      






Judgment










1.
A brief account of the history of this protracted litigation as we gather it from the record is necessary so as to properly contextualize and determine the issues urged by the parties in this appeal in support of their respective positions.






2.
Samson Angolo Timothy Osiru (the appellant herein), filed a suit against one, Makutsa Pete, at the Resident Magistrate’s Court at Vihiga being Miscellaneous Civil Suit No. 70 of 1998. The dispute related to ownership of land parcels numbers Bunyore/ Ebu
sikhale/2153
, 2154 and 2209. The court referred the dispute to the Luanda Dispute Land Tribunal for determination. The Tribunal heard the dispute of 21
st
 September 1998 and rendered its award on 26
th
 October 1998.






3.
We have read the tribunal’s proceedings. We note that the last page of the proceedings and the award is illegible. However, from the affidavits on record, particularly the 1
st
 respondent’s affidavit dated 23
rd
 April 2012 and the appellant’s own affidavit filed in Civil Suit No. 70 of 1998 on 11
th
 April 2012, it is clear the award was that land parcel numbers 2153, 2154 and 2209 be transferred to the appellant. On 4
th
 May 2011, the said award was adopted as an order of the court in the above suit.






4.
Fortified by the said award, by an application dated 6
th
 July 2012, the appellant applied for an order that the executive officer of the Vihiga Resident Magistrate’s Court be authorized to sign land transfer documents transferring the said titles in his favour. Upon learning about the said proceedings, Paresh Narandash Sedan (the 1
st
 respondent), filed an application dated 20
th
 May 2012 at the Kakamega High Court being Judicial Review Applicati
on No. 34 of 2012
 seeking leave to commence judicial review proceedings against The Land Registrar, Vihiga and the Resident Magistrate, Vihiga. The appellant was named as an interested party in the said proceedings.






5.
Specifically, the 1
st
 respondent sought leave to apply for judicial review orders of prohibition so as to prohibit the Principal Magistrate, Vihiga Law Courts, or any other magistrate, from authorizing the court’s executive officer to sign transfer documents transferring the said titles to appellant. He also sought leave to apply for the writ of mandamus compelling the Land Registrar, Vihiga to cancel entries of court decrees issued in Civil Suit No. 70 of 1998 registered in the register of titles for parcels numbers 2153 and 2154. In addition, he prayed for an order that the leave sought, if granted, operates as stay of proceedings or other transactions concerning the said parcels of land pending determination of the substantive application or further orders of the court. Lastly, he prayed for the costs of the application to follow the cause.






6.
The grounds in support of the 1
st
 respondent’s aforesaid application were:- (a) He was the registered proprietor of the said parcels of land. (b) The Luanda Division Land Disputes Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain a dispute in respect of land registered under the Registered 
Land Act
. (c) That the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining the said dispute. (d) He had developments on the two parcels, which he had been in occupation since 2004. (e) He only learnt about the litigation relating to the two parcels of land on 17
th
 April 2012 after he obtained copies of the titles from the Lands Registry showing restrictions registered against the titles pursuant to a decree issued in Vihiga Civil Applicati
on No. 70 of 1998
. (f) He also learnt that the appellant had filed an application in the said case seeking an order authorizing the court’s executive officer to sign transfer documents in respect of the said parcels of land to his name.






7.
The 1
st
 respondent was granted leave on 23
rd
 March 2012 which was to operate as stay of the transactions relating to the said parcels of land. The 1
st
 respondent filed the substantive motion dated 2
nd
 May 2012 on 14
th
 May 2012 seeking orders of prohibition and mandamus as prayed in the leave application. The grounds in support of the substantive motion are essentially similar to the grounds in support of the application seeking leave, therefore it will add no value to rehash them here.






8.
In opposition to the application, the appellant filed a replying affidavit dated 6
th
 August 2012. Its key highlights are that there was a dispute between himself and one Makutsa Pete over LR. No. West Bunyore/Ebusikhale/464 which was adjudicated by the area chief who directed the said Makutsa Pete to surrender the said land to him. That the said Mr. Pete declined to surrender the land as directed, which prompted him to file civil suit number 21 of 1994 seeking orders that the said Mr. Pete held the said land in trust for him since the land belonged to his father. That it is the said land that was subdivided into the parcels of land now the subject of these proceedings and his application seeking to restrain Mr. Pete from subdividing the said land was dismissed.






9.
He also averred that the Luanda Division Land Disputes Tribunal awarded the said parcels to him and any aggrieved party had 30 days as per the law to challenge the said decision. Since no appeal was filed against the said decision, the award was adopted by the court in Miscellaneous application number 70 of 1998 on 9
th
 February 1999.






10.
The 4
th
 respondent, who was enjoined into the proceedings pursuant to his application dated 21
st
 February 2018, claimed that he was the registered proprietor of land parcel number Bunyore/Ebusikhale/ 2209 which he lawfully purchased and had been registered in his name and that, therefore, he was the absolute proprietor of the said land.






11.
In the impugned judgment dated 11
th
 July 2018, the learned judge held that the Luanda Division Land Disputes Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to act as it did and, therefore, it exceeded its jurisdiction by purporting to determine ownership dispute of land registered under the Registered 
Land Act
 (repealed) in violation of section 3 (1) of the Land Disputes Tribunal Act (repealed). Accordingly, the learned judge allowed the application and issued an order prohibiting the Principal Magistrate or any other magistrate at Vihiga Court from granting an order authorizing the Executive Officer of the court to sign the transfer of land documents transferring the said land parcels to the appellant.






12.
The learned Judge also issued an order of mandamus compelling the Land Registrar, Vihiga to cancel the entry of the decrees issued in Vihiga Miscellaneous Civil Applicati
on No. 70 of 1998
 in the Register of the above two parcels of land. Lastly, the learned Judge made no order as to costs.






13.
In this appeal, the appellant seeks to overturn the above finding. In his memorandum of appeal dated 18
th
 June 2019, the appellant cited 11 grounds of appeal, some of which are repetitive. The gist of his grounds are that the learned Judge erred by:- (a) Ignoring the provisions of Order 21 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules. (b) Ignoring his evidence and submissions; (c) Failing to call for copies of the title. (c) Rendering a judgment that offended Order 21 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules; (d) Misconstruing section 3 (1) of the Land Disputes Tribunal Act and thereby arriving at the wrong finding that the tribunal had no jurisdiction. (e) Compelling the Land Registrar, Vihiga to cancel the decrees in the register of the said parcels of land contrary to the evidence. (g) Failure to appreciate the facts.






14.
In his submissions, the appellant argued that the learned Judge failed to set out a concise statement of the case, points for determination, the decision thereon and reasons for the decision. He maintained that the judgment offends Order 21 Rules 4 and 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules. It was his case that the learned Judge failed to appreciate the powers of the tribunal under section 3 (2) of the Land Disputes Tribunal Act. He argued that the learned judge erred in failing to call for copies of the titles, and by ignoring his replying affidavit, submissions and his evidence.






15.
The appellant also submitted that the learned Judge misinterpreted section 3 (1) of the Land Disputes Tribunal Act and, as a result, held that the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the parcels of land and in the process failed to consider the history of the dispute and the fraudulent transfer of the said titles. He maintained that the tribunal’s decision could only be challenged by way of an appeal. Lastly, he argued that the orders of mandamus and prohibition were unmerited since there was no wrong committed by the Principal Magistrate.






16.
The 1
st
 respondent did not attend court during the virtual hearing of the appeal. However, his written submissions dated 14
th
 September 2023 in opposition to the appeal are on record. He argued that judicial review orders are discretionary in nature and cited Madan JA in United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs. East African Underwriters (Kenya) Ltd [1985] E.A. and Shah vs. Mbogo [1968] E.A. 93 in support of the holding, that an appellate court will not interfere with exercise of a trial court’s discretion except in limited circumstances such as if there is proven misdirection in law or misapprehension of facts, or if the court took into account irrelevant considerations, or failed to take into account relevant considerations, or if the decision is plainly wrong. He contended that there is nothing to show that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion.






17.
The 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents did not file submissions nor did they attend the hearing of this appeal despite being served.






18.
The 4
th
 respondent argued that he was not served with the record of appeal, yet he was an interested party in the proceedings before the trial court. He argued that the appeal does not raise any triable issues, that the appellant failed to disclose that he was in occupation of parcel number 2209 which he lawfully purchased in 2005, and is jointly registered in his name and his wife. He maintained that the trial Judge considered all the facts and arrived at the correct decision, therefore urged this Court to uphold the trial court’s decision and dismiss this appeal.






19.
We have considered the grounds of appeal, the parties’ submissions, the authorities cited and the impugned judgment. In our view, this appeal will stand or fall on one germane issue, which is, whether the Luanda Division Land Disputes Tribunal acted “without jurisdiction” or “exceeded its powers.” The term “acting without jurisdiction” or “exceeding its powers” in the context of administrative law requires little by way of elucidation. The following statement by Lord Steyn in Lesotho Highlands Development Authority vs. Impregilo SpA {2005} UKHL 43 para 24 says it all:-
“
But the issue was whether the tribunal “exceeded its powers”…this required the courts… to address the question whether the tribunal purported to exercise a power which it did not have or whether it erroneously exercised a power that it did have…”






20.
The exercise of statutory power is only legitimate where lawful. A tribunal may only act within the powers lawfully conferred upon it by the enabling statute. The objective is to ensure that the statutory body remains within the area assigned to it by Parliament. A decision which falls outside that area can, therefore, be described, interchangeably, as: a decision to which no reasonable decision- maker could have come; or a decision which was not reasonably open in the circumstances.






21.
Pivotal to the answer to the issue under consideration is to find out the jurisdiction of the Luanda Land Disputes Tribunal. The relevant provision is section 3 (1) of the Land Disputes Tribunal Act (repealed) which provided as follows:-
3. (1)
Subject to this Act, all cases of a civil nature involving a dispute as to -
a.
the division of, or the determination of boundaries to land, including land held in common;
b.
a claim to occupy or work land; or
c.
trespass to land.






22.
The short title to the above section reads “limitation of jurisdiction,” clearly signifying Parliament’s intention as far as the jurisdiction of the tribunal is concerned. The jurisdiction conferred to the tribunal under the above section is limited to the matters specified therein. The tribunal has no power to entertain a dispute that falls outside the purview of the above section. The dispute before the tribunal had nothing to do with any of the matters listed in the above provision. The dispute before the tribunal related to ownership of the parcels of land in question. As is evidenced by the copies of the titles for the three parcels of land, the titles were all registered under the Registered 
Land Act
 (repealed). The 1
st
 respondent is the registered absolute proprietor of Land Reference numbers Bunyore/Ebu
sikhale/2153
 and 2154 while the 4
th
 respondent is the registered proprietor of LR No. 2209. The tribunal acted ultra vires its statutory mandate by purporting to entertain a dispute that clearly fell outside its statutory mandate.






23.
The tribunal committed a fatal “Jurisdictional error.” As was held in Craig vs. South Australia (1995) HCA 58 :-
“Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports to act wholly or partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in the sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which wholly or partly lies outside the theoretical limits of its functions and powers.”






24.
The proceedings and the ensuing award was ultra vires the tribunal’s statutory mandate. Therefore, its decision was null and void ab initio. Accordingly, we find no reason to fault the learned judge for issuing an order prohibiting the Principal Magistrate or any other magistrate at Vihiga Court from granting an order authorizing the Executive Officer of the court to sign the transfer of land documents transferring the said land parcels to the appellant. We also find no reason to fault the learned judge for issuing an order of mandamus compelling the Land Registrar, Vihiga to cancel the entry of the decrees issued in Vihiga Miscellaneous Civil Applicati
on No. 70 of 1998
 in the register of the aforesaid parcels of land.






25.
It is also important to mention that Miscellaneous Civil Suit No. 70 of 1998 which was referred to the tribunal involved the appellant and one Makutsa Pete. The 1
st
 and 4
th
 respondents who are the registered proprietors of the suit properties were not parties in the said proceedings. Therefore, it was a grave misdirection for the tribunal to entertain a dispute, and issue an award that affected parcels of land registered in the names of persons who were not parties to the dispute before it.






26.
In conclusion, we find that this appeal is devoid of merit. Accordingly, we uphold the judgment of the ELC delivered on 11
th
 July 2018 (Matheka J.) in original Kakamega Environment and Land Court No. 219 of 2016 (Judicial Review Applicati
on No. 34 of 2012
). The appellant shall pay to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents the costs of this appeal.

Judgment










Background


1.
The Applicant filed a Chamber Summons dated 19
th
 June, 2024 under the provisions of Rules 4 & 9 of the Arbitration Rules and Section 36 of the 
Arbitration Act
 and all other enabling provisions of the Law, for orders that;
a.
The Arbitral Award by the Sole Arbitrator, Shako Florence Karimi Gakungi [Florence Shako] dated 18
th
 June, 2024 be recognized as binding and be enforceable between the parties herein and a decree be issued in accordance therewith.
b.
The costs of this Application be provided for.






2.
The application was served on the Respondent and at the date set down for hearing no objection or appeal had been preferred against the Final Award;






3.
The Applicant in canvassing the application relied on the Supporting Affidavit made by Peter Manyonge Wanyama and the certified copy of the Final Award annexed thereto; hereunder is a summary of the Applicant’s claim;








Applicants Case


4.
The Application was supported by the sworn Affidavit of Peter Manyonge Wanyama who stated that he was competent to swear the affidavit.






5.
The dispute between the parties arose from an Advocate- Client fee Agreement dated 1
st
 January, 2016 made with the Respondent to provide legal services in Nairobi Constitutional Petiti
on No.418 of 2015
 for an agreed sum of Kshs.4,000,000/-






6.
The Applicant provided the legal services as per the Agreement resulting in the dismissal of the Petition; Respondent failed to uphold its part of the bargain.






7.
The Arbitrator Florence Shako was appointed as the sole arbitrator in the matter and she delivered the Award in terms of the Final Award on 18
th
 June, 2024 (marked ‘PMW5’);






8.
The Respondent has not taken any steps to set aside the Final Award within the statutory period of 30 days which time has since lapsed;






9.
The Applicant prayed that the Final Award be recognized as binding and enforceable as a judgment of this Honourable Court.








Issues for Determination


10.
After reading the Application, the Supporting Affidavit and perusing the Annexures this court has framed only one issue for determination;
i.
Whether the Applicant has made out a case for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award as a judgment of the court;








Analysis


11.
Being that the Arbitral process is a consensus, voluntary procedure through which parties choose to resolve their dispute; the court can only intervene in that process as set out under Section 10 of the 
Arbitration Act
 which provides that:
“
Extent of court intervention
Except as provided in this Act, no court shall intervene in matters governed by this Act.”






12.
Section 32A of 
Arbitration Act
 states:
“
Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitral award is final and binding upon the parties to it, and no recourse is available against the award otherwise than in the manner provided by this Act.”






13.
In Prof. Lawrence Gumbe & Another vs. Honourable Mwai Kibaki & Others, High Court Miscellaneous No. 1025 Of 2004, the Court held that:
“
Our Section 10 is based on the United Nations Model Law on arbitration and all countries who have ratified it recognize and enforce the autonomy of the arbitral process. Courts of law can only intervene in the specific areas stipulated in the Act and in most cases that intervention is usually supportive and not obstructive or usurpation-oriented...”






14.
Under section 32(A) of the Act an arbitral award is final and binding upon the parties and no recourse is available against the award otherwise than in the manner provided by the Act.






15.
The High Court under Section 36 of the Act has the power to recognize and enforce domestic arbitral award on the following terms:
“
36
(1)
A domestic arbitral award, shall be recognized as binding and, upon application in writing to the High Court, shall be enforced subject to this section and Section 37
(2)
…
(3)
Unless the High Court otherwise orders, the party relying on an arbitral award or applying for its enforcement must furnish
(a)
the original arbitral award or a duly certified copy of it; and
(b)
the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy of it.”






16.
The Applicant has annexed to the Chamber Summons a certified copy of the Final Arbitral Award (‘Annexure PMW5’). There were no grounds presented to this court by the Respondent as provided by Section 37(1) of the 
Arbitration Act
 that would have vitiated the Final Award; having perused the documents presented and after satisfying itself that the necessary provisions of the law had been complied with this court is satisfied that there are no anomalies in the Final Award that may lead this court to refuse to recognize it as binding.






17.
In the absence of any application to set aside the award under the listed grounds for non-recognition or any other challenge or any preferred appeal, this court finds that the Applicant has satisfied the conditions precedent and finds the application to be merited.








Findings and Determination


18.
In light of the foregoing this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds the application to be merited and it is hereby allowed;
ii.
The Final Award dated the 18
th
 June, 2024 and delivered by the Florence Shako the Sole Arbitrator, be and is hereby recognized as binding and adopted as a judgment of this Honourable Court.
iii.
Judgment be and is hereby entered in terms of the Final Award dated the 18
th
 June, 2024 by the Arbitrator Florence Shako.
iv.
The Respondent shall bear the costs of this application.
Orders accordingly.

Urbanus Kioko t/a Urbanus K & Associates Advocates


 


Applicant




and




Trident Insurance Company Ltd


 


Respondent










Judgment










Background


1.
Before court is the Notice of Motion dated 9
th
 March, 2024 and brought under Section 51(2) of the 
Advocates Act
 (CAP 16). Paragraph 7 of the Advocates Remuneration Order and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules and all other enabling provisions of the Law; The Applicant sought for the following orders:-
a.
That the Honorable Court be pleased to enter Judgment in favor of the Applicant herein, in the sum of Kshs. 80,000/- as appears on the Certificate of Taxation dated 15/01/2024 with interest at 14% per annum from 28/02/2022 until payment in full.
b.
That the costs of the application be borne by the Respondent.






2.
The application is premised on the grounds on the face of the application and the Supporting Affidavit of Urbanus Kioko dated 9/03/2024 made in support of the application; therein he states that the Respondent instructed the firm of Urbanus K.& Associates Advocates to act for its client in the matter arising from Kiambu HCC NO. E052 OF 2021 Irungu Kan’gata & Co. Advocates Vs Trident Insurance Company Limited.






3.
The Respondent failed to pay the legal fees arising from the services rendered thereby necessitating the filing of the Bill of Costs which was taxed and a Certificate of Taxation was issued which taxed costs the Respondent has failed and/or neglected to settle.






4.
In the instant application the Applicant seeks for the Certificate of Costs be adopted as an order and judgment of this court. The application was uncontested as the Respondent failed and or neglected to file any response despite service having been effected.






5.
The Applicant prayed that judgment be entered as prayed for the sum of Khs.80,000/- together with interest thereon. The Applicant also prayed for costs of the application.








Issues For Determination


6.
Having considered the application and the supporting affidavit the issues framed for determination are;
i.
Whether the application is merited for the court to adopt the Certificate of Taxation and enter judgment in the sum of Kshs. 80,000/- and;
ii.
Whether interest is applicable thereon.








Analysis


7.
The applicable law is found at Section 51(2) of the 
Advocates Act
 which provides that:-
“
the certificate of the taxing officer by whom any bill has been taxed shall unless it is set aside or altered by the court, be final as to the amount of the costs recovered thereby; and the court may make such orders in relation thereto as it thinks fit, including where the retainer is not disputed an order that judgment be entered for the sum of certified to be due with costs.”






8.
The wordings of the above section empower the court to enter judgment on the taxed amount if the same is uncontested.






9.
In determining whether the court should adopt the amount on the Certificate of Taxation as the judgment of the court it should be satisfied that the certificate of taxation has not been set aside.






10.
Reference is made to the case of Lubulellah & Associates Advocates Vs N. K. Brothers Limited (2014) eKLR where the court observed that:-
“
The law is very clear that once a taxing master has taxed the costs, issued a Certificate of Costs and there is no reference against his ruling or there has been a ruling and a determination made and not set aside and/or altered, no other action would be required from the court save to enter judgment. An applicant is not required to file suit for the recovery of costs. The certificate of costs is final as to the amounts of the costs and the court would be quite in order to enter judgment in favour of the Applicant against the Respondent herein for the taxed sum indicated in the Certificate of Taxation that was issued on 25
th
 November 2012.”






11.
From perusal of the court record this court is satisfied that the Ruling is uncontested as the Respondent has not moved any court by way of filing a Reference against the ruling nor has the Ruling been set aside, altered, varied and / or reviewed, nor has any appeal been filed.






12.
Therefore, no other action is required from this court save to enter judgment as prayed against the Respondent.








Whether interest is applicable thereon and payable


13.
The Applicant seeks the court to grant interest on the taxed costs at 14% per annum until payment in full. The Applicant makes no mention in the supporting affidavit that it duly served the Respondent with any Demand Letter or the Certificate of Taxation for settlement of the taxed costs;






14.
Rule 7 of the Advocates Remuneration Order provides that:
“
An advocate may charge interests at 14% per annum on his disbursement and costs whether by scale or otherwise, from the expiration of one month from the delivery of his bill to the client, such claim for interests is raised before the amount of the bill has been paid or tendered in full.”






15.
The above rule stipulates that such claim for interest must be raised before for it to start to accrue after the expiration of one month from the delivery of the bill to the client.






16.
In the case of Kerongo & Company Advocates Vs Africa Assurance Merchant Co. Limited [2019] eKLR the court held;
‘An advocate who does not provide proof that he had raised the issue of interest before the amount in the Bill of Costs has been paid or tendered in full will not be paid the interest chargeable under Rule 7 of the Advocates Remuneration Order. As the advocates herein had not demonstrated that they had raised the issue of interest as aforesaid, they could not therefore be awarded interest at fourteen (14%) per cent per annum.’






17.
After careful perusal of the court record nowhere is there any evidence that the Applicant raised a claim for interest. Therefore, in line with Rule 7, the Applicant is found to have failed to furnish proof that it had raised the claim for interest with the Respondent; the prayer for interest to start accruing on the costs is found to be devoid of merit.








Findings & Determination


18.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations: -
i.
This court finds the application to be partially meritorious and it is hereby partially allowed;
ii.
The Certificate of Taxation dated 15/01/2024 in the sum of Kshs.80,000/- is hereby adopted as a Judgment of this court. Judgment be and is hereby entered in favour of the Applicant in the sum of Kshs. 80,000/-;
iii.
The prayer for interest is found to be devoid of merit and it is hereby disallowed.
iv.
Each party to bear own their costs of this application.
Orders Accordingly.

1.
Before court is the Summons dated 25
th
 March, 2021 and brought under Sections 47, 76 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, Cap 160 Laws of Kenya, Rules 44 and 73 of the Probate and Administration Rules and all other enabling provisions of the law. The Applicants sought for orders:-
a.
Spent
b.
Spent
c.
Spent
d.
Spent
e.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to revoke the grant of probate issued on16/9/2019 and the Certificate of Confirmation of Grant dated 23
rd
 November, 2020.
f.
That in the alternative to prayer (e) above, this Honourable Court be pleased to set aside the Certificate of Confirmation of Grant dated 23/11/2020 and grant leave to the Applicants to file an application for reasonable provision from the deceased’s Will.
g.
This Honourable court be and is hereby pleased to order the executors to render a full inventory and account and the extent of the distribution of the estate of the deceased.
h.
This Honourable court be pleased to declare that the Applicants are beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased and entitled to a share of his estate.






2.
The application is based on the grounds that the Applicants were not included as dependants of the deceased and that they were not provided for in the Will of the deceased as such they will be prejudiced if the estate is distributed.






3.
Nancy Wairimu Ngige in her supporting affidavit deposed that she is the deceased’s first wife and her co-applicants are the children of the deceased. She contended that they were not recognized in the deceased’s which they doubt its authenticity or the deceased’s capacity to write it. They were recognized as the first family in the chief’s letter. At the time the deceased wrote the Will, he was very sick. She averred that they were not aware of these proceedings until when she learnt that the Respondent had obtained a grant of probate and the same had been confirmed on 23/11/2020. They had also tried to petition for grant of letters of administration but their petition was rejected at the registry. Lastly, she sought for preservation orders of the estate.






4.
Charity Wambui Ngigi the Respondent herein, filed her replying affidavit sworn on 16
th
 April, 2021, she deposed that the Applicants are strangers to the deceased’s estate. She was married to the deceased in 1986 under the Kikuyu Customary Law and that she lived with the deceased until his death where she assisted in the acquisition of the deceased’s properties. They later conducted a church wedding and the 1
st
 Applicant did not object to the same if indeed she was a 1
st
 wife. The 1
st
 Applicant has to discharge the burden of proving that she is a wife. The deceased could not sire children biologically and as a result they adopted their son Allan Kamami. In the circumstances the deceased cannot be the father to the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Applicants. The Applicants only emerged after the death of the deceased and never helped with the deceased’s medical bills. In any case, the Applicants’ application for exhumation was dismissed as the court found that the Applicant was neither a personal representative or a beneficiary. The summons were said not to meet the required legal standards for revocation of grant. In any case, the deceased died testate and the process of applying for and obtaining for confirmed grant was done in compliance with the law of succession and no objection was filed as such the court should not interfere with the deceased’s Will.






5.
Nancy Wairimu Ngige filed a further affidavit sworn on 16
th
 June, 2021. She averred that she was married to the deceased in 1980 under the Kikuyu Customary Law. She produced her father’s Will where together with the deceased they were bequeathed Plot No. 2489/5/R where they used to reside. In the circumstances, she wonders why the deceased would bequeath the same to the Respondent and also why the deceased would want to be buried in Lang’ata cemetery when he had so much land. She separated with the deceased in 1986 and that the Respondent buried the deceased hurriedly at Lang’ata cemetery. She was welcomed by the deceased’s family causing the Respondent to hurriedly burry the deceased.






6.
Charity Wambui Ngigi filed her response to the further affidavit dated 28
th
 September, 2021. She reiterated that she was married to the deceased in 1986 and never saw the deceased support the Applicants financially. No evidence was produced to support that Plot no. 2489/5/R belonged to the 1
st
 Applicant’s father. That the Applicants have failed to prove that they were depending on the deceased before his demise.






7.
The Summons proceeded for hearing by way of viva voce evidence and thereafter parties filed their written submissions.






Applicants’ Submissions


8.
The Applicants submit that they have proven dependency by producing the birth certificates and that the deceased used to pay school fees and provide upkeep money for the Applicants. Further the Applicants submit that the process of obtaining the grant were attended by procedural flaws, fraud and concealment of matters from this court as she concealed the deceased’s first family. The court was urged to revoke the grant.








Respondent’s Submissions


9.
It was submitted that the Applicants failed to discharge their burden that they were wife and children of the deceased. The 1
st
 Applicant failed to prove that she was married through Kikuyu Customary Law. The Applicants did not prove that they depended on the deceased during his lifetime. Reliance was placed in the case of John Gitata Mwangi & 3 others vs Jonathan Njuguna Mwangi & 4 others (1999) eKLR. Lastly it was submitted that the Applicants have not satisfied any condition for revocation of grant having failed to prove dependency.








Issues for Determination.


10.
Having considered the Summons herein, the Respondent’s replying affidavit and the rival submissions. The issues framed for determination are;-
i.
Whether the Applicants are dependants of the deceased’s estate.
ii.
Whether the grant issued herein should be revoked








Analysis


Whether the Applicants are dependants of the deceased’s estate.


11.
The Applicants contend that they are the wife and the children of the deceased and that they learnt that the deceased has died testate and they were not provided for. The grant was said to be defective as the Applicants were left out. The Applicants submitted that they have proved dependency as such the court should make a provision for them. Finally, the Grant was said to be defective as the Applicants were left out as such they urged the court to revoke the same.








12.
The Respondent submitted that the Applicants failed to prove that they were dependants of the deceased to be provided by the court and that the Applicant failed to prove that she was married to the deceased by way of a Kikuyu customary marriage. In the circumstances the court was urged not to revoke the grant as it was properly obtained.






13.
The formal requirements of a valid Will are found in Section 11 of the 
Law of Succession Act
. It states;-
11.
No written will shall be valid unless-
(a)
The testator has signed or affixed his mark to the will, or it has been signed by some other person in the presence and by the direction of the testator;
(b)
The signature or mark of the testator, or the signature of the person signing for him, is so placed that it shall appear that it was intended thereby to give effect to the writing as a will;
(c)
The will is attested by two or more competent witnesses, each of whom must have seen the testator sign or affix his mark to the will, or have seen some other person sign the will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator, or have received from the testator a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark, or of the signature of that other person; and each of the witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present at the same time, and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary.’






14.
The Applicants claim that the deceased’s Will herein is not valid as at the time of making the Will he was very sick and that they were not provided for in the said Will. The court in Curryian Okumu vs. Perez Okumu & 2 others (2016) eKLR held that;-
“
The legal position is clear however that failure to provide for a beneficiary in a Will does not invalidate a Will. Section 5(1) of the Act gives a testator testamentary freedom as follows:
“Subject to the provisions of this Part and Part III, every person who is of sound mind and not a minor may dispose of all or any of his free property by will, and may thereby make any disposition by reference to any secular or religious law that he chooses …”
… This freedom of a testator to dispose of his free property by will is however is not absolute. The Court can after the death of the testator alter the terms of a will following an application under Section 26 of the Act. Section 26 provides:
“Where a person dies after the commencement of this Act, and so far as succession to his property is governed by the provisions of this Act, then on the application by or on behalf of a dependant, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by his will, or by gift in contemplation of death, or the law relating to intestacy, or the combination of the will, gift and law, is not such as to make reasonable provision for that dependant, order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall be made for that dependant out of the deceased’s net estate.”






15.
This court notes that failure by the deceased to provide for the Applicants cannot be a ground to invalidate the WILL. However, the Court under Section 26 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 can order for a reasonable provision out of the estate.






16.
Section 26 of the Law of the Succession provides that;-
“
Where a person dies after the commencement of this Act, and so far as succession to his property is governed by the provisions of this Act, then on the application by or on behalf of a dependant, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by his will, or by gift in contemplation of death, or the law relating to intestacy, or the combination of the will, gift and law, is not such as to make reasonable provision for that dependant, order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall be made for that dependant out of the deceased’s net estate.”






17.
In the instant case, the 1
st
 Applicant avers that she was married to the deceased under the Kikuyu customary law and that the deceased used to maintain her together with the children before his demise.






18.
Section 29(a) of the 
Law of Succession Act
 defines a ‘dependant’ to mean;-
“
For the purposes of this Part, ""dependant"" means—
a.
the wife or wives, or former wife or wives, and the children of the deceased whether or not maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death;”






19.
This court has perused the record, and has also considered the testimonies tendered by the Applicants’ witnesses. The same does not prove that the 1
st
 Applicant was married to the deceased under Kikuyu Customary Law.






20.
Eugene Cotran’s “Casebook on Kenya Customary Law” at page 30 sets out the essentials of a Kikuyu Customary marriage. These are stipulated as;
1.
Capacity; the parties must have capacity to marry and also the capacity to marry each other.
2.
Consent; the parties to the marriage and their respective families must consent to the union
3.
Ngurario; no marriage is valid under Kikuyu customary law unless the Ngurario ram is slaughtered.
4.
Ruracio; there can be no valid marriage under Kikuyu law unless a part of the ruracio (dowry) has been paid.
5.
Commencement of cohabitation; the moment at which a man and a woman legally become husband and wife is when the man and woman commence cohabitation i.e. under the capture procedure when the marriage is consummated after the eight days’ seclusion, and nowadays when the bride comes to the bride groom’s home”.






21.
Reference was made to the case of Gituanja vs Gituanja [1983] KLR 575 where the Court held inter-alia that;
“
The existence of a marriage is a matter of fact which is proved with evidence. The evidence at the trial produced a valid marriage under Kikuyu customary law as was evidenced by the slaughtering of the ngurario.”






22.
It is also noted that the Applicants contend that the deceased used to support them by paying the children’s school fees and giving them money for their upkeep. However, these claims are not supported by any documentary evidence.






23.
Refer to the case of Beatrice Ciamutua Rugamba v Fredrick Nkari Mutegi & 5 others (2016) eKLR, where the court observed that:
“
A dependent under section 29 (b) and (c) must prove that he or she was being maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his demise. It is not the mere relationship that matters, but proof of dependency that counts.”






24.
In the upshot, this court is satisfied that the Applicants have not demonstrated to this court that they were dependant on the deceased during his lifetime.






Whether the grant issued herein should be revoked


25.
The Applicants requested the court to revoke the grant issued to Charity Wambui Ngigi on 16
th
 September, 2019 and the Certificate of grant dated 23/11/2020 as they were left out and that they were not provided for in the deceased’s Will.








26.
The law in regard to revocation and annulment of grants is found under Section 76 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 which provides as follows: -
‘A grant of representation, whether or not confirmed, may at any time be revoked or annulled if the court decides, either on application by an interested party or of its own motion-
a.
That the proceedings to obtain the grant were defective in substance;
b.
That the grant was obtained fraudulently by the making of a false statement or by the concealment from the court of something material to the case;
c.
That the grant was obtained by means of untrue allegation of a fact essential in point of law to justify the grant notwithstanding that the allegation was made in ignorance or inadvertently;
d.
That the person to whom the grant was made has failed, after due notice and without reasonable cause either-
i.
to apply for confirmation of the grant within one year from the date thereof, or such longer period as the court has ordered or allowed; or
(ii)
to proceed diligently with the administration of the estate; or
(iii)
to produce to the court, within the time prescribed, any such inventory or account of administration as is required by the provisions of paragraphs(e) and (g) of section 83 has produced any such inventory or account which is false in any material particular; or
f.
The grant has become useless and inoperative through subsequent circumstances.’






27.
See the case of Jesse Karaya Gatimu vs Mary Wanjiku Githinji (2014) eKLR, where the court opined that -
‘The grounds upon which a grant may be revoked or annulled are thus statutory and it is incumbent upon any party making an application for revocation or annulment of grant to demonstrate the existence of any, some or all of these grounds, whatever the case may be.’






28.
In this instance the deceased died on 14
th
 January, 2019 leaving behind his Will dated 29
th
 June, 2018 where he distributed his estate. The Respondent herein was appointed as the executrix and she petitioned for a grant of probate and a certificate of confirmation of grant was issued 23/11/2020.






29.
The Applicants contend that they were left out as beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate and that they were not provided for in the WILL by the deceased. Having found that the Applicants are not dependants of the estate of the deceased as the same has not been proved, finds that the deceased’s Will dated 29
th
 June, 2018 is valid as such the prayer for provision by the court is found to be without merit.






30.
In the end this court is satisfied that the deceased’s Will is valid. The grant was properly issued as such the same cannot be revoked.






Findings and Determination


31.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds that the Applicants were not dependants of the deceased.
ii.
This court finds the Will to be valid.
iii.
This court finds the application to Revoke the Grant to be devoid of merit and the same is hereby dismissed
iv.
This being a family matter each party to bear their own costs.
Orders Accordingly

Ruling










1.
The applicants have moved this court through Chamber Summons dated 29
th
 August 2024 under Rule 3 of the High Court (Practice and Procedure) Rules “vacation rules” seeking to be heard during the current High Court vacation. The substantive application filed on even date is anchored on section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Code wherein the applicants seek to be released on bail pending the hearing of the application and their appeal.






2.
The application is supported by the Affidavit sworn by their counsel Isaac Rene. The applicants aver that their appeal, against the conviction and sentence, passed in ACCR No. 3 of 2019 Republic vs Moses Kasaine Lenolkulal & 11 others has overwhelming chances of success as can be gleaned from the annexed Petition of Appeal wherein the applicants have enumerated nine (9) grounds of appeal to with;
a.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact, in failing to find and hold that the letter dated 5th April, 2013 (Exhibit 238) by the 1
st
 Applicant declaring interest in Oryx Service Station and Conflict of Interest Register (Exhibit 387) was lawful, sufficient and consistent with Article 73(2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, Section 43 of the Public Procurement and Disposal 
Act No 2 of 2005
 (repealed) and Section 59(3) of the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
, 2015;
b.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact, in failing to consider a crucial and substantial fact that the County Government of Samburu indeed got value for its money, goods were ordered and indeed delivered, and that the Auditor General's Reports (Exhibits D1- 2(a)(b)(c)(d) and (e) confirmed this fact;
c.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact, in failing to find and hold that there were inconsistencies and contradictions on the amounts set out in the charge sheet and the amounts extracted from the IFMIS platform;
d.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in fact, in making a finding without any evidence on record whatsoever that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Applicants herein divided the public funds allegedly unlawfully acquired by them in the sum of Kshs. 83,460,995.00; among other grounds.






3.
It is further deponed that the 1
st
 Applicant suffers from a repeated bout of hypertension and there is a high risk that the 1
st
 Applicant being confined to jail could trigger rapid health deterioration and a life-threatening condition named pre-eclampsia. On the other hand, it is alleged that the 2
nd
 Applicant suffers from Type 2 Diabetes with a complication of peripheral neuropathy and has been on treatment since the year 2023 hence his medical condition would certainly cause grave danger to his life if in detention while the Appeal is pending hearing and determination.






4.
The applicants further aver that they have at all times, complied with the Bail/Bond terms which had hitherto been affixed by the Trial Magistrate, have always presented themselves to the Court, and have demonstrated that they are not flight risks.






5.
I have carefully considered the grounds on the face of the application and the affidavit in support thereof. Noting that the applicants seek to be released on bail pending the hearing of their appeal, the court must examine whether the applicants have made out a case, prima facie, to warrant being released on bail at this stage. I say so because the applicants are prima facie convicts and their constitutional rights and freedoms are patently circumscribed by their conviction. The applicants do not enjoy the constitutional right to be presumed innocent which right is available to persons facing/awaiting trial in terms of Article 49(1)(h) of 
the Constitution
.






6.
Further, I am mindful that the instant application has not been served and responded to by the State hence the court does not have the benefit of the respective parties' positions to the application. In considering this application, therefore, I am careful not to delve into the merits of the application to avoid foreclosing the right of response by the adverse party ultimately jeopardizing the hearing of the application on merit.






7.
In Charles Owanga Aluoch v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] eKLR, the court held that:-
“
The right to bail is provided under Article 49(1) of 
the Constitution
 but is at the discretion of the court, and is not absolute. Bail is a constitutional right where one is awaiting trial. After conviction that right is at the court’s discretion and upon considering the circumstances of the application. The courts have over the years formulated several principles and guidelines upon which bail pending appeal is anchored…”






8.
The Court of Appeal in Jivraj Shah v Republic[1986] eKLR held as follows: -
“
There is not a great deal of local authority on this matter and for our part such as we have seen and heard tends to support the view that the principal consideration is if there exist exceptional or unusual circumstances upon which this court can fairly conclude that it is in the interest of justice to grant bail. If it appears prima facie from the totality of the circumstances that the appeal is likely to be successful on account of some substantial point of law to be urged, and that the sentence, or a substantial part of it, will have been served by the time the appeal is heard, conditions for granting bail will exist. The decision in Somo v Republic [1972] E A 476 which was referred to by this court with approval in Criminal Application No NAI 14 of 1986, Daniel Dominic Karanja v Republic where the main criteria was stated to be the existence of overwhelming chances of success does not differ from a set of circumstances which disclose substantial merit in the appeal which could result in the appeal being allowed. 
The proper approach is the consideration of the particular circumstances and the weight and relevance of the points to be argued. It is almost self-defeating to attempt to define phrases or to establish formulae.
” (Emphasis added)






9.
Further, the Supreme Court of Uganda in Arvind Patel -vs- Uganda S.C Cr. Appeal No. 1 of 2003 set out the considerations for grant of bail pending appeal as follows:
a.
Whether the applicant is or not a first offender;
b.
Whether the offence of which the applicant is convicted involved personal violence;
c.
The appeal must not be frivolous and have reasonable chance of success;
d.
The possibility of substantial delay in the determination of appeal and;
e.
Whether the applicant complied with bail conditions granted before the applicant's conviction during the pendency of the appeal.






10.
Guided by the above instructive authorities, it is discernible that the arguability of the appeal and its reasonable chances of success intrinsically remain the paramount considerations in an application of this nature.






11.
I have reviewed the grounds of the appeal as well as the judgement and sentence of the trial court. I find that the appeal raises fundamental and arguable questions of both law and fact which, upon hearing, may upset the findings of the trial court.






12.
For instance, under count IV as highlighted in the introductory part of the trial court's judgment, the applicants were charged with unlawful acquisition of public property in section 45 (1) (a) as read with section 48 (1) of the 
Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act
 No. 3 of 2003 whose value is pegged at Kshs 84,695,996.55/=. The applicants were however sentenced to a mandatory fine of Kshs. 83,460,995.00 equivalent to twice the benefit after dividing the public funds unlawfully acquired between them.






13.
Further, it is urged in the grounds of appeal that the County Government of Samburu indeed got value for its money, which is the subject and basis of the convictions of the applicants. To my mind, these are, among others, arguable and critical questions that the appellate court must grapple with which, if proved, are capable of assailing the findings of the trial magistrate thus rendering the appeal meritorious.






14.
With regard to the health conditions of the applicants, I am guided by the holding of the Court of Appeal in Epungure v Republic (Criminal Appeal E015 of 2021) [2021] KECA 343 (KLR) and John Koyi Waluke & another v Republic [2020] eKLR where the court held that it does not amount to an unusual or exceptional circumstance as the applicant can obtain medical care from the prison facilities, and if need be, can be referred to government health facilities for further treatment. As such I reject the said grounds in their entirety.






15.
The other issue raised was the legality of sentences imposed. It is trite law that sentencing is a discretion exercised by the trial court unless proved that it was arrived at after considering wrong principles. In arriving at this finding, I am guided by the holding in the case of Ogolla S/O Owuor Vs Republic (1954) EACA 270 Where the court stated that;
“
The court does not alter a sentence unless the trial Judge has acted upon wrong principles or overlooked some material factors’’






16.
I do not wish to comment on the legality of the sentence at this stage as it will prejudice the outcome of the main appeal. I leave the arguments of that ground for the main appeal.






17.
I also note that the offences in question did not involve personal violence hence the applicants do not pose any risk to society or themselves.






18.
In the premises, prima facie and in exercising my discretion, I make the following orders: -
a.
The application dated 29
th
 August 2024 is certified as urgent.
b.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 applicants are each admitted to a bond of Kshs. 10,000,000/= with one surety of a similar amount.
c.
The applicants shall deposit in court their passports and or all travelling documents before being released.
d.
The application and petition of appeal shall be served upon the respondent within seven (7) days from the date hereof.
e.
Upon service, the respondent shall file their response within fourteen days.
f.
The deputy registrar shall ensure the original lower court file and certified record of proceedings are availed to the High Court at the earliest opportunity.
g.
This matter is fixed for mention on 31
st
 October 2024 before the Presiding Judge, Milimani Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division, and for further directions.

Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgement the High Court of Kenya at Siaya (J.A. Makau) dated 19th April 2018inHCRA No. 30 of 2015)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Eric Oduorthe appellant before us was tried and convicted by the High Court (J.A. Makau) at Siaya, of the offence of Murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to serve 45 years’ imprisonment.






2.
The particulars of the information upon which the appellant was tried, were that, on 6
th
 November, 2014 at Kagilo Sub-location, Gem Sub County within Siaya County, jointly with others not before the Court, he murdered Callisto Agingo Okello (herein deceased).






3.
During the trial 6 witnesses testified for the prosecution. These were Simon Okoth Obiero - the Assistant Chief of Kagilo Sub Location, Caroline Adhiambo Aginga (Caroline) - the wife to the deceased, Joseph Owuor Bala (Bala) - a resident of Kagilo, Paul Okumu Okello (Paul) also a resident of Kagilo, Inspector Charles Mokaya (IP Mokaya) then Deputy OCS Yala Police station who was the investigating officer and also arrested the appellant, and finally, Dr Biko Opidi, a medical officer at Siaya Referral Hospital who produced the post mortem report on behalf of Dr Collins Oginga who carried out the post mortem examination.






4.
The prosecution evidence was that, on the material day the Assistant Chief had a meeting which was attended by many people. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss incidents of stock theft. The meeting became rowdy when one Christopher Noga whose livestock had been stolen mentioned the deceased as a suspect. The deceased denied the allegation, but conceded having admitted the alleged infraction to one Odhiambo Noga. However, the deceased maintained that the admission was done in a drunken stupor and was actually not true that he had stolen the cattle. The appellant and two other persons then took the deceased outside tied up his hands and beat him using logs and branches of a tree, demanding to know where he had taken the cattle.






5.
Bala and Paul who had attended the meeting both testified that they saw the deceased and one Otieno, being beaten by the appellant and two other men identified as Odhiambo and Omondi. The deceased and Otieno were then taken to the Administration Police at the DC’s office where they found the Assistant chief who had gone to call for help from the Administration police officers based at the DC’s office. The Assistant chief directed that the two be taken to the Hospital. On arrival at Yala Level IV Hospital the deceased was confirmed dead.






6.
Caroline heard of her husband’s plight from her sister in law. She proceeded to the main Road that is Wagai-Nyangweso Road, where she found the deceased with his hands tied with a nylon rope. She found the appellant and Odhiambo Noga beating up the deceased who was lying on the ground. She screamed and ran to the DC’s office where she found the Assistant Chief. Subsequently, the deceased was brought to the DC’s office by Boda Boda riders. According to Caroline the deceased was already dead but the police at the DC’s office directed that he be taken to Hospital. When Caroline arrived at the Hospital, she found that the deceased had been declared dead so she went home.






7.
Two days later, Caroline identified the body of the deceased to Dr Collins Oginga who performed a postmortem examination. The report of the examination was produced in evidence by Dr Biko Opidi. According to the postmortem report, the deceased had multiple bruises on both upper limbs. There was also blood collection in the lungs, spleen was torn, the right and left kidney raptured, intra-abdominal bleeding, testicles and penis swollen, and the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 vertebrae of the spinal column were fractured. Dr Oginga formed the opinion that the cause of death was cardio respiratory failure, due to severe lung injury coupled with abdominal viscera rapture.






8.
Inspector Charles Mokaya (IP Mokaya) who was the investigation officer opened an inquest file, but when the file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), he was directed to arrest the appellant, Odhiambo and Otieno, but he only managed to arrest the appellant and charged him with the offence.






9.
In his defence the appellant gave a sworn statement in which he admitted having been present at the meeting called by the Assistant Chief. At the request of the Assistant Chief he escorted him to the police station as the meeting had become rowdy. The appellant stated that the deceased was being beaten by some people, but the Assistant chief cautioned them not to beat him. Later they came back from the station with two police officers and found the deceased lying on the road. The officers instructed that the deceased be taken to hospital, and since there was no vehicle available the appellant carried the deceased to the Hospital where they found his wife already there. They left the deceased at the hospital with his wife. About 5 months later he was arrested by Inspector Mokaya and charged with the offence of murder.






10.
In his judgment the learned Judge of the High Court found that the appellant was placed at the scene of the incident by four eye witnesses, and that Caroline, Bala and Paul all testified that they saw the appellant assault the deceased. Further, that the evidence of IP Mokaya and Dr Opidi confirmed that the deceased’s cause of death arose from injuries that he suffered from an assault, and therefore the death of the deceased and cause of death were proved. The learned Judge found malice aforethought established through the nature of injuries that were inflicted upon the deceased, as the injuries were either intended to cause grievous harm or death to the deceased. The learned Judge therefore rejected the appellant’s defence and convicted him of the charge.






11.
In his memorandum of appeal filed through his advocate, Ochieng Bilha Erykah, the appellant faulted the learned judge for relying on conflicting and contradictory evidence; failing to find that the prosecution failed to call crucial and independent witnesses to prove their case; failing to appreciate that the prosecution did not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt; and failing to consider the mitigation raised by the appellant in sentencing him.






12.
During the plenary hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by his counsel, while the respondent was represented by Mr. Onanda Antony of the ODPP. Both counsel relied on their written submissions.






13.
In the written submissions, counsel for the appellant pointed out that Caroline admitted having lied to the police, and this rendered her entire testimony unreliable; Caroline also contradicted herself when she first stated that the deceased was taken to Hospital by boda boda riders and later said that it is the appellant who took him to Hospital; and that Caroline’s statement to the police and her evidence in Court were completely different.






14.
The appellant also submitted that there was contradiction as to how many people assaulted the deceased as the Assistant Chief stated it was the public, Caroline stated that they were only two people, Bala stated they were 3 people, whilst IP Mokaya stated it was a mob. There was also contradiction regarding the time the incident happened. The Court was, therefore, urged to find that the prosecution evidence was fabricated and unreliable.






15.
Finally, counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution failed in its duty to call crucial witnesses. For instance, Otieno, who was also alleged to have been assaulted alongside the deceased was not called as a witness. The Court was urged to follow Bukenya & others vs Uganda [1972] EA 549, and conclude that the witness was not called because his evidence would have been adverse to the prosecution case. Similarly, the appellant contended, the boda boda riders who took the deceased to hospital were also not called to testify.






16.
In addition, it was submitted that the prosecution did not prove the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, as the postmortem report that was produced in evidence was not adequate to prove that it is the deceased who caused the injuries, nor did the prosecution produce any murder weapon. Further, the Assistant Chief, Caroline and Bala did not immediately identify the appellant to the police as the person who caused the injuries to the deceased, and only reported the matter four days later. Finally, mens rea was not proved as there was no evidence of malice aforethought, nor was there any evidence as to why the appellant would have assaulted the deceased.






17.
On sentence, the Court was urged to consider the mitigation that was raised by the appellant and reduce the sentence that was imposed upon him by the trial court. The Supreme Court decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another -vs- Republic, Petiti
on No. 15 of 2016
, was cited, and the court urged to take into account that the appellant was a first offender, and had been in custody since his arrest in March, 2014. In addition, he was the sole breadwinner of his family and is remorseful.






18.
In its written submissions filed through Mr. Onanda Antony, a Senior Principal Prosecution Counsel in the office of the ODPP, counsel submitted that the ingredients of the offence of murder, which are malice aforethought, cause of death, identification of the appellant and placing of the appellant at the scene, were all established. Counsel argued that malice aforethought was established through evidence regarding the circumstances of the offence, including the extent of the injuries suffered by the deceased such as severe lung injury coupled with abdominal visceral rapture that was caused by a blunt force. Counsel added that there was evidence that the appellant in collusion with others tied up the deceased and inflicted grievous injuries on him, and that the postmortem report that was produced in evidence established the deceased’s cause of death.






19.
As regards the alleged contradictory and inconsistent evidence, counsel submitted that the prosecution witnesses were consistent in their evidence regarding what led to the death of the deceased. He argued that if there were any contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses, the same were very minor, and did not shake the substance of the prosecution case. He cited Joseph Maina Mwangi -vs- Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 73 of 1993; where this Court stated:
“
In any trial there are bound to be discrepancies. An appellate court in considering those discrepancies must be guided by the wording of Section 382 of Criminal Procedure Code viz whether such discrepancies are so fundamental as to cause prejudice to the appellant or they are inconsequential to the conviction and sentences.”






20.
As regards sentence, Mr. Onanda submitted that the appellant was accorded a fair trial and that his mitigation was properly considered before the sentence was imposed. The Court was, therefore, urged to uphold the conviction and sentence.






21.
We have carefully considered this appeal, the submissions made before us and the law. This being a first appeal, it is our duty to exhaustively reconsider and re-evaluate the evidence that was adduced in the trial court in light of the law, and draw our own conclusions in determining whether the judgment of the trial court should be upheld. In doing so, we bear in mind what this Court stated in Kiilu & Another vs. Republic [2005]1 KLR 174:
1.
An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions.
2.
It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court’s findings and conclusions; Only then can it decide whether the Magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.






22.
The appellant was charged with the offence of murder and it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the ingredients of the offence of murder. This required proof that the death of the deceased occurred;
that the death was caused by an act or omission on the part of the appellant; and that in committing the act or omission the appellant had malice aforethought. These are the matters that we shall inquire into in addressing the evidence that was before the trial court.






23.
There is no dispute that the deceased died. This was clear from the evidence of the Assistant Chief, Caroline and Bala. It was also confirmed by the Dr. Collins Oginga who performed the postmortem examination. The postmortem examination also revealed that the deceased died as a result of injuries which included multiple bruises and injuries to the respiratory system, resulting in hemorrhagic lungs and hemorrthorax, torn spleen, raptured left and right kidney with intra-abdominal bleeding resulting in cardio respiratory failure, as a result of the severe lung injury coupled with abdominal viscera rapture (kidney and spleen) and resultant hemorrhage.






24.
The question is whether these injuries arose as a result of any act or omission on the part of the appellant. We note that there was talk of “mob justice” and that the police were initially reluctant to charge anyone, instead opting to open an inquest file. This was, however, countermanded by the ODPP who directed the appellant to be arrested and charged. The appellant did not deny being present at the meeting that was called by the Assistant Chief.






25.
Going by the evidence of the Assistant Chief, Bala and Paul, the deceased landed in trouble when he was quoted as having boasted to his brother that he had taken part in the livestock theft which was subject of the discussion. Although the deceased claimed that the statement was not true, but was made as a result of a drunken stupor, the people who were in the meeting were not amused demanding to know from him who had stolen the livestock, and this caused a commotion.






26.
According to Bala, it was the appellant, Odhiambo and Omondi who took the deceased outside the school compound, and started beating him demanding that he produces the livestock that had been stolen. The three beat the deceased for about twenty minutes using sticks from trees.






27.
Paul also stated that the three, that is, Odhiambo, Omondi and the appellant, were outside, that they returned back to the meeting and while the prayers to close the meeting were being said, the appellant took the deceased and one Otieno outside, and tied their hands separately. The appellant was then joined by Odhiambo and Omondi and the three proceeded to beat the deceased and Otieno for about twenty minutes.






28.
On his part, the Assistant Chief explained that he adjourned the meeting and remained behind talking to some members of the public, when he heard people quarrelling outside the school compound, demanding to be told who was the suspect. He decided to call the DC’s office for reinforcement but this took long; and that he heard screams and the public beating up the deceased although he did not go outside for fear. He decided to walk to the DC’s place to report the matter, and as they were walking out of the DC’s camp to go back to the scene, he saw some boda boda carrying the deceased and one Otieno, and the police ordered the boda boda to take the two to the hospital. On arrival at the hospital the deceased was declared dead.






29.
The other material witness was Caroline, who upon learning of what was happening to the deceased, proceeded to the scene and found the deceased’s hands tied with a nylon rope. The appellant and Odhiambo were beating the deceased who was lying on the ground. Caroline ran to the DC’s office after the appellant threatened to beat her if she did not keep quiet. While at the DC’s office, her husband was brought; and then taken to Yala Level IV Hospital. She followed, but when she arrived at the hospital, she found that her husband had been confirmed dead.






30.
While the evidence of these material witnesses is not exactly identical, it is clear that Bala and Paul both saw the appellant, Odhiambo and Omondi, beating up the deceased, and this was outside the Hall where the meeting was taking place. It is true that there was a crowd present, but it is the appellant and these other two people who beat up the deceased. Caroline was not present at the meeting, she saw her husband being beaten by the appellant and Odhiambo on the main road, just before he was taken to the DC’s office. She did not see Omondi beat her husband, because at that particular time Omondi was not there. Contrary to the appellant’s contention that there was contradiction regarding how many people assaulted the deceased, it is evident that Caroline, Bala and Paul all identified him as having been among three people who assaulted the deceased initially, and Caroline only later saw the appellant and Odhiambo assaulting the deceased






31.
The Assistant Chief was not quite clear on the identity of the persons who assaulted the deceased, but the evidence was that he was inside the hall when the assault took place outside, and because of the commotion outside, he may have genuinely believed that it was a mob that had attacked the deceased. As for Inspector Mokaya, he was not an eye- witness and only relied on information given to him. In our view, there was no material contradiction in the prosecution evidence regarding who assaulted the deceased.






32.
The deceased suffered his injuries as a result of being assaulted by three people, and the appellant was positively identified by three eye witnesses as one of the persons who assaulted the deceased. The appellant’s defence denying having participated in assaulting the deceased was, therefore, properly rejected. There was no evidence that any murder weapon was recovered, and it matters not that no murder weapon was produced. We, therefore, have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the deceased suffered the injuries that caused his death as a result of the actions of the appellant and the two other people.






33.
The vicious nature of the attack is evident from the injuries that the deceased suffered. Under Section 206(a) of the Penal Code, malice aforethought can be inferred where there is intention to cause the death of, or to do grievous harm to any person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not. Through their action of severely beating up the deceased, the appellant and his two colleagues evinced a common intention of causing either grievous harm or death to the deceased. We, therefore, find that the appellant had malice aforethought. Consequently, we find that all the ingredients of the offence of murder were established, and the appellant was properly convicted as the charge against him was proved to the required standard. The trial Judge cannot be faulted in this regard.






34.
On the sentence, under Section 204 of the Penal Code a person convicted of murder under Section 203 is liable to be sentenced to death. In Bernard Kimani Gacheru vs. Republic [2002] eKLR, this Court stated:
“
It is now settled law, following several authorities by this Court and by the High Court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that the trial court overlooked some material factor, or took into account some wrong material, or acted on a wrong principle. Even if, the Appellate Court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone of the matters already states is shown to exist.”






35.
In sentencing the appellant, the trial Judge considered the appellant’s mitigation and sentenced him to serve forty-five years’ imprisonment. The appellant has complained that the trial Judge failed to consider his mitigation. This is not correct as the record indicates that the trial Judge took into account the appellant’s mitigation which included the fact that he was remorseful, was a first offender and a family man. The learned Judge exercised his discretion and did not give the appellant the death penalty, but instead imposed the prison term of forty-five years. In our view, the learned Judge properly exercised his discretion as the trial court, and we have no reason to interfere.






36.
The upshot of the above is that we uphold the appellant’s conviction and sentence, and dismiss the appeal in its entirety.

Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma, (Sitati, J.) dated 22nd May, 2019inHCCRA No. 106 of 2016)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Peter Maikuma Okumu, the appellant herein, was tried and convicted for the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
sexual Offences Act
. He was sentenced to serve 20 years’ imprisonment; the child victim being aged 12 years. He appealed to the High Court but his appeal was unsuccessful - both the conviction and sentence being upheld.






2.
He has now appealed to this Court against both conviction and sentence. In his original memorandum of appeal, he raised ten grounds contending inter alia that he was convicted and sentenced on a defective charge sheet for a nonexistent offence; that the ingredients of the charge of defilement, including penetration, were not established; that there were glaring inconsistencies, discrepancies and contradictions in the prosecution case; that his alibi defence was not considered, and that the court erred in basing a conviction on a charge that did not have a prescribed sentence.






3.
The appellant also filed six supplementary grounds of appeal, in which he contended that his right to a fair trial, as guaranteed under Article 50(2) of 
the Constitution
 was breached; that the High Court erred in associating the breakage of the complainant’s hymen with the appellant, and failing to note that there was no forensic or scientific evidence including DNA that could connect the appellant with the offence; and that the court erred in failing to note that the appellant was not furnished with the prosecution witness statements, and could not, therefore, take advantage of Section 165 of the 
Evidence Act
.






4.
The appellant filed written submissions in which he argued that penetration was not proved as there was no evidence of any injuries and the doctor could not tell when penetration occurred, if at all. He also contended that the age of the complainant was not proved; and that although it was alleged that the hymen was absent, this could not necessarily establish penetration. He maintained that his alibi defence was not considered, and that the court did not exercise discretion in imposing the minimum sentence, because it did not take into account his mitigation including his age which was then 65 years and currently 71 years.






5.
The appellant further submitted that the minimum mandatory sentence provisions provided under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006, are unjust and unfair, as they fetter the discretion of Judges and Magistrates in sentencing. In this regard, he relied on Yawa Nyale -vs- Republic [2018] eKLR. He urged the Court to quash his conviction and set aside the sentence that was imposed upon him.






6.
The respondent filed written submissions through Grace Gacau, a prosecuting counsel in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The respondent submitted that the key ingredients of the offence of defilement include proof of the age of the complainant, proof of penetration, and proof that the appellant was the perpetrator of the defilement.






7.
As regards age, the respondent cited Richard Wahome Chege v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2014, contending that the complainant’s mother, who testified as PW4, was clear on the age of the complainant, and produced a birth certificate which clearly established that her age was 12 years.






8.
On proof of penetration, the respondents cited Mark Oiruri Mose v Republic [2013] eKLR, for the proposition that:
“
So long as there is penetration whether only on the surface, the ingredient of the offence is demonstrated, and penetration need not be deep inside the girl’s organ”






9.
The respondent also relied on Erick Onyango Ondeng’ vs Republic [2014] eKLR, where it was stated that in sexual offences, the slightest penetration of a female organ by a male sex organ is sufficient to constitute the offence, and it is not necessary that the hymen be raptured. The respondent argued that the findings indicated on the P3 form and the PRC form, confirmed that there was proof of penetration. In addition, the clinical officer who testified as PW3 stated that the minor’s labia minora and the vagina were inflamed and tender, which was consistent with penetration.






10.
On the issue of identification, the respondent submitted that the appellant was not a stranger to the complainant, and that he actually accosted and defiled the complainant on three other occasions. She was therefore able to properly and accurately identify him to the investigating officer.






11.
On the issue of a defective charge sheet, the respondent cited this Court’s decision in Peter Ngure Mwangi v Republic [2014] eKLR, and submitted that though the appellant was charged under Section 8(1)(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the charge sheet clearly spelt out the correct section creating the offence of defilement, which is 8(1), and that the particulars of the offence which included the date of the offence, the place of the offence, the act constituting the offence, the name and age of the victim, were all included in the charge sheet. It was submitted that the mistake on the charge sheet regarding the section under which the offence was committed, was a typographical error which did not materially affect the proceedings in the trial court, as the charge sheet clearly cited the section creating the offence, and the offence exists in the law.






12.
The respondent, relying on Moses Nato Raphael v Republic [2015] eKLR, submitted that in that decision, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between proof of age for purposes of establishing the offence of defilement, and age for purposes of sentencing. The respondent urged that the error on the charge sheet was innocuous and curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and that in any case no prejudice was caused to the appellant as he clearly understood the charge facing him, and the ingredients of the charge, and was, therefore, able to model his defence accordingly.






13.
As regards the appellant’s defence of alibi, the respondent submitted that the appellant never gave an account of his whereabouts on the material dates of the offence being 17
th
 February, 2015, to 19
th
 February, 2015, either through his own testimony or that of his witnesses. The defence raised was, therefore, an afterthought and did not constitute an alibi.






14.
Finally, the respondent submitted that the appellant was sentenced to 20 years, and the victim having been 12 years old, the sentence imposed on the appellant was within the law and was properly upheld by the 1
st
 appellate court. The Court was, therefore, urged to uphold the appellant’s conviction and sentence, and dismiss the appeal in its entirety.






15.
We have carefully considered the appeal, the submissions made by the parties and the law. We also bear in mind that this is a second appeal which under Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is limited to considering matters of law only. We take note that we have not had the advantage of seeing the witnesses testify and therefore as stated in Stephen Muriungi and another v Republic [1982-88] 1 KAR 360, we must defer to the findings of the trial court on facts and only interfere when it is clear that the trial court misapprehended the facts or arrived at a conclusion that was clearly wrong.






16.
During the plenary hearing of the appeal, the appellant initially insisted that he was appealing against both conviction and sentence and relied on his written submissions which we have already referred to above. At the end of his submissions, the appellant pleaded that his sentence be reduced because he was unwell, he is anemic and has had to have blood transfusion twice. He then indicated that he wished to withdraw his appeal against conviction. This would imply that he is only appealing the sentence. However, since the appellant had essentially argued his appeal against conviction, it is appropriate that we address the same.






17.
The ingredients of the offence of defilement under Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 are clear and were well set out by the respondents in their submissions. These are: proof of the age of the complainant, proof of penetration, and proof that the appellant was the perpetrator of the offence.






18.
From the concurrent findings that were made by the two courts below, there was clear evidence that the appellant, who was properly identified by the child, accosted the child in a maize plantation, tripped her and upon her falling on the ground, proceeded to remove her panties and inserted his penis into her vagina, having removed his trousers. The child screamed and her creams attracted her father who, on rushing to the scene, saw the appellant still in the process of defiling the child. Apart from the child’s evidence and that of her father, the penetration was confirmed by medical evidence, the clinical officer who examined the child concluding that there was evidence of sexual activity as the child’s labia and vaginal walls were inflamed and tender, and that there was a whitish substance from the vaginal area. Thus, there was overwhelming evidence implicating the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence. The complainant’s age was also established through production of a birth certificate.






19.
The only substantive issue in regard to the appellant’s conviction was the alleged defective charge sheet, the charge sheet having indicated that the appellant was charged with “Defilement contrary to Section 8(1)(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.” This was a defect as the relevant section ought to have been section 8(1) as read with section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The question is whether this is a fatal defect and whether any prejudice was caused to the appellant. In our view, the defect is not a fatal defect but a simple typographical error that is curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






20.
The appellant was not in any way prejudiced by this defect, as the particulars of the charge were very clear, and the appellant was in a position to understand the charge facing him. Indeed, he responded to the charge facing him as defilement involving a child of 12 years and therefore falling under Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences act
. We find that nothing turns on the alleged defect as the same was not prejudicial to the appellant and is curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






21.
As regards the appellant’s complaint regarding violation of his constitutional rights, we have on our part examined the proceedings in the trial court, and do note that on 27
th
 July, 2015, when the appellant was first taken to Court, the substance of the charge was explained to him and he pleaded not guilty and an order was made for him to be released on bond with surety, and for witness statements to be availed to him.






22.
Thereafter, the matter came before the trial court for mention several times, and the appellant did not complain about not being furnished with the witness statements. On 17
th
 September, 2015, when the hearing proceeded the appellant indicated he was ready to proceed and indeed, the hearing proceeded. No issue arose before the trial magistrate, regarding failure to furnish the appellant with witness statements.






23.
Of interest, however, is the fact that on 22
nd
 January, 2016, long after the hearing had commenced, the appellant is recorded as having appeared before S.N. Abuya, PM where he asked for statements. He did not clarify which statements he wanted, but the court made an order for the prosecution to supply him with copies of the said documents. On 5
th
 February, 2016, he again appeared before S.N. Abuya, PM, and made the same request and again an order is recorded that he should be given copies of the said statements before the hearing date. On 11
th
 February, 2016, hearing proceeded before the trial court (C.N. Oruo, RM) and the last prosecution witness testified, where upon the court ruled that the appellant had a case to answer. The appellant indicated that he would give unsworn evidence and that he had three witnesses to call. The Court then ordered that the defence hearing would proceed on 23
rd
 March, 2016.






24.
Thereafter, the appellant appeared before the trial court on 9th March, 2016 for mention, and he did not raise any complaint. but on 18
th
 March, 2016, he appeared for mention before S.N. Abuya, PM and he is indicated as asking for witness statements and S.N. Abuya, PM making an order for the prosecution to supply him with the said documents. Thereafter, on 23
rd
 March, 2016, he appeared before the trial court where he proceeded to give his unsworn statement, called one witness in his defence and closed his case. Again he made not complaint before the trial magistrate nor did he request for any statements before his defence hearing.






25.
We do not understand why the appellant never complained before the trial magistrate about not having been given statements, either before the trial started or during the trial. The order for him to be supplied with the statement was made when he first appeared before the trial magistrate for plea, and if the order was not complied with the trial magistrate was the most appropriate person to whom he should have complained. The appellant appeared to have been comfortable in proceeding with the case, and he cross-examined the prosecution witnesses and even proceeded with his defence without difficulty. The only conclusion we can draw from the appellant’s failure to complain about the statements before the trial magistrate, is the possibility that he had actually received the statements. The applications for statements before a magistrate other than the trial magistrate even after the prosecution witnesses had given evidence, was not a genuine request. We, therefore, find no substance in this ground.






26.
On sentence, the appellant pleaded with us to reduce his 20 years’ term of imprisonment. Under Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the minimum sentence provided where a victim is aged between “twelve and fifteen years”, is twenty years’ imprisonment. The circumstances of the offence leading to the appellant’s conviction were serious, given the young age of the child and the manner in which the offence was committed. The sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment was no doubt deserved.






27.
The appellant now pleads that we reconsider the sentence as his circumstances have now changed: He is ailing and is a very old man; He has been in prison since 15
th
 April, 2016, when he was convicted, and has therefore already served over eight years of the 20 years’ imprisonment sentence that was imposed upon him. His age is currently 71 years and his ill health, is certainly a matter of concern, and we do sympathize.






28.
Much as we wish we could tamper justice with mercy, we are constrained by our jurisdiction as provided under section 361(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which circumscribes our jurisdiction on second appeal to matters of law only, severity of sentence being excluded as a matter of fact. Secondly, the Supreme Court has reiterated, in its recent decision in 
Republic v Mwangi; Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) & 3 others (Amicus Curiae) (Petition E018 of 2023
) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR), that until the issue of the constitutionality of minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 is addressed by the High Court as a constitutional issue, and escalated to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court for a conclusive determination, the minimum sentence under section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 remains lawful and binding on the Court.






29.
For the above reasons the appellant’s appeal fails. Both the conviction and sentence are affirmed. We direct that under section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment shall run from 22
nd
 July, 2015 when the appellant was arrested and remanded in custody.

Respondent







        
          ((An appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Bungoma (R. Sitati J.) dated 14th  May 2019 in HCCRA No. 105 of 2017)
        
      






Judgment










1.
On 11
th
 February 2016, the appellant was arraigned before the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Bungoma in Criminal Case No. 377 of 2016, charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8 (1)as read with section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The allegations against him were that on 9
th
 February 2016 at [particulars withheld] within Bungoma County, he caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of HLS, a Child aged 1 year and 8 months.






2.
After hearing the case, the learned magistrate, by a judgment dated 29
th
 June 2017, found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant, convicted him and sentenced him to serve life imprisonment. Aggrieved by the said verdict, the appellant appealed against both the conviction and sentence in Bungoma High Court Criminal Appeal No. 105 of 2017. After hearing the appeal, Sitati J., in the impugned judgment dated 14
th
 May 2019, upheld the conviction and sentence, and dismissed his appeal.






3.
Undeterred, the appellant filed this second appeal to this Court. In his undated supplementary memorandum and grounds of appeal, the appellant is essentially appealing against the sentence only. In that regard, the appellant is challenging the constitutionality of the life sentence imposed upon him on the grounds that indeterminate sentences have been held to be unconstitutional. To buttress his argument, he cited Reyes vs. The Queen [2002] 2 AC 335. He urged this Court, in the event it agrees with him, to invoke section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code and order that the period he was held in custody be taken into account. In support of this position, he cited this Court in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs. Republic [2018] eKLR. Lastly, the appellant urged the Court to be guided by Article 27 (1) and (4) of 
the Constitution
 and Article 10 Clause 3 of the ICCPR which guarantees equality and protection before the law.






4.
Ms. Kibet, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides for life imprisonment upon conviction for the offence of defilement under section 8 (1). Counsel argued that the sentence that was imposed on the appellant conforms with the law as provided. Counsel also argued that there is nothing to show that the learned Judge overlooked material considerations while passing the sentence. Consequently, counsel urged this Court to uphold the sentence.






5.
We have considered the grounds of appeal and the parties’ submissions. Under section 361(1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, severity of sentence is a matter of fact, and this Court cannot hear a second appeal on a matter of fact. Under section 361(1)(b), the Court cannot hear an appeal against sentence, except where a sentence has been enhanced by the High Court, unless the trial court had no power to pass the sentence in the first place. This was not the case here.






6.
However, there are several decisions of this Court holding that determining the constitutionality of a sentence imposed in a criminal trial is a matter of law. For example in Kijana vs. Republic (Criminal Appeal E275 of 2019) [2024] KECA 404 (KLR) (5 April 2024) (Judgment) this Court stated:-
“
.… It follows that whether the appellant’s rights were violated by being deprived the opportunity to be heard in mitigation or by not having his mitigation considered before passing of the sentence imposed against him, is a matter of law. We have said enough to affirm that before us are matters of law and therefore the bar erected by section 361 (1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot stop us from considering the appeal on sentence before us.”






7.
In this case, two hurdles stand on the way of the appellant’s appeal. We have read the grounds of appeal cited by the appellant in his appeal before the High Court, and it is evident that the appellant did not raise any ground against his sentence nor did he challenge the constitutionality of the life sentence imposed upon him before the High Court. He is raising it here for the first time in his submissions before this court, but he is precluded from raising new grounds at this second appellate stage.






8.
The other hurdle the appellant’s case faces is that recently, in a decision that is binding on us, the Supreme Court, in Petiti
on No. E018 of 2023
, Republic vs. Joshua Gichuki Mwangi and Others, affirmed the lawfulness of minimum/mandatory sentences in the 
Sexual Offences Act
 when it held that:-
“
(57)
In the Muruatetu case, this court solely considered the mandatory sentence of death under Section 204 of the Penal Code as it is applied to murder cases; it did not address minimum sentences at all. Therefore, mandatory sentences that apply for example to capital offences, are vastly different from minimum sentences such as those found in the 
Sexual Offences Act
, and the Penal Code. Often in crafting different sentencing for criminal offences, the drafters of the law in the Legislature, take into consideration a number of issues including deterrence of crime, enhancing public safety, sequestering of dangerous offenders, and eliminating unjustifiable sentencing disparities...
(62)
Before Kenyan courts can determine whether or not the above trends and decisions are persuasive, we reiterate that there ought to be a proper case filed, presented and fully argued before the High Court and escalated through the appropriate channels on the constitutional validity or otherwise of minimum sentences or mandatory sentences other than for the offence of murder. This was our approach and direction in Muruatetu which must remain binding to all courts below.”






9.
In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated herein above, we find that this appeal lacks merit. Accordingly, we dismiss it.

Accused










Sentence










1.
The accused was initially charged with the offence of Murder Contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code; upon a Plea Bargain Agreement being entered the Charge was then reduced to manslaughter;






2.
The Plea Bargain Agreement dated 29/05/2024 was adopted by the court upon it being satisfied that the accused had understood the contents and that she had executed it voluntarily without promise or benefit of any kind and without threats, force, intimidation or coercion of any kind;






3.
The particulars of the offence of Manslaughter c/s to Section 202 as read with Section 205 of the Penal Code are that the accused was charged with having unlawfully killed KELVIN KIARIE WANJIKU on the 14
th
 day of February, 2021 at Murengeti Village in Limuru Sub-County within Kiambu County;






4.
On the 24/02/2021 the accused confessed to having unlawfully killed her son aged 13 years; before confessing to the crime the accused had called her mother and informed her that the child was missing; this was followed by a report made to Githunguri Police Station and broadcasts on radio and social media as well as the conducting of a physical search;






5.
The body was found in a maize plantation; a Post Mortem examination revealed the likely cause of death as from being hit on the head with a blunt object; The Post Mortem Report was produced into court as ‘PExh.1’;






6.
The accused was convicted on her own plea of ‘Guilty’; Before sentencing both counsels were invited to make submissions in mitigation; hereunder are the respective submissions.






7.
Prosecuting Counsel for the State submitted that on the 24/02/2021 the accused had confessed to having committed the offence and had recorded her statement at the earliest onset; The prosecution submitted that the accused in accepting the Plea Bargain the accused had not wasted judicial time; it had no previous records of the accused and that she may be treated as a first offender;






8.
In mitigation Counsel for the accused submitted that the convict mourned the loss of her son and was extremely remorseful; her state of mind was disturbed by reason of her HIV status and her son was also afflicted and she wanted to ease his suffering and hers; on the grounds of the convict’s medical health condition Counsel pleaded and prayed for a pardon or a non-custodial sentence.






9.
The convict had been arrested on the 24/02/2021 and remained in custody to date and had therefore spent approximately three (3) years and six (6) months in custody; in the circumstances the period spent in remand was an adequate custodial sentence;






Analysis


10.
It is the duty of this court to impose a sentence that meets the facts and circumstances of the case; this court has considered the full circumstances of the offence which is contained in the Probation Officers Report; it was reported that the Convict had been previously married for a short while and upon separation with her husband he committed suicide by drinking rat poison; the report further states that when being interviewed it was observed that the convict was mentally disturbed and had suicidal thoughts; Even during the period she was remanded in prison she was placed under a 24 hour suicidal watch;






11.
This court has taken into consideration the aggravating circumstances in the commission of the offence in that the convict used physical force and a blunt object to inflict the fatal injuries on her child; after the unfortunate state of affairs she left the deceased for dead and proceeded to inform her family that the child was missing and to lead the authorities in the wrong direction knowing fully well that it was untrue.






12.
The mitigating factors taken into consideration by this court are that the accused readily pleaded guilty and thus saved the court on judicial time; the facts narrated by the prosecution took into consideration the personal circumstances of the convict that she had an existing medical condition in the form of HIV causing her to agonize on her condition as well as her sons as he was also afflicted; she has also expressed her remorse and found to have no previous record and is deemed to be a first offender;






13.
The offence of manslaughter is punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment; however, the life sentence has now been declared by the Court of Appeal in the case of Manyeso vs Republic [2023] KECA 182 (KLR) as being unconstitutional as it was held to be discriminatory, inhumane, and a violation of the accused’s persons right to a fair trial;






14.
In the light of the mitigating factors this court finds the convict is deserving of leniency and that such offenders generally require treatment and a non-custodial sentence; the convict has been remanded for a period of approximately three (3) years and six (6) months which period shall be deemed as term served.








Findings & Determinations


15.
For the foregoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
The period spent in remand of Three (3) years and months to be deemed as term served.
ii.
The convict be set at liberty forthwith unless otherwise lawfully held.
Orders Accordingly.

Appellant




and

Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgement of Hon J.A. Aduke, Senior Resident Magistrate delivered on 28th November 2022 in Milimani Divorce Cause No. E1288 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This appeal arises from a divorce cause in which the Appellant petitioned the lower court for dissolution of his marriage to the Respondent. In his Petition dated 25th November 2021, the Appellant sought a divorce on grounds of cruelty by the Respondent.






2.
Briefly, the parties got married in August 2002 under Luo customary law. Their union was blessed with 3 issues. The parties lived together until December 2020, when the Respondent left the country for a visit to the USA, never to return home. It was the Appellant’s assertions that this cruelty perpetuated by the Respondent had caused him untold anguish, stress and emotional trauma.






3.
The Respondent entered appearance but did not file any response to the Petition. The matter was certified ready for hearing and proceeded as an undefended cause.






4.
The trial court delivered its judgement on 28th November 2022. In dismissing the Petition, the court observed thus:
“
It is generally accepted that a court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks is likely to have happened in relation to the facts of the particular case. This is provided under section 119 of the 
Evidence Act
. In this instance, the question before me is whether or not the parties merit an order of divorce. To arrive at this finding, the petitioner has not implored the court to presume the existence of a marriage between the petitioner and the respondent. In essence the petitioner herein indirectly asks the court to declare that the respondent and petitioner were married for the court to then grant a divorce. This contravenes the provisions of section 3 of the 
Marriage Act
, which requires that all parties should register their unions under the Act. In particular, section 96 (2) and (3) of the Act requires that parties who cohabited before the commencement of the Act apply for registration within 3 years of commencement of the Act. A marriage by long cohabitation and repute was in the case of Hotensiah Wanjiku Yahweh -vs- Public Trustee can, therefore, be recognised under the 
Marriage Act
 by way of registration of the said union.”






5.
The trial court went further to refer to the case of Joseph Gitau Githongo -vs- Victoria Mwihaki [2014] eKLR. The Court also noted that at the trial, the petitioner relied on his pleadings on record in evidence and that the Petitioner (Appellant) statement did not make any references to an expert witness testifying and furnishing the court with information on the issue of fact of traditional marriage. The trial court, thus, found that the fact of marriage had not been proved on a balance of probabilities.






6.
For avoidance of doubt, the prayers that the Appellant sought in the Petition were:
i.
That the marriage between the Petitioner and the Respondent be dissolved;
ii.
Each party to bear its costs of the Petition;
iii.
Any further or other relief that this Honourable Court may deem just and fit to grant to the Petitioner in the circumstances






7.
Being aggrieved by this decision, the Appellant lodged the appeal on the following grounds:
i.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in declining to grant the prayers sought in the Petition dated 25 November 2021 being an undefended cause;
ii.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in departing from the facts as pleaded hence misdirecting herself on the facts of the case;
iii.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in purporting to frame a presumption of marriage between the parties whereas the court had not been called upon to do so;
iv.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in framing an issue of the existence of a marriage between the parties when the same had not been disputed by the Respondent;






8.
The Appellant, therefore, seeks the following prayers from this court:
i.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to allow this Appeal in its entirety;
ii.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to order that the Judgement delivered on 28th November 2022 by Hon. J.A Aduke SRM be set aside;
iii.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to order that the Petition dated 25th November 2021 be allowed in its entirety.






9.
Parties were directed to canvass the Appeal by way of written submissions. The Appellant filed his submissions dated 12th June 2024.






Applicant’s Submissions


10.
The Appellant submitted that the Petition having proceeded as an undefended cause, then the trial court erred in insisting that the Petitioner ought to have called an expert witness. Since the Petitioner’s averments remained unchallenged, it was not upon the trial court to descend onto the litigation arena and inquire as to whether the ingredients of a Luo customary marriage had been adhered to, the same having not been in issue.








Respondents Submissions


11.
On her part, the Respondent filed Respondent’s Declaration and Written Submissions, pursuant to Order 42, rule 16 of the Civil Procedure Rules, in which she stated as follows:
“
I declare that I do not intend, at the hearing of the Appeal, to appear in person or by an Advocate.
That I further submit that I do not oppose the Appeal on the following grounds:
a.
The marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken down;
b.
I did not oppose the Petition in the lower court and it proceeded as an undefended cause;
c.
I am advised in view of the saving provisions of Section 98 (1) of the 
Marriage Act
, the learned Magistrate misapplied the import of section 96 (2) and (3) of the 
Marriage Act
 in holding that the parties had to apply for registration of the customary marriage before a petition for divorce can be filed.
For the forgoing reasons, the Respondent prays that the Appeal ought to be allowed and the marriage between the parties dissolved as desired by the parties.”








Analysis and Determination


12.
It is now well established that the role of the first appellate court is to re-evaluate, re-assess and re-analyze the evidence tendered at the trial in a bid to reach its own independent conclusion. This principle was well captured in the case of Abok James Odera t/a A.J. Odera and Associates v John Patrick Machira t/a Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that:-
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyse the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way. See the case of Kenya Ports Authority versus Kuston (Kenya) Limited (2009) 2EA 212 wherein the Court of Appeal held inter alia that:-
“On a first appeal from the High Court, the Court of Appeal should reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in that respect. Secondly that the responsibility of the court is to rule on the evidence on record and not to introduce extraneous matters not dealt with by the parties in the evidence””






13.
The same principle was enunciated by the Court of Appeal in the case of Nation Media Group Ltd & 2 others v John Joseph Kamotho & 3 others [2010] eKLR where it was held that:-
“
It is trite law, and we accept Mr. Kiragu’s submission that this Court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below and that an appeal to this Court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this Court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowances in this respect. 
See Selle and Another v Associated Motor Boat Company Limited and others
 [1968] EA 123.”






14.
In a divorce cause, just as is the case in any civil cause, the onus of proving the existence of a fact generally lies on the party who claims it. The required standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities. Sections 107, 108 and 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 provide for the burden of proof as follows:
107:
Burden of Proof
1.
Whoever desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability depending on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.
2.
When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.
108:
Incidence of Burden
The burden of proof in a suit or proceedings lie on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side
109:
Proof of Particular Fact
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.






15.
With regard to marriages, Section 43 of the 
Marriage Act
, Cap 150 of the Laws of Kenya, provides the governing law for customary marriages as follows:
i.
A marriage under this Part 
shall
 be celebrated in accordance with the customs of the communities of one or both of the parties to the intended marriage.
ii.
Where the payment of dowry is required to prove a marriage under customary law, the payment of a token amount of dowry shall be sufficient to prove a customary marriage. (emphasis mine)






16.
Section 44 of the 
Marriage Act
 provides that parties to a customary marriage shall notify the Registrar of such marriage within three months of completion of the relevant ceremonies or steps required to confer the status of marriage to the parties in the community concerned. (emphasis mine)






17.
Section 45 provides for the contents of the notifications, namely:
(i)
a specification of the customary law applied in the marriage;
(ii)
a written declaration by the parties that the necessary customary requirements to prove marriage have been undertaken; and
(iii)
signatures or personal marks of two adult witnesses, each of whom must have played a key role in the celebration of the marriage.






18.
Once all these rituals are completed, parties are then required to apply to the Registrar of Marriages for registration of the marriage. The application may be done by either party within 6 months of the celebration of their union, whereupon the Registrar will issue a certificate, pursuant to section 55 of the Act.






19.
The enactment of this Act in 2014 placed upon parties to a customary marriage the mandatory requirements of registration of such unions within 6 months. The transitional provisions under section 96 provide a grace period for registration of those customary marriages that were contracted prior to the commencement of the Act, such as the case herein. Section 96 (2) provides that parties to a marriage contracted under customary law, the Hindu Marriage and Divorce Act (Repealed) or the Islamic Marriage and Divorce Registration Act (Repealed) before commencement of this Act, which is not registered shall apply to the Registrar or County Registrar to assistant Registrar for the registration of that marriage under this Act within three years of the coming to force of this Act. The effect of this provision, therefore, is that any customary marriage contracted before May 2014 had to be registered by May 2017.






20.
The reprieve came in the form of the Marriage (Customary Marriage) Rules 2017, which came into force in August 2017, through which, the Attorney General by invoking section 96 (3) of the Act, extended the period of registration by 3 years, ending on 31 July 2020.






21.
Turning to the facts of this case, the Appellant filed a petition in which he claimed the existence of a customary marriage between himself and the Respondent, which was celebrated in 2002 accordance with Luo customs. It is this marriage that he sought to have dissolved by the trial court. One thing is clear, that the burden of proving the existence of the fact lay on the Appellant, whether or not the issue was unchallenged by the Respondent. The Appellant was required to prove to the trial court that indeed there was a marriage that the court ought to dissolve. The question then lies: how does one prove the existence of a customary marriage in Kenya?






22.
This question is aptly answered in section 59 of the 
Marriage Act
, which provides as follows:
1.
A marriage may be proven in Kenya by-
a.
A certificate of marriage issued under this Act or any other written law;
b.
A certified copy of a certificate of marriage issued under this Act or any other written law;
c.
An entry in a register of marriages maintained under this Act or any other written law;
d.
A certified copy of an entry in a register of marriages maintained under this Act or any other written law; or
e.
An entry in a register of marriages maintained by the proper authority of the Khoja Shia, Ith’nasheri, Shia imam, Ismaili or Bohra communities, or a certified copy of such an entry






23.
In this instance, the Appellant did not provide any of the evidence enumerated at section 59 of the Act. Ostensibly, having overlooked the aspect of registration of his customary marriage, the Appellant was locked out from seeking a dissolution of whatever nature of union he shared with the Respondent. However, in my view, there is a clear distinction between the wording of section 59, as compared to other sections governing customary marriages. Unlike in the other sections, at section 59, the drafters used the word “may”, thus implying that the list is not exhaustive.






24.
Noting that a large number of adult citizens are married customarily, the strict interpretation of sections 44, 45, 96 (2), would mean that a vast majority of these unions are unrecognisable. The reality is that many couples who are married under customary law are yet to register their unions, either due to ignorance or for whatever other reasons. This would mean that there is no legal recourse for parties who feel trapped in such unions since they unable to prove the existence of such a marriage as per the provisions of section 59.






25.
Needless to say, it is from this ignorance of the requirement for registration that a lot of disputes end up in the courts, either as divorce proceedings, succession proceedings or even as property disputes. It is high time that civic education was taken seriously, to ensure that the public is enlightened on this and other legal provisions that may have serious ramifications extending beyond what appears on the surface of the dispute.






26.
Looking at this instant case, one wonders why the Appellant, having had his Petition dismissed and essentially being informed that he is marriage of 22 years is not legally recognised, would insist on pursuing an appeal. It is difficult to comprehend why the Appellant would persist with this cause, yet he has been “freed” from the union, the very remedy that he sought in the trial court. I would hazard a guess that this goes beyond the mere divorce cause. There may be other interests at play that may not necessarily be reflected in the pleadings.






27.
Turning back to the issue at hand, it would be ludicrous to inform two individuals who have lived together for the better part of their adult lives, gone through the rituals of a supposed marriage, held themselves out as husband and wife, borne 3 children and generally suffered and enjoyed the ebbs and flows of life together, that their union is not considered a marriage simply because they failed to register the same and get a certificate. Consequently, due to this lack of registration, the doors of the court are closed to them at the point when they wish to bring their union to an end. Equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy.






28.
In my considered view, the recourse for parties who are yet to register their customary marriages in proving the existence of their marriage would lie in the position enunciated in the case of Hottensiah Wanjiku Yawe -vs- Public Trustee [1976] eKLR, in which the Court of Appeal laid down the following principles:
(a)
First, the onus of proving customary law marriage is generally on the party who claims;
(b)
Second, the standard of proof is the usual one for a civil action (on a balance of probabilities);
(c)
Third, evidence as to the formalities required for a customary law marriage must be proved to that standard;
(d)
Fourth, long cohabitation as a man and a wife gives rise to a presumption of marriage in favour of the party asserting it;
(e)
Fifth, only cogent evidence to the contrary can rebut the presumption; and
(f)
Sixth, if specific ceremonies and rituals are not fully accomplished, this does not invalidate such a marriage.






29.
The upshot of the cited case is that the Appellant would need to prove the existence of a customary marriage, on a balance of probabilities, by demonstrating that all formalities required for customary law marriage were conducted. As observed by the trial court, this would require calling evidence of experts to testify as to the customs and traditions of a particular tribe and/or witnesses to the traditional marriage ceremonies and rituals. It is evident from the case herein that the Appellant did not do so. He merely adopted his witness statement which did not provide conclusive evidence of the customary marriage, thus calling upon the trial court to make a presumption that there was a valid customary marriage between him and the Respondent.






30.
A second option lies at section 61 of the 
Evidence Act
, which provides as follows:
No fact need be proved in any civil proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which before the hearing they agree, by writing under their hands, to admit, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings:
Provided that the court may in its discretion require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions






31.
In summary, to prove the existence of the customary marriage, the Appellant ought to have produced the documents enumerated at section 59 of the 
Marriage Act
, or called evidence to prove that the formalities of customary marriage were conducted, or an admission of the existence of the marriage by the Respondent. Notably, whereas the Respondent filed her submissions herein admitting the existence of the marriage, such admission was not forthcoming in the trial court. The Respondent merely entered appearance but did not file any Reply to the Petition nor did she testify.






32.
The upshot of this is that I concur with the trial court that the Appellant failed to prove his case to the requisite standard. As such, I find no reason to interfere with the decision. The appeal is hereby dismissed. This being a family matter, each party shall bear its own costs.

          (Being an appeal from the judgment of the Environment and Land Court at Kisumu (Kibunja, J.) dated 3rd July 2019inCase No. 131 of 2012)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant, Millicent Perpeture Atieno Wandiga, sued Vinit Sureshbhai Patel, Mayben Sureshbhai Patel, and the District Land Registrar Kisumu, the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents respectively, claiming that she was the owner of the suit property, Kisumu Municipality/Block/10/78 following the allotment by the Commissioner of Lands in 1978; and that she obtained lease thereto in 1981. She further claimed that, in the year 1990, the appellant’s neighbour, one Saeed Rauf Samnakay, encroached into her land and that she filed a suit which is still pending to date.






2.
She claimed that she got to learn that the property had changed hands to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents when she saw a new development come up on the suit property, without her knowledge., She alleged that the title changes had been done fraudulent.






3.
She, thus, sought orders for:
i.
A declaration that the transfers in favor of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents were procured by fraud.
ii.
An order that the title deed issued to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents be recalled, cancelled and revoked on the basis that it was procured by fraud.
iii.
That the land register be rectified to read Millicent Perpeture Atieno Wandiga as the rightful owner of land parcel number Kisumu/Municipality/Block 10/78.
iv.
That the house constructed illegally on land parcel number Kisumu/Municipality/Block/10/78 be demolished and an order of eviction be issued against the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents.
v.
General, exemplary, and punitive damages for fraud and trespass.






4.
The appellant’s contention was that the respondents committed fraud by transferring the suit land from her name without involving her; yet she still has title documents issued to her in 1981.






5.
The testimony that the appellant presented in court was that the suit property was allotted to her in June 1978, and she was eventually issued with a Certificate of Lease on 1
st
 July 1978; she used to rent out the land, and had deposited some fencing posts and building materials thereon; later on, a boundary dispute arose between her and her neighbour, Samnakay Rauf and she took him to court in 1990 in Kisumu Civil Case No. 103 of 1990. However, the case was never finalized. Later in the year 2021, as she was paying the land rates, she noticed that the receipt was issued in the names of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents, and realized that the property had been transferred to them.






6.
The appellant confirmed that she had obtained a loan of Kshs. 200,000/- from Barclays Bank using the title of the land as security; and denied entering into any sale agreement with Jagdip Morporia.






7.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents denied the appellants claim on the ground that they were bona fide purchasers for value without notice, for purposes of sale of a property situated within Milimani Estate and known as Kisumu Municipality/Block/10/78, having entered into an agreement on 4
th
 April 2011, with the then owner of the land, Zainul S. Velji and Jagdip Bhagwandas Morporia for Kshs.10 million without noticing any defect on title. Apparently the said vendors had bought the property from the appellant, who was selling it to settle a bank loan. The 2
nd
 respondent paid the purchase price and had the property transferred into her name and that of the 1
st
 respondent.






8.
She explained that prior to the agreement being executed she carried out a search and confirmed the said vendors as the registered owners. She thereafter paid all the sum expected including stamp duty of Kshs.400,000/-, registration fees and search fees all totaling Kshs.3,500/- and legal fees of Kshs.200,000/-. Due to the improvement on the land and the general appreciation, the 2
nd
 respondent honestly believed that the current market price of the property was in excess Kshs.35,000,000/-; and denied tampering with the records; also pointing out that the construction on the suit land commenced in 2010 and was done openly for two years without the appellant lodging any complaint.






9.
The 2
nd
 respondent further testified that following execution of the sale agreement, and after all necessary due diligence had been undertaken, and the requisite levies and taxes paid, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents were registered as joint proprietors of the residue of the leasehold interest in the suit property on 11
th
 May 2011 and a certificate of lease issued. The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents took possession of the property, had their development plans approved and commenced construction with no objections. They enjoyed quiet possession until the appellant emerged with a claim to the property in August 2012 or thereabouts, without complaining against the persons from whom the 1
st
 and 2
nd
respondents had bought the property and who she knew very well.






10.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents also filed a counter claim against the 3
rd
 respondent, stating that they had relied on documents of title issued by the 3
rd
 respondent as custodian of land records, that they had paid the registration and search fees and stamp duty in the honest belief that the documents were authentic. They further, urged that in the event of any impropriety in the process being found, then the 3
rd
 respondent ought to compensate them for the purchase price, stamp duty, legal fees incidentals totaling to Kshs.10,620,000/-. In the counterclaim, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents sought that judgement be entered in their favour for:
i.
Kshs.10,620,000/= with interests thereon from11
th
 May 2011 to payment in full.
ii.
General damages for fraud loss of bargain and loss of value of the property with interest thereon.
iii.
Costs of the counterclaim.






11.
The 3
rd
 respondent denied the allegations of fraud; and prayed for the suit to be dismissed. This respondent did not file a defence to the counter claim by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents.






12.
Zainul Velji, DW1, a business woman in Kisumu town, confirmed that, together with Jagdip, they acquired the undeveloped parcel from the appellant, who was introduced to them by one Barack, an estate agent. They got a copy of the title deed, carried out a search that showed the appellant was the owner. They then entered into a sale agreement dated 1
st
 February 2010, for a consideration of Kshs.2,200,000/-, and among the documents the appellant availed were copies of her identity card and a copy of the PIN certificate. They paid the purchase price as agreed; and this was confirmed by an acknowledgment; the appellant also gave them documents to confirm payment of land rates and rents; as well as a rates clearance certificate. The appellant also obtained consent to transfer the plot and the purchasers finally registered the transfer after paying the requisite fee; and ultimately, they were issued with a certificate of lease dated 10
th
 February, 2010. A year later they developed the property, with no objections either to the development or a challenge to their ownership.






13.
Eventually when the purchasers wanted to dispose of the property, they sent word out; and that is how the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents ended up buying the property from them at Kshs. 10,000,000/-.






14.
Upon considering the evidence on record the trial court found that the evidence showed that the appellant was the first registered owner of the leasehold interest over the suit property for 99 years from 1
st
 July 1978; that the allotment letter of 1
st
 July 1978 allotted to the appellant the suit property; and on 31
st
 August 1981 the lease was registered by the 3
rd
 respondent.






15.
The court also noted that the appellant had charged the title with Barclays Bank, for Kshs.200,000/= which was later on discharged; further that the certificate of title produced by the appellant did not have an entry about the certificate being issued on the proprietorship section or the charge being registered on the encumbrances section as is standard practice; thus leading to the question as to whether the certificate of lease produced was made from the original certificate of lease, when, as compared to the copy of certificate of lease produced by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents, the details noted missing from the appellant’s copy of lease.






16.
The trial court agreed with the respondents’ counsel that the appellant did not challenge evidence presented with regards to transaction over the suit land, as in fact the appellant was pointed out at the trial, as the person who sold and transferred the land to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents. The court also found that the respondent did their due diligence when buying the suit property; and that they were purchasers for value without any notice of defect in title.






17.
The court also pointed out that although the appellant pleaded fraud, she did not avail evidence to the particulars set out. The court held that the appellant’s allegations that the signatures in the sale agreement were not hers was not in itself proof of fraud and that she ought to have called an expert witness to confirm that the signatures were not hers. Further, that the appellant did not tender any evidence to show how any of the respondents tampered with the suit land records; and there was no evidence that the appellant had ever applied for certificates or other documents over the suit property that were declined. Had that occurred, the appellant would have availed copies of the applications and payments made thereof, or a reply from the Land Registrar on the matter.
The learned judge thus stated:
“
The totality of the evidence shows that the transaction between the plaintiff as the vendor, and Jagdip and DW1 as purchasers over the suit property, occurred. That transaction was not fraudulent, illegal or unprocedrural. That as the said Jagdip and DWl obtained good title, and have through the testimony of DWl confirmed that they transferred their interest to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 defendants, then the later acquired the title to the suit property legally and procedurally, and therefore have good title free from fraud.”
Consequently, it was found that the appellant failed to prove her case on a balance of probabilities and the suit was dismissed with costs.






18.
The appellant, aggrieved by the decision of the trial court, filed its memorandum of appeal dated 15
th
 August 2019 listing 13 grounds of appeal some of which are repetitive, but can be condensed as follows:
1.
The learned judge erred in law and in fact by: failing to appreciate and evaluate the evidence adduced before him by the appellant, particularly on the issue relating to fraud, and holding that the 1
st
 and the 2
nd
 respondents obtained a good title yet their predecessors in title had a clearly bad title; in relying on a witness statement whose makers were never called to testify in open court, thereby denying the appellant the right to cross examine; in holding that the defence evidence; in shifting the burden of proving the signatures to the appellant herein; relying on a photograph that did not at all resemble the appellant herein, and in relying on the evidence adduced by DW2 who did not have a valid power of attorney.
The appellant thus prays that the appeal herein be allowed and the judgment delivered on the 3
rd
 day of July 2019 be set aside and judgement be entered as prayed in the plaint in the High Court and the costs be in her favour.






19.
In her written submission, the appellant argues that she proved her case to the required standard; and maintains that the respondents engaged in fraud to transfer the suit property from herself to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents. The appellant also submits on the issue of the sale agreement between her and the 1
st
 and the 2
nd
 respondents, that the same was an afterthought, crafted to fit into the transfer process in favor of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents, owing to the fact that said agreement did not indicate who drew it nor was it dated.






20.
The appellant argues that the trial court erred in relying on the witness statement of one Barack Ogindo, who was not called to testify by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents nor did the appellant have a chance to cross examine him.






21.
On the issue of fraud, the appellant contends that the signature in the alleged sale agreement, as well as the signature on the acknowledgment receipts were not hers, as there was a lot of variances; and the signature in the sale agreement was not the same one as in the transfer form and in the letter of allotment in 1980. Based on the variance of the signatures, the appellant submits that the trial court was in error to conclude that an expert witness ought to have been engaged by the appellant to prove the veracity or lack thereof of the signatures complained of.






22.
On the issue of power of attorney issued to DW2, the appellant argues that the trial court erred in relying on her testimony, as the said Power of Attorney was not notarized in Malaysia, and as such DW2 had no valid Power of Attorney.






1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent’s submissions.


23.
On the issue of the filed witness statement of Barck Ogindo, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents submit that the court did not rely on the said witness statement as the conclusion of the court was based on DW1 & 2’s evidence and demeanor.






24.
As to whether the appellant proved her case to the required standard, the respondents answer that in the negative, maintaining that the appellant was given every chance to challenge the respondents evidence but did not.






25.
On the issue of fraud, the respondents submit that although the particulars of fraud were set out in the plaint, none of these grounds were proved.






26.
In relation to the issue of the Power of Attorney, the respondents submit that the same was produced without objection and that it was duly registered as required by law and was thus valid; that the appellant was unable to produce any evidence of payment of rates, which according to the respondents meant that she had no proof of the same as she had already transferred the suit property to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents.






27.
This being a first appeal and has been reiterated in several decisions of this Court, it is this Court’s primary duty to evaluate the evidence on the record in order to come to its own independent conclusion on the evidence and the law, as per rule 31(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules. This duty has been reiterated in Abok James Odera t/a A.J. Odera & Associates vs. John Patrick Machira t/a Machira & Company Advocates [2013] eKLR.






28.
The main issue to be determined by this Court is whether or not the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents acquisition of the suit property was fraudulent. The 
Land Registration Act
 is very clear on the issues of ownership of land. Sections 24(a), 25(1) and 26(1) are instructive. The law is clear that the Certificate of Title issued by the Registrar upon registration shall be taken by all courts as prima facie evidence that the person named as proprietor is the absolute and indefeasible owner and shall not be subject to challenge except on the ground of fraud or misrepresentation to which the person named is proved to be a party, or where the certificate of title has been acquired illegally, unprocedurally or through corrupt scheme.






29.
This Court in 
Munyu Maina vs. Hiram Gathiha Maina, Civil Appeal No. 239 of 2009
, held;
“we have stated that when a registered proprietor’s root of title is challenged, it is not sufficient to dangle the instrument of title as proof of ownership. It is that instrument of title that is challenged and the registered proprietor must go beyond the instrument to prove the legality of how he acquired the title to show the acquisition was legal, formal and free from any encumbrances including any and all interests which need not be noted in the register.’’






30.
It is not in dispute that the appellant was the first registered owner of the suit property and the lease thereto issued on 31
st
 August 1981. It is also not in dispute that the appellant charged the property with Barclays Bank of Kenya for Kshs.200,000/- which was later discharged. However, it is this charging of the suit property to the bank that brings into question whether the copy of the certificate of lease produced by the appellant was made from the original certificate of lease, thus bringing into question the ownership of the property.






31.
This Court agrees with the observation of the trial judge that the certificate of lease ought to have under the ‘Proprietorship Section’ an entry of when the certificate was issued or the charge being registered, and further on the ‘Encumbrances Section’ ought to have details of the charge and discharge of charge. However, the certificate of lease as produced by the appellant did not have these details, and oddly enough, the copy as produced by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents had the details on both sections correctly filled in, so logically the rational inference to draw is that the copy produced by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents was, indeed, made from the original certificate of lease to the suit property, which clearly shows the facility was taken by the appellant on 3
rd
 June 1992, discharged on 22
nd
 April 2003 and the re-issue of certificate of lease to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents’ on 25
th
 August 2003.






32.
The appellant, in her evidence, claims that she was not involved in the transaction leading to the transfer of the suit property from her name. However, the same evidence shows that the appellant did not even try to challenge the evidence presented by the respondents on how the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents obtained the copies of the certificate of lease, the appellant’s identity card and PIN. In fact, one of the witnesses, DWI Zainul S. Velji managed to point out the appellant in court as the person who sold and transferred the suit property to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents.






33.
The appellant also claims that the respondents, through fraud, managed to transfer the suit property from her name to that of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents and even goes ahead to list the particulars of fraud.
This Court, in the case of Demutila Nanyama Pururmu vs. Salim Mohamed Salim [2021] eKLR, quoting Vijay Morjaria vs. Nansingh Maddhusing Darbar & Another [2000] eKLR, Tunoi JA, as he then was, stated:
“
it is well established that fraud must be specifically pleaded and the particulars of the fraud alleged must be stated on the face of the pleading. It is also settled law that fraudulent conduct must be distinctly alleged and distinctively proved and it is not allowable to leave fraud to be inferred from the facts.”






34.
As regards the standard of proof, this Court has, in the case of Kinyanjui Kamau vs. George Kamau [2015] eKLR, stated that it is trite law that any allegations of fraud must be pleaded and strictly proved. In Ndolo vs. Ndolo (008) I KLR (G&F) 742 the court stated that:
“
…since the respondent was making a serious charge of forgery or fraud, the standard of proof required of him was obviously higher than that required in ordinary civil cases. In cases where fraud is alleged, it is not enough to simply infer fraud from the facts.’’






35.
The appellant cannot, therefore, be heard saying that “it was obvious” that the signatures were clearly different and as such there was no need to call in an expert witness to confirm the same.






36.
The Court of Appeal in Uganda, in Katende vs. Haridar & Company Limited [2008] 2 E.A. 173 as quoted by the Court of Appeal in Nakuru CoA Ap
p No. 291 of 2013
 Weston Gitonga & 10 Others vs. Peter Rugu Gikanga & Another [2017] eKLR, held:
“
for the purposes of this appeal, it suffices to describe a bona fide purchaser as a person who honestly intends to purchase the property offered for sale and does not intend to acquire it wrongly. For a purchaser to successfully rely on the bona fide doctrine, (he) must prove that:
i.
He holds a certificate of title.
ii.
He purchased the property in good faith.
iii.
He had no knowledge of fraud.
iv.
He purchased for valuable consideration.
v.
The vendors had apparent valid title.
vi.
He purchased without notice of any fraud.
vii.
He was not party to any fraud.”






37.
The evidence on record shows that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents bought the suit land from Zanul S. Velji & Jagdip Bhagwandas Morporia. This Court also notes that Zanul S. Velji, testified for the respondents’ as DW1, and as the trial court rightly put it the evidence of DW1 was emphatic and first hand as DW1 was involved in the sale and there was no reason advanced as to why he would lie.






38.
We take note, and concur with the trial court that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents carried out due diligence when buying the suit property; and had there been any defect the 3
rd
 respondent would not have issued title. It will be noted that the 3
rd
 respondent’s defence only disputed the appellant’s claim, but said nothing on the lack of legitimacy of the title issued to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents. There is no evidence that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents entered into the sale agreement with bad faith, or that they did not follow due process.






39.
From the evidence on record this Court finds that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents were bona fide purchasers for value, meaning that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents title is absolute and indefeasible; and said title should be shielded from being defeated as provided by section 25 of the 
Land Registration Act
.






40.
The end result, therefore, is that we find and hold that the appellant’s appeal lacks merit; as such there is no reason to disturb the judgment of the trial court. The same is dismissed with costs to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents.

Between




Bertha Naliaka Otwere


 


Appellant




and




Ramesh Kotecha


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the ruling of the Environment & Land Court at Kakamega (N. A. Matheka, J.) dated 21st June 2017 in Case No. 274 of 2015)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The ruling subject of appeal before this Court relates to the application dated 3
rd
 September 2015 seeking orders of dismissal of the appellant’s suit for reason of inaction on the part of the appellant as there has been no action/step taken in the case for over 6 years.






2.
The genesis of this matter stems from the suit Kakamega Environment & Land Court (ELC) No. 274 of 2015 filed by the late Justus Sabal Otwere t/a Otwere Miti Shamba Company Ltd (Justo), against the respondent, and Kakamega County Council. Upon his demise on 23
rd
 September 2004, he was substituted by his widow Bertha Naliaka Otwere, who obtained a limited grant for purposes of pursuing the suit. The substitution was allowed on 23
rd
 July 2009.






3.
The suit had commenced via a plaint dated 19
th
 December 2001 which was later amended vide an amended plaint dated 29
th
 August 2003. The claim was that the respondents had colluded to defraud the late Justo of a parcel of land situated in Kakamega Town Block 1/180 where Justo had lived and conducted business for over 35 years, hence predisposing him to be first in priority in the event of change of ownership of the land either by being disposed or allocated. He, thus, sought to be declared the rightful owner of the said parcel; and an order be made compelling Kakamega County Council to cancel or revoke the 1
st
 respondent’s registration in respect of that parcel, compensation for loss, by way of general damages and special damages.






4.
On 3
rd
 September 2015, the respondent filed a notice of motion, seeking that the suit be dismissed for want of prosecution citing the fact that for a period of 6 years, from 23
rd
 July 2009 to the date of making the application, no steps had been taken in prosecuting and concluding the matter. Vide his supporting affidavit dated 3
rd
 September 2015, the respondent argued that after the order was made allowing the appellant to substitute the original plaintiff, the appellant lost interest in the case and that the rights and interests of the respondent as the sole owner of the subject matter were adversely affected by the pendency of the matter, especially because the appellant had caused an inhibition on the title, yet she had no beneficial interest as an owner or purchaser.






5.
In contesting the application for dismissal, the appellant filed grounds of opposition in which she stated that:
a.
The application remained incompetent as the firm of Fwaya Advocates who filed it had no locus standi in the matter.
b.
The applicant acted in bad faith in that after filing the application on 9
th
 September 2015, he served it on the eve of the last weekend to the hearing being 2
nd
 October 2015, thereby denying the appellant sufficient opportunity to respond through appropriate affidavits to explain the delay in taking a hearing date.
c.
The delay was substantially caused by the non- availability of Environment and land court which was seized of the appropriate jurisdiction in the matter.
d.
The orders sought were not in the best interest of justice as the appellant was ready and willing to move the court for the hearing of the suit.
e.
The application amounted to an abuse the court’sprocess.






6.
The appellant also filed a replying affidavit in which she explained that her inability to fix the matter for hearing was due to the fact that there was no judge to handle land matters; and that Justice Mwita, who took charge for some time, was found by this Court as having acted without the requisite jurisdiction, so for that reason the hearing failed to take off for a long period.






7.
Vide a ruling dated 21
st
 June 2017, the trial court found that the issues raised in the statement of grounds dated 5
th
 October 2015 were irrelevant, that there were no attempts to explain the delay and that the allegation that the High Court did not have jurisdiction was not correct as the ELC court came into being in 2010 and as such no issues of jurisdiction could have arisen in 2009. The court went on to note that after 2010 there were judges in Kakamega and land matters were handled accordingly. The court then went on to find that the application had merit and allowed the same as prayed.






8.
This being a first appeal and has been reiterated in several decisions of this Court, it is this Court’s primary duty to evaluate the evidence on the record in order to come to its own independent conclusion on the evidence and the law, as per rule 31(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules. This duty has been reiterated in Abok James Odera t/a A.J. Odera & Associates vs. John Patrick Machira t/a Machira & Company Advocates [2013] eKLR.






9.
The appellant raises 5 grounds of appeal bringing out two main issues, namely:
i.
Whether the court erred in allowing the respondent’s application despite the same being served by a firm not properly on record.
The crux of the appellant’s case under this ground is that there is no notice of change and/or appointment of advocates filed and served by the firm of Gabriel Fwaya Advocates who filed the application dated 3
rd
 September 2015 which resulted into the impugned ruling and as such the application was a nullity ab initio.
ii.
Whether the court erred in failing to recognize that the matter in question had not been determined on merit.
On this issue, the appellant submits that Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 requires courts, while administering justice, not to put undue regard to procedural technicalities, and that all matters should be determined on merit and that dismissal of matters should only be exercised as a last resort where the matter is demonstrated to be hopeless or disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant argues that the subject matter being land, the same needed to have been determined on merit.






10.
The respondent on the other hand submits that on the issue of the filing of the notice of appointment by Fwaya Advocates, the same was filed on 3
rd
 September 2015 and was duly served. The respondent submits that the issue of representation was never raised by the appellant in the superior court and that a perusal of the grounds and submissions are silent on the issue.






11.
The respondent further submits that the application in the trial court was not to make a determination on merit over the subject matter but rather to determine whether or not the appellant had failed to prosecute the suit for a period of over one year, and if so, whether there were any good reasons for such failure.






12.
The respondent is correct regarding the first issue: the appellant did not raise the issue of whether the respondent’s advocates’ firm was correctly on record as an issue before the trial court. As such, the appellant did not preserve the issue for determination on appeal and cannot, therefore, raise it in this Court for the first time. Consequently, we hold the view that the sole issue for determination in this application is whether the appellant’s suit warranted dismissal for want of prosecution. We will now look at that issue.






13.
Order 17 Rule 2(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules, which governs dismissal of suits for want of prosecution in the lower courts, provides as follows:
In any suit in which no application has been made or step taken by either party for one year, the court may give notice in writing to the parties to show cause why the suit should not be dismissed, and if cause is not shown to its satisfaction, may dismiss the suit.
In addition, Order 17 Rule 2(3) of the Civil Procedure Rules, states thus:
Any party to the suit may apply for its dismissal as provided in sub-rule 1.






14.
Clearly, the statutory threshold set out under Order 17 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules is that a suit qualifies to be dismissed for want of prosecution: if no application has been made or no step has been taken in the suit by either party for at least one year preceding the presentation of the application seeking dismissal of the suit.






15.
In Civil Appeal Salkas Contractors Ltd vs. Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd, [2004] eKLR, this Court (Omolo, Okubasu, Onyango Otieno, JJA) acknowledging that in dealing with an application of this nature, the court is called upon to exercise its discretion; and the guiding principle to consider is whether discretion was exercised based on a wrong in principle or that the court acted perversely on facts and was clearly wrong in its decision. Drawing from the case of Allen vs. Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Limited [1968] 1 ALL ER 543, which enumerated the principles to be applied in a case seeking dismissal for want of prosecution either because of the plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Rules of the superior court or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction; for such an application to succeed, the party applying for dismissal must show: (i) that there has been inordinate delay; the inordinate delay is inexcusable; and (iii) the defendants are likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay.






16.
In Argan Wekesa Okumu vs. Dima College Limited & 2 Others [2015] eKLR, which is of persuasive status, the High Court considered the principles for dismissal of a suit for want of prosecution and stated as follows:
“
The principles governing applications for dismissal for want of prosecution are well settled and have been established by a long line of authorities. The applicant must show that the delay complained of is inordinate, that the inordinate delay is inexcusable and that the defendant is likely to be prejudiced by such delay. As such the 3
rd
 defendant in this case must meet the burden of proof in seeking the dismissal of the plaintiff’s case for want of prosecution see the case of Ivita vs. Kyumbu (1984) KLR 441. Further to this, the decision of whether or not to dismiss a suit is discretionary and this Court must exercise such discretion judiciously. Additionally, each case must be decided on its own facts keeping in mind that a court should strive to sustain a suit where possible rather than prematurely terminating the same.”






17.
Whether to exercise the power of dismissal for want of prosecution under Order 17 is, however, a matter that is within the discretion of the court. In its decision in Nilesh Premchand Mulji Shah & Another t/a Ketan Emporium vs. M.D. Popat and Others & Another [2016] eKLR, the High Court stated as follows:
“Nonetheless, Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 and Order 17 Rule 2(3) gives the court the discretion to dismiss the suit where no action has been taken for one year and on application by a party as justice delayed without explanation is justice denied and delay defeats equity. That discretion must be exercised on the basis that it is in the interest of justice regard being whether the party instituting the suit has lost interest in it, or whether the delay in prosecuting the suit is inordinate, unreasonable, inexcusable, and is likely to cause serious prejudice to the defendant on account of that delay. This is what the case of Ivita vs. Kyumba [1984] KLR 441 espoused that: “The test applied by the courts in the application for dismissal of a suit for want of prosecution is whether the delay is prolonged and inexcusable, and if it is, whether justice can be done despite the delay. Thus, even if the delay is prolonged, if the court is satisfied with the plaintiff’s excuse for the delay, and that justice can still be done to the parties, the action will not be dismissed but it will be ordered that it be set down for hearing at the earliest time. It is a matter of and in the discretion of the court.”(bold and underlined for emphasis)






18.
In Naftali Opondo Onyango vs. National Bank of Kenya Ltd [2005] eKLR, the court noted that a court should be slow to dismiss a suit for want of prosecution if it is satisfied that the suit can proceed without further delay. The court stated as follows:
“
However, in deciding whether or not to dismiss a suit under rule 6 it is my view that a court will be slow to make an order if it is satisfied that the hearing of the suit can proceed without further delay, that the defendant will suffer no hardship and that there has been no flagrant and culpable inactivity on the part of the Plaintiff.”






19.
Indeed, when the delay is prolonged and inexcusable, such that it would cause grave injustice to the one side or the other or to both, the court may in its discretion dismiss the action straight away, but substantive justice must be considered and weighed judiciously so as to balance the scales. In this regard, the case of 
Mwangi S. Kimenyi vs. Attorney General and Another, Misc. Civil Suit No. 720 of 2009
, the court restated the test as follows:
i.
“whether the delay has been intentional and contumelious;
ii.
whether the delay or the conduct of the plaintiff amounts to an abuse of the court;
iii.
whether the delay is inordinate and inexcusable;
iv.
whether the delay is one that gives rise to a substantial risk to fair trial in that it is not possible to have a fair trial of issues in action or causes or likely to cause serious prejudice to the defendant; and
v.
what prejudice will the dismissal cause to the plaintiff. By this test, the court is not assisting the indolent, but rather it is serving the interest of justice, substantive justice on behalf of all the parties.”






20.
From the record the plaint is dated 19
th
 December 2001 and filed the next day. There is a reply to defence and counterclaim dated 7
th
 November 2002 and filed on the same day. This Court also notes that there have been several interlocutory applications by both parties and rulings thereto from 2002 up to around the year 2017. The present application the subject matter of this appeal was fixed for hearing on several occasions 17/3/16, 15/6/16, 21/7/16, 7/11/16, (on these dates the application did not proceed) and on 4/5/16 parties decided to proceed by way of written submissions with a mention reserved for 29/5/17 for highlighting, and thereafter ruling was reserved for 21/6/17 when the same was delivered.






21.
It is clear to this Court from the record that the several applications did indeed stop the main hearing of the matter. This Court also notes that after 2010 only Judges appointed to the Environment and Land Court could hear and determine land matters. We are of the considered view, and concur with the appellant that this matter, like all other matters, need to be determined on merit. Having noted all the interlocutory applications, which certainly hindered the hearing of the main suit and also noting that the respondent too, had the mandate under Order 17 Rule 2(1) to take steps to set the matter down for hearing which it did not do, we are persuaded that the dismissal was not warranted.






22.
In conclusion, the appeal succeeds, and the trial court’s decision is hereby set aside. In allowing the appeal the appellant is ordered to take appropriate steps towards having the suit fixed for hearing within 30 days hereof. Should the appellant fail to comply with said order the appeal shall stand dismissed. Each party shall bear its own costs of this appeal.

Republic


 


Respondent










Judgment










1.
The appellant, Jeremiah Mukhasia, was the accused person in the trial before the Senior Resident Magistrate’s Court at Busia in Criminal Case No. 1320 of 2011. He was charged with the offence of incest by male person contrary to section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, No. 3 of 2006. The particulars of the offence were that on the 26
th
 day of December, 2010, at Lukhuna Village, Bukhayo East Location in Busia County, the appellant, being a male person, caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of J.O.W., a girl aged 16 years who was to his knowledge his niece. The appellant was also faced with an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The particulars of the victim, date and place of the alternative count were the same as that in the main charge.






2.
The appellant pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to full hearing. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial magistrate convicted the appellant and sentenced him to mandatory life imprisonment, according to the law at the time.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved by the decision of the lower court and filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence before the High Court at Busia
 via Criminal Appeal No. 44 of 2012
.






4.
The High Court (F. Tuiyott, J.) (as he then was) dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence in a judgment dated 15
th
 May, 2014.






5.
The appellant was, again, dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court and has lodged the present appeal. Acting pro se, he raised nine (9) grounds in his self-crafted Memorandum of Appeal, all of which impugned his sentence.






6.
The appeal was argued by way of written submissions by both parties. During the virtual hearing, the appellant appeared in person, whereas learned counsel, Ms. Busienei appeared for the respondent. Both parties relied on their submissions and provided brief oral highlights.






7.
First, the appellant decried the constitutionality of his sentence and relied on the Supreme Court case of Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic [2017] eKLR and this Court’s decision in Christopher Ochieng v Republic [2008] eKLR, where, he says, the courts held that mandatory minimum sentences are unconstitutional since they deprived courts jurisdiction to exercise their discretion on sentencing accused persons. In this regard, the appellant argued that the discretion of the trial court to mete out a sentence that was commensurate with the circumstances of the offence he committed was curtailed due to the mandatory minimum sentence provided for by statute. He further argued that the trial court failed to consider his mitigation and submitted that there were no aggravating circumstances to warrant a sentence to life, given the fact that the victim was not below the age of 11 years.






8.
Second, while admitting that he committed the offence, the appellant argued that at the time of the incident, he was ignorant of the law and was under the “influence of his culture” which, he claims, disregards children born out of wedlock, such as the survivor in this case. In any event, he submitted that he was remorseful and pleaded with the Court to give him a second chance in life, so that he could sensitize “the ignorant community on the rights of children and their protection in law.” Additionally, he argued that he was a first offender and was only 19 years old at the time of his arrest and was, hence, a young man with a long way to go in life. He also submitted that he is an orphan and had a wife and two children who fully depended on him as their sole breadwinner.






9.
Third, the appellant submitted that he has been in prison for the last ten (10) years and has undergone various rehabilitation programs while in prison. Hence, the skills he has acquired will enable him earn an honest living and live a life that is crime free.






10.
Lastly, the appellant submitted that pursuant to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, he was entitled to a discount of the time he was in custody during the pendency of his case. He pointed out that he was in custody from 26
th
 October, 2011 when he took plea until the day he was convicted, which is 29
th
 March, 2012 as he was unable to raise the bail set by the Court.






11.
Ms. Busienei submitted in conceding the appeal on sentence. Counsel cited our recent cases impugning the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and indeterminate life sentences. In particular, she cited the case of 
Maingi & 5 others vs. Director of Public Prosecutions & Another (Petition E017 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 13118 (KLR), in which Odunga, J. (as he then was) addressed the issue of the mandatory nature of sentences in the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and held that they impede the exercise of judicial discretion. She also cited this Court’s decision in Nyeri Criminal Appeal No. 84 of 2015 Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs. Republic (unreported), wherein the unconstitutionality of mandatory sentences was affirmed. Counsel further relied on this Court’s decision in Julius Kitsao 
Manyeso vs Republic Malindi, Criminal Appeal No. 12 of 2021
, wherein it was held that mandatory life imprisonment is unconstitutional due to its indeterminate nature which renders it inhumane and violative of the right to dignity of the person.






12.
However, in conceding the appeal on sentence, counsel urged the Court to mete out a severe sentence based on the circumstances of the case as evident in the testimony of the complainant, PW1. Counsel argued that the appellant did not show any remorse during his mitigation and only asked for forgiveness and a second chance in life. In particular, counsel asked the Court to consider the “shocking” contention by the appellant that children born out of wedlock are discriminated against to the point of being defiled in the appellant’s cultural setting. If true, counsel argued, this should be an aggravating not a mitigating factor as the Court should signal opproprium to such repugnant cultural beliefs. Ultimately, counsel proposed a term sentence of twenty- five (25) years imprisonment. She conceded that section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code should be applied in favour of the appellant.






13.
We have carefully considered the appeal, the submissions of the parties and the authorities cited in support of the appeal against sentence.






14.
We start off by noting our limited remit as a second appeal court. Our jurisdiction is limited by dint of Section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code to deal with matters of law only and not to delve into concurrent findings of the two courts below. See Samuel Warui Karimi vs. Republic [2016] eKLR. Severity of sentence, on its own, is regarded as a matter of fact by dint of that statutory provision. We, therefore, cannot revisit the sentence merely because it is severe, unless we are persuaded that in its severity or manner of imposition it violated 
the Constitution
 or the law.






15.
A brief summary of the facts in the present case are as follows. The appellant was convicted of defiling his niece (PW1) who was aged 16 years at the time of the incident. She testified that on the material day at about 6.00pm, her mother (PW2) sent her to fetch firewood in a swampy area which was about 300 meters away from their home. Whilst there, she met the appellant who beckoned her. She obliged and went to where he was. Suddenly, he grabbed her, covered her mouth with his hands, tore her track suit and panties, lowered his trousers and underwear to his knees and then put his manhood into her private parts and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her. While in the act, PW2 arrived at the scene and confronted the appellant. He was taken aback. He stood up, let PW1 go, then ran away leaving his cap behind. At the time of the incident, PW1 felt immense pain and she also bled. PW2 took her to hospital where she was admitted for one day and treated, as her vagina was torn. Thereafter, they reported the matter to the police. However, the appellant fled to Uganda and was arrested about ten (10) months after the incident occurred.






16.
Ms. Busienei was correct that at the time this appeal was argued our jurisprudence on mandatory minimum sentences and indeterminate life sentences had taken a new trajectory where this Court had issued a series of decisions impugning the constitutionality of both. The trend was attributable, if only indirectly, to the Supreme Court’s decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic, Petiti
on No. 15 of 2015
 (Muruatetu 1) and found expression in High Court decisions impugning the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences in the 
Sexual Offences Act
 in cases such as Maingi & 5 others vs. Director of Public Prosecutions & Another (supra) (Odunga J. as he then was) and Edwin Wachira & Others v Republic – Mombasa Petiti
on No. 97 of 2021
,Mativo J. (as he then was). However, in a recent decision, to wit, Republic v Joshua Gichuki Mwangi (Petiti
on E018 of 2023
) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR)(delivered on 12
th
 July, 2024), the Supreme Court has held that the mandatory minimum sentences in the 
Sexual Offences Act
 are not unconstitutional. Following the doctrine of stare decisis, this decision by the Supreme Court is binding on this Court and overrules the recent decisions of this Court holding otherwise.






17.
However, there is a second aspect of the sentence which the appellant complained against and which, the Joshua Gichuki Mwangi Case at the Supreme Court did not expressly address. This is the question whether a sentence of life imprisonment is unconstitutional due to its inderminate nature. This Court has so held in Julius Kitsao Manyeso v Republic Malindi (supra) and Evans Nyamari Ayako vs. Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2018. In both cases the Court held that mandatory life imprisonment is unconstitutional due to its indeterminate nature which renders it inhumane and violative of the right to dignity of the person. In the latter case, the Court translated life imprisonment to a term sentence of thirty (30) years.






18.
This aspect of the case – challenging the constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment under Articles 28 (on human dignity) and 29(f) (on inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment) of 
the Constitution
 - is different from challenging the sentence imposed as unconstitutional for fettering the discretion of the sentencing court on separation of powers grounds. However, the appellant has raised the matter for the first time on second appeal. As the Supreme Court reiterated in the self-same Joshua Gichuki Mwangi Case, this Court is deprived of jurisdiction to consider a matter which was not first raised at the High Court. Differently put, while this Court may consider the constitutionality of the indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment in a properly presented case, it can only do so where the constitutional question has been preserved for determination by this Court by first raising it in the High Court. The constitutional argument cannot be raised for the first time on second appeal.






19.
The upshot is that the appellant’s appeal fails and we must dismiss it. We hereby do so.






20.
Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
The Applicant has premised his application under the provisions of Articles 22(1), 23(1), 25(c), 27, 28, 50(2)(p)(q), 159(2), 160(1) and 165(3)(b) of 
the Constitution
 2010; he was seeking a review of his Thirty-five (35) year sentence to a more lenient sentence pursuant to Article 50(2)(p)(q) of 
the Constitution
; the application is also premised under the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code on the grounds that the period spent in remand was not taken into consideration and his sentence was not in line with the decision rendered in 
Jona & 87 Others vs Kenya Prison Service & 2 Others (Petition 15 of 2020
) [2021] KEHC 457 (KLR;






2.
The Applicant was charged and convicted for the offence of grievous harm Contrary to Section 234 of the Penal code in Criminal Case No. 907 of 2004 Githunguri Court. After a full hearing he was found guilty and convicted of the offence and the Githunguri trial court imposed a thirty-five (35) year sentence as opposed to a life sentence. Being aggrieved he lodged an appeal to the High Court vide HCRA No.175 of 2005 and lodged a second appeal to the Court of Appeal vide Court Of Appeal No.481 of 2007; both appeals were dismissed and the sentence was upheld.






3.
The Applicant now seeks a review of the sentence to a lenient one. At the hearing the Applicant was unrepresented and relied on his supporting affidavit which he briefly highlighted; Mr Gacharia appearing for the State was not opposed to the application but requested that the Githunguri lower court trial record be availed to assist this court in determining the appropriate sentence to be considered.






Applicant’s Case


4.
The Applicant submitted that this court was seized of competent jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter under the provisions of Article 50(2)(p)(q) of 
the Constitution
 2010; That he had been sentenced without due consideration of mitigation or the unique facts and circumstances of his case; he prayed to be granted a lenient sentence; and also prayed that the period spent in remand be taken into consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code;








Issues for Determination


5.
After hearing the Applicant’s submissions this court found the following issues for determination;
i.
Whether this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for review of sentence; and
ii.
Whether the Applicant can benefit from Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.








Analysis


Whether this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for review of sentence


6.
The Applicant after being unsuccessful on appeal has opted to file an application for revision under the provisions of Article 50(2)(p)(q) of 
the Constitution
 2010 which read as follows;
(p)
‘Every accused person has the right to the benefit of the least severe of the prescribed punishments for an offence, if the prescribed punishment for the offence has been changed between the time that the offence was committed and the time of sentencing;






7.
From the Applicants pleadings it is noted that upon conviction and sentence he was sentenced to thirty-five (35) years imprisonment. Section 234 of the Penal Code prescribes a life sentence and the trial court in exercising its discretion did not dispense the prescribed severe punishment and instead gave him the benefit of a lesser definite sentence. Being aggrieved he filed an appeal to the High Court which appeal was dismissed. He moved to the Court of Appeal and lodged an appeal which was also dismissed; both appellate courts when determining the appeal must have considered the propriety of the sentence imposed and dismissed the appeal and upheld the Thirty-Five (35) year sentence.






8.
The court notes that the sentence has already been reviewed by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal on appeal and the appellate courts upheld the lesser and definite sentence that was passed by the trial court; indeed in line with Article 50(2)(p) the prescribed punishment for the offence the applicant was charged with has since changed in that the Court of Appeal sitting in Malindi in the case of Manyeso vs Republic [2023] KECA 827 declared that an indeterminate life sentence is not only inhumane, it also was a violation of the offenders rights and therefore it was unconstitutional.






9.
The court’s considered view is that the applicant had the benefit of mitigation which then informed the trial court to exercise its judicial discretion leading to a lenient and definite sentence as opposed to the then mandatory life sentence;






10.
For those reasons this court is satisfied that this application for review of sentence to a more lenient one does not fit within the parameters of Article 50(2)(p) as envisaged in the Court of Appeal case of Manyeso vs Republic (supra);






11.
For those reasons this court is reluctant to interfere with the trial court’s decision.






12.
The second leg of the application relates to Article 50(2)(q) of 
the Constitution
 2010 and Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code; Article 52(2)(q) which read as follows;
“
Every accused person has the right if convicted to appeal to, or apply for review by, a higher court as prescribed by law”.






13.
The applicant seeks a review of the commencement date of the sentence under the aforesaid Article and Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads as follows;
“
(2)
Subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Penal Code (Cap. 63) every sentence shall be deemed to commence from, and to include the whole of the day of, the date of which it was pronounced, except where otherwise it is provided in this Code.
Provided that where the person sentenced under subsection (1) has, prior to such sentence, been held in custody the sentence shall take account of the period spent in custody”.






14.
In his supporting affidavit and in his oral submissions the applicant does not specifically state the date of his arrest; he merely states at paragraph (11) that
‘I pray that the period spent in remand custody be computed into the eventual sentence to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code’; at paragraph (6) he goes on to state that he has ‘spent twenty (20) years in lawful custody since the time he was arrested’;






15.
Nothing in the form of any judgments from any of the three courts that handled the matters were attached to supporting affidavit that would have assisted this court in making its determination on whether the courts had taken into account the period the applicant had spent in custody.






16.
This court can only exercise its powers of revision in cases of proceedings from subordinate courts. The scope of revisionary jurisdiction is limited to satisfying itself on the legality or propriety of the sentence that was passed by a subordinate court; This court reiterates that the applicant lodged an appeal to High Court and Court of Appeal and it is clear that both appellate courts considered the propriety of the sentence and their scope of consideration would include the application of Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in that a court is obligated to take into account the period the accused spent in custody before the sentence was passed.






17.
This court has no jurisdiction to review a sentence already reviewed by a court of concurrent jurisdiction; nor does this court have jurisdiction to review a decision of a higher court, which in this case is the Court of Appeal.










Findings and Determination


18.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds that the application does not fit within the parameters of Article 50(2)(p) and finds no good reason of interfering with the trial courts’ decision on sentence.
ii.
The application for review of the Thirty-Five (35) year sentence is disallowed.
iii.
This court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to review the commencement date of the sentence. For want of jurisdiction this application is not properly before this court and it is hereby struck out.
Orders accordingly.

Accused










Ruling










1.
The accused was initially charged with the offence of Murder Contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code; upon a Plea Bargain Agreement being entered this charge was then reduced to manslaughter;






2.
The Plea Bargain Agreement is dated 7/06/2023 was adopted by the court upon it being satisfied that the accused had understood the contents and that she had executed it voluntarily without promise or benefit of any kind and without threats, force, intimidation or coercion of any kind;






3.
The accused was charged with having unlawfully killed Ann Wamaitha Kiarie on the 12
th
 day of December, 2018 at Githurai 44 Area within Kiambu County; she was convicted on her own plea of ‘Guilty’ of the offence of Manslaughter Contrary to Section 202 as read with Section 205 of the Penal Code;






4.
At the hearing here-of, the accused was represented by Learned Counsel Mr. Munene whereas Mr. Gacharia was the Prosecuting Counsel for the State; both counsels were invited to make submissions in mitigation before sentencing;






5.
Prosecuting Counsel for the State submitted that by accepting the Plea Bargain the accused had not wasted judicial time; the facts are that on 12/12/2017 the Accused left home and went to sell vegetables she carried a basin and a kitchen knife to cut vegetables; the accused worked till 10pm and passed through Wakaness Bar and found deceased there; Daddy a cousin to Accused’s spouse was present and was selling drinks; he heard commotion and found accused holding a knife and deceased bleeding on right thigh; He grabbed knife from accused and got a motor bike to rush the deceased to St, Johns hospital;






6.
The accused was arrested and arraigned in court on 2/01/2024 and never enjoyed the benefits of bail/bond and had therefore spent six (6) years in custody; it had no previous records of the accused and that she may be treated as a first offender;






7.
In mitigation Counsel for the accused submitted that the convict was extremely remorseful and regrets the loss of the life; she was apologetic to the victim’s family; she pleaded for a lenient sentence and/or the period spent in remand be treated as an adequate custodial sentence;






Analysis


8.
It is the duty of this court to impose a sentence that meets the facts and circumstances of the case; this court has considered the full circumstances of the offence which is that there had been a long standing strained spousal relationship arising from his alcoholism; the deceased had picked a fight with the accused the previous day when found drinking with the spouse of the accused; in the ensuing melee the accused stabbed the deceased who succumbed to the injuries on the same day whilst receiving treatment;






9.
This court has taken into consideration the aggravating circumstances in the commission of the offence in that the convict use of a deadly weapon to inflict the fatal injuries; but a witness to the incident stated that it was the deceased who attacked the accused who in self defence retaliated leading to the unfortunate state of affairs;






10.
The mitigating factors taken into consideration by this court are that the accused readily pleaded guilty and thus saved the court on judicial time; the facts narrated by the prosecution reveal that the killing was not premeditated she has also expressed her remorse and found to have no previous record and is deemed to be a first offender;






11.
The applicable law on sentencing for the offence is found under the provisions of Section 205 of the Penal Code which reads as follows;
‘Any person who commits the felony of manslaughter is liable to imprisonment for life.’






12.
The offence of manslaughter was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment; the maximum mandatory sentence was usually reserved for the worst case scenario; but the Court of Appeal in the case of Manyeso vs Republic [2023] KECA827 (KLR) declared the mandatory life sentence to be unconstitutional as it was indeterminate, discriminatory, inhumane and a violation of the right to human dignity;






13.
The aggravating factors in this instance far outweigh the mitigating factors; the accused went to the Wakaness Bar to provoke the deceased whilst armed with her tools of trade, namely a kitchen knife; even though there was no evidence that the attack was premeditated the accused used the kitchen knife to inflict the fatal injuries; this court is thus satisfied that the accused is deserving of a deterrent custodial sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence so as to deter others from committing similar crimes; act as a d it is noted that the accused was arrested on the 15/10/2019 and granted bail on the 18/11/2019 and was remanded for a period of approximately one (1) month; this court therefore finds that this period to be an appropriate sentence.








Findings & Determinations


14.
For the foregoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
A custodial sentence of Fifteen (15) years imprisonment is found to be an appropriate sentence;
ii.
The period spent in remand of six (6) years be deducted from the sentence.




Orders Accordingly.

Ruling










1.
The Applicants were charged with the offence of Murder Contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code; they are accused of having murdered Lewis Makimei Ngari on the 5
th
 June, 2024. The applicants have filed applications for admission to bail pending the hearing of the Murder case which are premised under the Articles 49(f) and 50(a) of 
the Constitution
 2010.






2.
This court directed the Probation Office to prepare Pre-Bail Reports for all the accused persons; the same were prepared and filed in court on 23/07/2024.






3.
The parties were directed to canvass the applications by making oral submissions; hereunder are the rival submissions made;

 And 7
Th
 Applicants Submissions


4.
Mr. Kahiga counsel for the 1
st
,2
nd
 3
rd
, 5
th
 and 7
th
 accused persons submitted that the accused persons should be admitted to reasonable bond terms. That the accused persons have fixed abode as such not a flight risk and that they will attend court as required. He stated that the accused persons have been cautioned about the seriousness of the offence and the penalty imposed as well as being advised that bond is not the end to the means as the same can be cancelled and that they should adhere to the court’s terms religiously. It was submitted that facts as stipulated in the affidavits will be interrogated during trial, that some statements in the affidavits are mere allegations which have not been substantiated as such they are speculative and that interference with witnesses should be prosecuted by a court of law.








4
Th
 Applicants Submissions


5.
Mr. Kihoro for the 4
th
 accused person associated himself with Mr. Kahiga’s submissions. He urged the court to give the 4
th
 accused person reasonable terms. He contended that the accused is a family man and will attend court when required. That the accused has a young family that is dependent on him and that the children will drop out of school as the mother is unemployed. That the claim that the accused persons should be put in custody for their own safety lacks specificity in regard to the 4
th
 accused. That the claim that the villagers will attack the accused person is not true as they live far apart.








Respondents Submissions


6.
Mr. Gacharia, counsel for the state, submitted that the court should look at the victims concerns and balance the same with the rights of the accused. That the family is concerned with witness interference which is a strong ground to be considered in denying bail. It was submitted that in the event the court gives bond, the same should be equal to the task and that necessary conditions should be placed to ensure protection of witnesses from interference.








Analysis


7.
The applications were all opposed by the prosecution and having noted the contents of the two affidavits availed by the prosecution this court states that the right to bail has limitations and the same can be denied if compelling reasons are found.






8.
The averments in the affidavits confirm that the accused persons and the star witnesses are from the same village; This is a fact that has also been confirmed by the Area Chief; the Investigating Officer and a civilian prosecution witness have made averments under oath with the civilian witness stating that he has been intimidated and has received death threats from the accused persons; therefore it is the prosecutions contention that there is a possibility of the accused persons interfering with the witnesses; with a likelihood of suppressing evidence that may incriminate them;






9.
This court states that with the advent of the new Constitution 2010 times have indeed changed and that although the accused persons have been charged with a serious offence of Murder which carries a death sentence, the offence is bailable.






10.
The above notwithstanding this court reiterates that the right to bail has limitations and the same may be denied if compelling reasons are found; the state provided two affidavits that support the fact that apart from the 4
th
 applicant all the other Applicants and the nine (9) prosecution witnesses inclusive of the star witness hail from the same village; this is a fact that has been confirmed by the Area Chief in the Pre-Bail Reports; Two (2) of the Applicants namely the 3
rd
 Applicant (George) and 5
th
 Applicant (Daniel) are persons with pending criminal cases and are said to be out on bail; which means that having been charged with the instant offence they have breached their bail/bond conditions which require them to be of good standing and character during this period; having been arraigned in court leads to the presumption that they have engaged in activities that have brought their character into question leading to the arrest;






11.
The affidavit of the civilian prosecution witness made under oath is sufficient proof of a complaint on intimidation and threats having been lodged with the Investigating Officer. The Investigating Officer also averred that there are other accused persons who are yet to be arrested and there is that likelihood of the Applicants interfering with further investigations or suppressing evidence that may incriminate them;






12.
This court is thus satisfied that there is sufficient evidence that if the 1
st
, 2
nd
,3
rd
, 4
th
 5
th
 and 7
th
 Applicants are released there is a likelihood they will interfere with the prosecution witnesses and jeopardize their security;






13.
From the forgoing material placed before this court and in exercise of its discretion this court is satisfied that there exists compelling reasons to support the Applicants continued detention and denial of bail;








Findings And Determination


14.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations;
i.
This court finds that there are compelling reasons to deny the 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
, 4
th
, 5

, and 7
th
 Applicants admission to bail at this stage;
ii.

Respondent










Ruling










1.
The Claimant is an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya.






2.
She was employed by the Respondent as Legal Counsel/Company Secretary, in a contract limited to a term of 3 years, on 25
th
 September 2018. The contract was renewable. Her salary was Kshs. 220,000 monthly.






3.
She resigned on 6
th
 May 2021. The Respondent accepted her resignation on 10
th
 May 2021.






4.
Her terminal benefits were computed by the Respondent, at Kshs. 1,832,300. She did not dispute computation. The Respondent paid the sum in instalments, but stopped payment. A sum of Kshs. 1,313,300 remains unpaid, which necessitated the filing of this debt recovery Claim.






5.
The Respondent concedes owing the Claimant the sum pleaded, stating it is experiencing financial constraints. It is indebted to other creditors as well.






6.
The Claimant filed an Application on 20
th
 February 2024, asking the Court to enter Judgment on admission, in her favour; or, by striking out the Statement of Response and Counterclaim.






7.
Parties confirmed filing and exchange of their Submissions at the last appearance before the Court, on 10
th
 July 2024.






The Court Finds: -


8.
This dispute is unnecessary. The Parties disengaged consensually. There was no disagreement on terminal benefits payable. The Claimant even accepted payment through instalments. She received some payments through instalments. There is no reason by the Respondent to justify its unilateral decision, to stop paying the Claimant her full terminal benefits. Having financial constraints, cannot be a good ground, for denying a legal professional who has rendered faithful service, in accordance with the terms of her contract, payment of her terminal dues. It is over 3 years since she left employment. If the Respondent needed time, to arrange payment, that was granted, when the Claimant acceded to staggered payments. There was no reason for the Respondent to cease payments. When an Employee leaves employment, terminal benefits due, must be paid promptly, to enable the Employee plan for the hereafter. This Claim could have been avoided.
It is ordered: -
a.
Judgment is entered on admission in favour of the Claimant for the sum of Kshs. 1,313,300.
b.
The Statement of Response and Counterclaim are struck out.
c.
Costs to the Claimant.
d.
Interest granted at court rate, from the date of Judgment, till payment is made in full.

Claimant

Respondent










Judgment










1.
The Claimant filed his Statement of Claim, on 14
th
 October 2016.






2.
He states that he was employed by the Respondent on 12
th
 November 2012, as a Manager, Operations.






3.
He last earned a monthly salary of Kshs. 60,000.






4.
The Respondent terminated his contract on 8
th
 July 2016. There was no notice. His salary was not paid for 19 months, amounting to Kshs.1,140,000. He was evicted from his rental residence in Nairobi, and his Children sent away from school on account of unpaid fees.






5.
He prays for: -
a.
Reinstatement; or
b.
Gratuity;
c.
1-month salary in lieu of notice;
d.
Annual leave traveling allowance;
e.
Salary for days worked;
f.
Withheld salaries over a period of 19 months;
g.
12 months’ salary in compensation for unfair and unlawful termination; and,
h.
Costs.






6.
The Respondent filed its Statement of Response and Counterclaim, dated 29
th
 November 2016. It is denied that the Claimant was unfairly and unlawfully dismissed by the Respondent. He deserted on 8
th
 October 2015. The Respondent wrote to him on 22
nd
 January 2016, informing him that the Respondent considered him to be a deserter, and his contract terminated.






7.
He owed the Respondent a sum of Kshs. 215,000 by the time of his desertion.






8.
He carted away and converted to his own use, the Respondent’s construction tools and material including: bitumen sprayer; road measuring wheel; desktop computer with printer; 4 space workstations; 2 executive chairs; dumper logbook registration KBA 513 N; 5 assorted files; 1 old green survey machine; propeller; drive shaft; and an old clutch plate.






9.
The Respondent counterclaims return of the above items. There is no prayer counterclaiming the sum of Kshs. 215,000, and it is not made clear in the Respondent’s Pleadings, if the sum of Kshs. 215,000 is the value of the items listed above.






10.
The Respondent prays for dismissal of the Claim, and grant of the Counterclaim with costs.






11.
The Claimant filed Reply to the Statement of Response and Counterclaim, on 14
th
 December 2016. He denies that he owes the Respondent any amount of money. He explains that some of the items counterclaimed by the Respondent, were stored at the yard of Dogra Enterprises, after the Respondent was evicted from the premises it was occupying. The items are lying at the yard, uncollected. Others are held by the Claimant’s former landlord as lien, for unpaid house rent. The Claimant indicated that he would apply for preliminary dismissal of the Counterclaim. There is no record of such a Preliminary Application.






12.
The Claimant gave evidence on 13
th
 December 2022 and 27
th
 July 2023, when he rested his case. The Respondent did not give evidence, and closed its case on 26
th
 January 2024. The Court was informed by the Counsel for the Respondent that the Respondent’s only witness passed away. The Claim was last mentioned on 12
th
 July 2024, when the Claimant confirmed filing and service of his Closing Submissions.






13.
The Claimant relied on his Witness Statement, Documents and Supplementary Documents [1-11]. He restated his employment history and details of his contract with the Respondent, as summarized above, in his Statement of Claim. He was advised that work had diminished, and would be paid his dues later through M-pesa. He was not paid. He was not aware of any money owed by him to the Respondent. He returned all the tools of trade to the Respondent.






14.
Cross-examined, he told the Court that he worked from Kasarani in Nairobi. His supervisor Joshua Ndirangu was at the Head Office, in Karen Nairobi. The Claimant communicated with Ndirangu, through the phone. All staff at Kasarani left for Nanyuki. The Claimant was left with a staff of 2. He was in charge. He was a Mechanic, not a Manager Operations. He did not leave work voluntarily. He did not retain the Respondent’s car. He did not give away the Respondent’s properties to another company called Dogra. The items were stored at Dogra for security. The Respondent had been ejected from its leased premised by Zakhem Limited.






15.
He did not receive any letter requiring him to hand over the items claimed by the Respondent. He was not paid salary for 19 months. He survived over the period on family support. He did not desert, to work in greener pastures. He represented the Respondent for tender opening in Nyandarua County. Anyone, even a driver could represent the Respondent at tender opening. He reported the presence of some of the Respondent’s items in his house, to Kasarani Police.






16.
Redirected, he told the Court that his position was Manager, Operations. He was not told by the Respondent about retained items. The Respondent did not report him to the Police. Dogra kept the items. Tender documents were opened at Nyandarua on 2
nd
 March 2016. The Respondent alleges he deserted on 8
th
 October 2015. He signed the tender documents. He did not forge the exhibited documents. He had 3 different signatures.






17.
The issues are whether, the Claimant’s contract was terminated lawfully and fairly, or at all, by the Respondent; whether he merits the prayers sought; and whether the Respondent has established its Counterclaim.






The Court Finds: -


18.
The Claimant was employed by the Respondent with effect from 1
st
 December 2012, through a Notification of Appointment, dated 12
th
 November 2012.






19.
His designation was not specifically given. The Notification states that, ‘’your duties will be in operations and any other relevant assignment…’’






20.
In his evidence on 13
th
 December 2022, the Claimant told the Court that, ‘’ I was a Mechanic. I was not an Operations Manager…’’ Elsewhere, he pleads and told the Court that he oversaw operations at the Respondent’s construction site.






21.
He appears to have been a foreman, who oversaw construction works for the Respondent.






22.
Counterclaim: The Respondent is a limited liability company, and the Court did not quite understand why the death of one witness, would result in the Respondent being totally unable to give evidence.






23.
The Claimant closed his case on 27
th
 July 2023. The Respondent’s case was scheduled for hearing on 14
th
 December 2023.






24.
The Respondent did not turn up in Court and the Claimant’s Advocate, informed the Court, that he was told by his colleague that the Respondent’s Director had passed away. The Court adjourned hearing to 26
th
 January 2024, when the Respondent’s Advocate attended Court, and asked the Court to close the proceedings, on the ground that the Respondent’s witness had passed away.






25.
There is therefore no evidence to challenge that of the Claimant, or to support the Counterclaim, given by the Respondent.






26.
The Counterclaim is declined.






27.
Termination: There is no evidence by the Respondent to show that the Claimant deserted on 8
th
 October 2015 or any date thereafter. The Claimant is shown to have represented the Respondent at the opening of a tender in Nyandarua County, in early 2016.






28.
He was a foreman and granted wide latitude, in overseeing the Respondent’s construction sites and transactions. He had flexibility in his attendance of duty. He does not seem to have been closely supervised. He was entrusted considerable amounts of construction equipment and material. He determined where to utilize these, and decided where to have them stored. He was given a vehicle, and was not confined to a physical office, where he signed an attendance register each morning. When others were moved from Nairobi to Nanyuki, he was left with a skeleton workforce in Nairobi.






29.
Having been granted a wide discretion, in roaming about the Respondent’s construction sites, and having been the custodian of the Respondent’s construction equipment, it is not convincing that he woke up one morning, and abandoned work, leaving everything behind. He drove out in the construction sites, using a vehicle the Respondent had provided him. He was not confined to an office at Ruaraka. He was in Nyandarua to witness opening of a tender the Respondent was involved in, in early 2016. He is not likely to have deserted, at the end of the year 2015.






30.
There is therefore, no evidence that the Claimant deserted. Termination was instigated by the Respondent. It was not based on valid reasons, under Sections 43 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
.






31.
The Respondent pleads at paragraph 4 of its Response, that it issued a letter to the Claimant, dated 22
nd
 January 2016, indicating that the Claimant had deserted, and his contract terminated with effect from 8
th
 October 2015.






32.
The Respondent wrote various Internal Memos to the Claimant in quick succession, from 14
th
 October 2015, warning him about absenteeism. The Memos were internal, which suggests, that they were personally delivered to the Claimant. The one dated 23
rd
 October 2015, warned that absenteeism amounted to gross misconduct, and disciplinary action would be taken against the Claimant, in the absence of a written response, within 7 days.






33.
The letter terminating the Claimant’s contract, unlike the Internal Memos, was addressed to the Claimant, through a postal address at a place called Kiptangwanyi. The Respondent does not explain why there was variance on the mode of communication of the warnings and the letter of termination, but it is clear from these communications that the Claimant was within the reach of the Respondent, and a disciplinary hearing ought to have been convened, before the decision to terminate his contract, was made.






34.
Procedure was not in conformity with Sections 41 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
.






35.
Remedies: The Counterclaim is declined.






36.
It is declared that termination of the Claimant’s contract was initiated by the Respondent, and was not founded on valid reason, or executed fairly.






37.
The remedy of reinstatement is not legally permissible, termination having taken place in 2016. It is neither reasonable, nor practicable.






38.
There is no support in evidence for the prayers on gratuity, annual leave traveling allowance, and pay for days worked. The Claimant did not draw the attention of the Court to any contractual clause or legal provision, granting him gratuity and leave traveling allowance. He did not specify how many days he worked without being paid, to warrant the prayer for ‘’ pay for days worked.’’






39.
His salary was Kshs. 60,000. He is allowed the prayer for notice, at Kshs. 60,000.






40.
He did not specify in his evidence during which month, of which year, his salary was not paid, resulting in arrears of 19 months’ salary. He appears to have been entrusted the Respondent’s equipment, including a vehicle, which he used beyond his call of duty. He even entered into some form of agreement which is exhibited, where he allowed his landlord to retain as security, until all his rent arrears were paid. It is not likely that such an Employee would be owed salary for 19 months, and not have equally creative means of self-help, in recovering his arrears of salary from his Employer. His prayer for salary of 19 months is declined.






41.
The Court is satisfied that termination was unfair, and allows the prayer for compensation, equivalent of 12 months’ salary, at Kshs. 720,000. Maximum compensation because, the Claimant did not cause or contribute to the circumstances leading to termination; there is no evidence at all from the Respondent to challenge this assessment; he prayed for reinstatement which is unavailable due to a provision of the law; and he worked for the Respondent for over 10 years.






42.
Costs to the Claimant.
In sum, it is ordered: -
a.
The Counterclaim is declined.
b.
It is declared that termination of the Claimant’s contract was initiated by the Respondent and was unfair and unlawful.
c.
The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant: notice at Kshs. 60,000; and equivalent of 12 months’ salary in compensation for unfair termination at Kshs. 720,000 – total Kshs. 780,000.
d.
Costs to the Claimant.

Ruling










1.
Through a ruling delivered on 29
th
 September 2021, this court ordered that a grant issue to the respondent herein. Consequently, she filed summons dated 14
th
 February 2022 seeking confirmation of grant. The application is supported by an affidavit in which the respondent proposed that the whole of parcel number Kyeni/Kigumo/1592 bequeath to her.






2.
The 2
nd
 protestor filed a replying affidavit dated 01
st
 August 2022 and an affidavit of protest dated 11
th
 April 2023 whose contents are identical, stating that the summons for confirmation was filed outside the window of 21 days allowed by the court in its ruling delivered on 29
th
 September 2021. That the summons was also not served upon the beneficiaries thus she denied them a chance to participate in the proceedings. It was his case that the land should be share amongst all the beneficiaries of the estate and not just herself.






3.
During hearing of the protest, the court took viva voce evidence.






4.
PW1 was the 2
nd
 protestor who stated that he wished to rely on the contents of his affidavit of protest. He proposed that the land be distributed equally amongst all the children of the deceased. On cross-examination, he stated that the deceased gave land to the respondent’s deceased husband and his family has been living on it for 10 years and before the deceased died. That he was also given land but he later moved out after the deceased gave him another portion. That the deceased was also residing on the suit land and his only sister who is alive lives with her husband. That neither his brother the late Philip Kilonzo nor his children live on the land.






5.
DW1 was the petitioner/respondent who stated that she proposes that the land be given to her in place of her late husband. That the 2
nd
 protestor does not live on the land since he had already received land from the deceased. That before his death, the deceased gave her husband the land they now reside on and that the deceased lived with them before he died. That the deceased was buried on the suit land and that Philip Kilonzo lives in Ukambani on another piece of land. On cross-examination, she stated that she listed 3 of the 5 children of the deceased as beneficiaries of the estate. She did not produce any documents for the land and she does not know the parcel numbers for the land parcel given by the deceased to the 2
nd
 protestor. She stated that the deceased gave her husband another piece of land because he took care of him when he got sick. That the protestors have never stayed on the land.






6.
The court directed the parties to file their written submissions but only the 2
nd
 protestor complied.






7.
It was the 2
nd
 protestor’s submission that the 1
st
 protestor passed away before the protest was heard. That the deceased was survived by the following beneficiaries:
a.
Timothy Mutua (deceased but has children);
b.
David Kaminda (deceased and was survived by the respondent);
c.
Sepheth Joshua (deceased);
d.
Andrew Muchiri Munyi;
e.
Philip Kilonzo (deceased but has children);
f.
Salome Kanini (deceased);
g.
Rael Ndunge (deceased);
h.
Betty Muthanje; and
i.
Martha Mumo






8.
It was his argument that the respondent should not be allowed to inherit all the land by herself because she is the second wife of his brother and that the legitimate children of the deceased risk being disinherited. He submitted that the land should be divided amongst the children of the deceased in accordance with section 38 of the 
Law of Succession Act
.






9.
The issue for determination is how the estate should be distributed.






10.
The estate of the deceased comprises of parcel number Kyeni/Kigumo/1592 which was re-established through the ruling of this court delivered on 29
th
 September 2021. In the summons for confirmation, the petitioner named herself as the only beneficiary of the estate of the deceased. However, the protestors argued that the deceased had several children, some of whom are now deceased but were survived by children.






11.
The list of beneficiaries as stated by the 2
nd
 protestor has not been contested except to the extent that the petitioner said that the children of the deceased do not reside on the said land. In her testimony, DW1, the petitioner stated that she omitted the names of some of the beneficiaries. In the absence of a spouse(s) of the deceased, distribution of this estate shall be guided by section 38 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 which provides as follows:
“
Where an intestate has left a surviving child or children but no spouse, the net intestate estate shall, subject to the provisions of sections 41 and 42, devolve upon the surviving child, if there be only one, or shall be equally divided among the surviving children.”






12.
That being the case, the court finds merit in the protest and the same is hereby allowed. The following orders to issue:
1.
The estate of the deceased is to be distributed as follows:
Parcel number Kyeni/Kigumo/1592 to be distributed in equal shares amongst the following:
i.
Timothy Mutua (deceased but has children);
ii.
David Kaminda (deceased and was survived by the respondent);
iii.
Sepheth Joshua (deceased)
iv.
Andrew Muchiri Munyi
v.
Philip Kilonzo (deceased but has children);
vi.
Salome Kanini (deceased);
vii.
Rael Ndunge (deceased);
viii.
Betty Muthanje; and
ix.
Martha Mumo
2.
The portion of the estate that is due to deceased beneficiaries shall be held by their respective estates through the duly appointed administrators; and
3.
There shall be orders as to costs.






13.
It is so ordered.

and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Kakamega (Majanja, J.) dated 15th November 2017inHCCRA NO. 56 of 2016


Criminal Appeal 56 of 2016

          )
        
      






Judgment










1.
Rajab Senelwa Abdallah, the appellant, was charged alongside Joseph Oduko Rajab and Evans Osango Omido, at Hamisi Senior Principal Magistrate’s Court, with the offence of robbery with violence contrary to section 296(2) of the Penal Code. The appellant and two others were also charged with gang rape and indecent act with a woman contrary to section 10 and section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 respectively. The co-accused were acquitted on all charges while the appellant was acquitted on the rape charge, but convicted on the principal charge of robbery with violence.






2.
The offence occurred on 20
th
 March at Lyaduywa village, Lyaduywa Sub location in Vihiga County, when the appellant, jointly with his co accused, while armed with offensive weapons namely pangas, metal bars and hammers robbed Patrick Ndimuli of 50 kg of sugar, two mobile phones make Nokia 1110 and Alcatel, one dozen Kifaru matches, 10 pieces of 100gm Blue band, one dozen close up, five 500gm Chipsy cooking fat, three 500ml Popco cooking fat, one dozen mariandazi baking powder, one dozen tiptop milking jelly, six pieces of Geisha soap, fifteen sachets 15gm tea leaves, five pieces of Lido bar soap, 12 sachets of Omo, 10 tissue papers, 3 pieces of sunlight soap, Kshs.5,000/=in cash and two 1kg Jambo maize flour all valued at Kshs.30, 000/=. At the time of the robbery actual violence was used. The appellant denied the charge.






3.
He also faced an alternative charge of handling stolen property contrary to section 322 (1) of the Penal Code, that on the same date and place, other than in the course of stealing, he received 50kg of sugar, one mobile phones make Alcatel, one dozen Kifaru matches, 10 pieces of 100gm Blue band, one dozen Close Up, five 500gm Chipsy cooking fat, three 500ml Popco cooking fat, one dozen mariandazi baking powder, one dozen tiptop jelly, six pieces of Geisha soap, fifteen sachets 15gm tea leaves, five pieces of Lido bar soap, 12 sachets of Omo, 10 tissue papers, 3 pieces of sunlight soap, Kshs.5,000/=in cash and two packets of 1kg Jambo maize flour all valued at Kshs.30, 000/-, knowing or having reason to believe them to be stolen property. He denied this charge as well.






4.
The trial court after carefully considering the evidence, was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and found the appellant guilty on the charge of robbery, and sentenced him to death.






5.
Aggrieved by the outcome, the appellant appealed to the High Court, against both the conviction and sentence; faulting the evidence relied on with regard to identification; lack of an inventory form to prove the alleged recovery of the items; failure to prove ownership of the alleged exhibits produced in court;
the trial court’s failure to consider an alleged grudge that existed between the arresting officer and the appellant, which according to the appellant must have instigated the fabrication of the charge; and the trial court erroneously rejecting his sworn defence without giving cogent reasons.






6.
The High Court, having reconsidered and evaluated the evidence on record, held that failure to compile an inventory of recovered items was a procedural step which did not prejudice the appellant in any way; and the appellant was found in possession of recently stolen goods, for which he could not offer a proper explanation. The conviction was thus upheld as being based on sound evidence.






7.
We have carefully considered the record of appeal, submissions by counsel, the authorities cited and the law. This Court is mindful of its duty as a second appellate court, namely that the appeal must only be confined to points of law; and this Court will not interfere with concurrent findings of the two courts below, unless the finding is based on no evidence. The test to be applied on a second appeal is whether there was any evidence on which the trial court could find as it did. See Karingo & 2 Others v Republic [1982] eKLR.






8.
The evidence at the trial was that, PW1, Patrick Indimuli owned a shop selling assorted consumer goods. On the night of 30
th
 March 2012 while at home with his wife Phoebi Kendi, PW3, there was a knock at the door which was open, and 6 people got into the house and put off the lantern. The intruders had torches; and three of them had their faces covered. The assailants took PW1 and PW3 into the bedroom and demanded for money and their phones, while threatening to kill them. PW1 gave them Kshs.5,000/= as well as his phone. The assailants cut PW1 on his back and proceeded to rape PW3 in his presence. PW1 was then frog marched to his shop about 500m away where they met PW2, Edward Nyavanga, who was sleeping in the shop. PW1 further testified that after the assailants had removed the goods from the shop they locked him in the latrine together with PW3.






9.
PW2, testified that on the said date, he was sleeping when he heard someone attempt to open the padlock. He woke up and opened the door, and saw several people with torches. They blocked his mouth, tied his hands and legs while threatening to kill him. Both PW1 & PW2 saw the assailants taking coins and removing assorted goods from the shop, and they also recall that the other assailants kept referring to one who was leading the group as ‘Corporal Rono.’






10.
PW5, Corporal Ben Oruka, an officer at Kegondi AP Post received the report of the robbery from PW1 & PW3, both of whom were injured and he advised them to go to hospital as he and a colleague visited the scene. On 20
th
 March 2013, he received information that some goods had been found in a certain house under suspicious circumstances. At about 9 am he went to the house and found the appellant with assorted goods which were taken to the police station. The appellant was arrested and PW1 was able to identify the goods recovered at the police station.






11.
The clinical officer Susan Korir (PW6), testified that she examined PW3 on 19
th
 March 2013, and confirmed that she had been injured and raped. She also examined PW1 and noted that PW1’s face had injuries and was swollen, he was complaining of chest pains and pains along the spinal area, and his legs were swollen. PW6 classified his injuries as harm.






12.
In his sworn defence the appellant told the trial court that on 20
th
 March 2013 at 8am, PW5 (with whom he alleged to have had a grudge over a woman), and another officer went to his home arrested him, and later on he was charged.






13.
The High Court in its judgment pointed out that proof of any one of the ingredients of robbery with violence was sufficient to establish the offence under section 296(2) of the Penal Code. The learned judge was satisfied that a robbery did take place as corroborated by the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3; that the prosecution’s case was grounded on direct evidence of identification in difficult circumstances and the doctrine of recent possession; that both PW1 and PW2 admitted that the incident took place in the dark, yet they did not testify as to how they identified the appellant, nor was it clear whether they knew him prior to the incident; and no identification parade was conducted. The Court found that the circumstances were not favorable for identification, thus leaving the prosecution’s case to be hinged solely on the doctrine of recent possession.






14.
The court noted the testimony of PW1, 2 and 3, as to how the assailants robbed PW1’s shop and stole an assortment of goods including mobile phones. PW5 testified that he recovered an assortment of goods at the appellant’s house the very next day, which goods were subsequently identified by PW1 as part of his stolen ones. On cross examination, PW5 maintained that the appellant did not own a shop.






15.
In his defence, the appellant did not give an explanation as to why he had such a large assortment of consumer goods when he did not own a shop nor lay claim to any of the items. The learned judge also noted that the appellant admitted that PW5 went to his home on 20
th
 March 2013. The appellant also complained that there was no inventory of recovered items, but the High Court dismissed this argument finding that preparation of inventory was procedural and was not necessary for as long as the recovery and chain of evidence established that the items in court were the ones recovered.






16.
In the final analysis the High Court held that the evidence of recent possession was proved by the prosecution, and pointed to the appellant as the culprit. Having considered all the evidence in totality, the High Court found the appellant guilty of the offence of robbery with violence, and affirmed the conviction and sentence of the lower court.






17.
Although the appellant, in his submissions, indicates that he has raised 9 grounds of appeal related to conviction and sentencing we have not had sight of the memorandum of appeal, and the two documents supplied are titled supplementary grounds of appeal condensing the grounds to issues of identification, and sentence.






18.
The appellant submits that he was not positively identified by the prosecution’s witness. This Court notes that the High Court did, indeed, find the identification by PW1, PW2 and PW3 to be unfavourable as the incident took place in the dark and that the witnesses did not testify to knowing the appellant prior to the incident, despite them stating that he was referred to as ‘Corporal Rono’ during the incident.






19.
From the onset, and without belabouring the point, the learned judge acknowledged that the evidence on identification was wanting, and had no leg on which to stand. We can safely state that the conviction of the appellant was not based on identification, and does not warrant our consideration.






20.
On the issue of sentencing, the appellant submits that the death sentence was unlawful, harsh and excessive. He contends that the death sentence meted is unconstitutional and amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.






21.
The offence of robbery with violence is provided for under sections 295 and 296(2) of the Penal Code as follows:
295. Any person who steals anything, and, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of stealing it, uses or threatens to use actual violence to any person or property in order to obtain or retain the thing stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen or retained, is guilty of the felony termed robbery.
296 (2) If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death.






22.
In Johana Ndungu v Republic [1996] eKLR this Court explained the offence of Robbery with violence as follows:
“
In order to appreciate properly as to what acts constitute an offence under section 296 (2) one must consider the sub-section in conjunction with section 295 of the Penal Code. The essential ingredient of robbery under section 295 is use of or threat to use actual violence against any person or property at or immediately before or immediately after to further in any manner the act of stealing. Therefore, the existence of the afore-described ingredients constituting robbery are pre-supposed in the three sets of circumstances prescribed in section 296 (2) which we give below and any one of which if proved will constitute the offence under the sub-section:
1.
If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or
2.
If he is in company with one or more other person or persons, or
3.
If, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other violence to any person.”






23.
The elements of the crime of robbery with violence were set out by the court of appeal in the Case of Oluoch vs. Republic [1958] KLR. In the case of Dima Denge Dima & Others vs. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 300 of 2007 stated:
‘The elements of the offence under section 296(2) are three and they are to not be read conjunctively, but disjunctively. One element is sufficient to find an offence of robbery with violence.’
Taking into consideration that the High Court found the circumstances for identification to be unfavorable for conviction, this court must now determine whether the High Court was correct in convicting the appellant on the doctrine of recent possession.






24.
This Court has summarized the essential elements on the doctrine of recent possession in Eric Otieno Arum vs. Republic KSM CA Criminal Appeal No. 85 of 2005 [2006] eKLR:
“
Before a court of law can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis for conviction, the possession must be positively proved. There must be proof that first the property was found with the suspect, secondly that the property is positively the property of the complainant, and thirdly the property was stolen from the complainant…’’
Once the primary facts are established, the appellant bears the evidential burden to provide a reasonable and/or plausible explanation for the possession. (See 
Paul Mwita Robi vs. Republic KSM Criminal Appeal No. 200 of 2008
). This Court agrees with the trial judge that the prosecution did establish the primary facts as set out in the Arum Case (supra) and further that the appellant did not have an explanation and/or plausible explanation why the stolen goods were in his house when he did not run a shop or have some sort of claim to the said unusually large consignment of consumer goods. We find that the learned judge aptly considered and evaluated the circumstances, and correctly applied the doctrine of recent possession.






25.
On the issue of sentence, the appellant relies on the Supreme Court decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic, Petiti
on No. 15 of 2015
 [2017] eKLR, wherein the mandatory death sentence was declared unconstitutional. The appellant argues that the death sentence imposed is not only inimical to international law and customs but also unfair, as it took away his inherent right to dignity contrary to Article 28 of 
the Constitution
; cruel and inhuman punishment contrary under Article 25 to Article 29 of 
the Constitution
, so the sentence should not be upheld. Further, that he was not given an opportunity to tender his plea in mitigation before sentence.






26.
The respondent, on the other hand, contends that Section 296(2) of the Penal Code prescribes the death penalty for the offence of robbery with violence, and that although there were conflicting decisions on whether a court could depart from the mandatory sentence, the Supreme Court had given directions in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic, Petition No. 15 & 16 (Consolidated) of 2015, commonly referred to as Muruatetu 2, wherein the Supreme Court asserted that the decision in Muruatetu 1 was not intended to apply to all cadre of cases of mandatory minimum or maximum sentences. We are, thus, urged to find that the sentence of death imposed upon the appellants was in accordance with the law, and was neither excessive nor illegal.






27.
Our reading of the Supreme Court’s directions in 
Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic; Katiba Institute & 4 Others (Amicus Curiae) (Petition 15 & 16 of 2015
) [2021] KESC 31 (KLR) (6 July 2021) (Directions) (Muruatetu 2), is that its initial decision in Muruatetu 1 only applied to the mandatory death sentence for the offence of murder under sections 203 as read with section 204 of the Penal Code. It succinctly states that:
“
…, this Court’s decision in Muruatetu, did not invalidate mandatory sentences or minimum sentences in the Penal Code, the 
Sexual Offences Act
 or any other statute…
(15)
To clear the confusion that exists with regard to the mandatory death sentence in offences other than murder, we direct in respect of other capital offences such as treason under Section 40 (3), robbery with violence under Section 296 (2), and attempted robbery with violence under Section 297 (2) of the Penal Code, that a challenge on the constitutional validity of the mandatory death penalty in such cases should be properly filed, presented, and fully argued before the High Court and escalated to the Court of Appeal, if necessary, at which a similar outcome as that in this case may be reached. Muruatetu as it now stands cannot directly be applicable to those cases.”






28.
It, then, follows that the issue regarding the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence under Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code is yet to be addressed as recommended by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the death sentence under section 296(2) of the Penal Code is not, at this jurisprudential moment, and by dint of the Supreme Court’s directions, unconstitutional, and remains a valid and legal penalty. In this case, the ingredients of robbery with violence have been met. The appellant robbed the complainant, and in the course of the robbery was armed with a dangerous weapon which he used to injure the complainant with and there is evidence to that effect. The Penal Code prescribes the death sentence for the offence of robbery with violence and that sentence is still legal.
The upshot is that this appeal lacks merit and is dismissed. We uphold the judgment of the High Court and affirm the death sentence.

Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the judgement of the High Court of Kenya at Kakamega (R.N. Sitati, J.) dated 13th October, 2019 in HCCRA No. 109 of 2014)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant, Rodgers Kifunyi, was the accused person in the trial before the Senior Principal Magistrate’s Court at Vihiga in Criminal Case No. 790 of 2013. He was charged with four (4) counts. Two of the counts were of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code; one was for gang rape contrary to section 10; and the final one was for personating a public official contrary to section 105 of the Penal Code. All the alleged offences were committed on the night of 16
th
 August, 2013 at Chavakali township in Chavakali location within Vihiga County.






2.
The appellant pleaded not guilty to all the charged counts and the case proceeded to full hearing. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial magistrate found the appellant guilty of all four counts and convicted him accordingly. He was sentenced to death on    count I (of robbery with violence) as provided by the law, whilst the sentences on the remaining counts were held in abeyance.






3.
The appellant was aggrieved by the decision of the lower court and filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence before the High Court at Kakamega via Criminal Appeal No. 109 of 2014.






4.
The High Court (R.N. Sitati, J.) dismissed the appeal and upheld the convictions and sentences in a judgment dated 13
th
 October, 2017.






5.
The appellant was again dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court and has lodged the present appeal. He raised three (3) grounds in his Amended Memorandum of Appeal. They are that:
1.
The learned judge and magistrate erred in law by failing to consider the mitigation by the appellant herein as well as the respondent before sentencing.
2.
The learned magistrate erred in law by depriving the appellant his constitutional right to legal representation considering the nature of the charges he faced.
3.
The learned judge erred in law by failing to make a finding that the appellant did not have a fair trial.






6.
Given the nature of these grounds, it is unnecessary for us to rehash the facts of the case as they emerged in the two courts below in any detailed fashion. However, we shall give a summary of how the proceedings were conducted at the trial court for purposes of contextualizing the grounds of appeal before us – all of which hinge on procedural due process.






7.
The record shows that the appellant was arraigned in court on 19
th
 August, 2013, and took a plea on the same day. He was represented by learned counsel, Mr. Lugadiru, who requested to be supplied with a copy of the charge sheet and witness statements. The court also ordered a release of the appellant on a bond of Kshs. 200,000.00 with surety of a similar amount. However, the appellant remained in custody during the pendency of the trial, presumably because he was unable to meet the bond terms.






8.
Thereafter, the hearing of the case was scheduled on 25
th
 September, 2013, but on that day, the prosecution prayed for an adjournment as none of the witnesses were present in court, even though copies of bonds in the file showed that they were bonded. The court granted the prosecution the last adjournment; and hearing was again scheduled on 23
rd
 October, 2013. On that day, the prosecution told the court that one witness was present in court and the rest were on their way. However, the appellant had not been brought to court prompting the prosecutor to apply for a production order. The court pointed out that it would be going for a prison visit later that day, and that, therefore, the matter would be mentioned there.






9.
The next hearing was scheduled on 20
th
 November, 2013, but no witnesses appeared in court on that day despite being called. The prosecution prayed for another adjournment which was objected to by the appellant, on the ground that he was suffering in custody. The appellant’s counsel, Mr. Lugadiru, was not present in court when he objected to the prayer for adjournment. However, the    court granted the prosecution “the very last adjournment” and scheduled the next hearing on 15
th
 January, 2014. Later that afternoon, the appellant’s counsel sought audience of the court and stated that the date issued for the next hearing was not convenient and prayed that the date be changed to 22
nd
 January, 2014. The court obliged. In addition, copies of statements were issued to the appellant’s counsel together with the copy of the identification parade form.






10.
On 22
nd
 January, 2014, the prosecution yet again prayed for an adjournment on the ground that none of the witnesses were present in court. The appellant’s counsel objected to the said application for adjournment. He argued that the prosecution lacked seriousness since it had failed to follow up on its witnesses. He also argued that the appellant had been in custody all along and was entitled to a fair hearing without undue delay. Thus, his rights had been violated.






11.
In this regard, the court noted that the prosecution had been granted the very last adjournment on 20
th
 November, 2013, and witnesses summons were also issued. However, the then court clerk, Mr. Ojwang, did not write the said witnesses summons nor take them to the learned magistrate for signing. For this reason, the court made an order that Mr. Ojwang should write an explanatory letter and give reasons why he did not adhere to the court order. Consequently, the court granted the prosecution the last adjournment and scheduled the next hearing date on 19
th
 February, 2014.






12.
On 19
th
 February, 2014, the trial learned magistrate was indisposed and the next hearing was set on 11
th
 March, 2014. On that day, however, the prosecution told the court that the file had been called for by the Senior DPP Kakamega for perusal, and had, therefore, been forwarded to him. In the premise, the prosecution prayed for a mention within two (2) weeks for directions on whether or not the case would proceed. The appellant had no objection and mention was set on 24
th
 March, 2014, for further directions. On the said mention date, the prosecution prayed for another mention date in a week’s time. The appellant had no objection and the court allowed the application for mention. On 31
st
 March, 2013, the prosecutor told the court that the matter was “supposed to be withdrawn” but he did not have the police file with him. Therefore, he was unable to comment as he had been informed by one PC Mathenge, that the file had been taken to Kakamega. In the circumstances, he requested for summons to issue to the In- Charge crime office. The appellant’s counsel was absent on that day and so the appellant, on his part, prayed for summons to witnesses and argued that he had suffered in remand for long and the case had never proceeded. The court concurred with the appellant but ordered that he be detained at Vihiga Police Station. It also directed that CCIO, Mr. Kenga, deals with the matter since summons and warrants of arrest against the witnesses could not issue as their whereabouts were unknown. For this reason, mention was set on 1
st
 April, 2014.






13.
On 1
st
 April, 2014, the prosecutor informed the court that the file had been found at the station; and that it had not been taken to the State counsel as had earlier been indicated. As such, there was no advice from the State counsel. In the circumstances, he urged the court to issue summons to the Officer In-Charge Chavakali Police Station to explain the position of the case as he had no instructions and he did not understand why the Police had given the court a false indication that the matter was coming up for withdrawal. The appellant had no objection to the said application. However, even in allowing the application by the prosecution, the court observed that the appellant’s constitutional right to have a speedy and fair trial had been infringed. It, therefore, issued a warrant of arrest against the prosecution witnesses and the In- Charge Chavakali Patrol Base; and set the hearing for 11
th
 April, 2014.






14.
On the set hearing date, Sgt. Farah Mohammed, the In-Charge Chavakali Patrol Base, appeared before the court and stated that the complainant was a Nairobi resident who worked as a maid. She explained that she had been bonded several times and came to court but the case never kicked off. Later on, she was informed by the investigation officer that the complainant used to switch off her phone and was nowhere to be found. The complainant had, reportedly, also said that she had no money to travel for court sessions. Sgt Mohammed said that she had instructed the investigation officer to write a forwarding letter and inform the OCPD and DPP of the plight of the complainant, so that they could    get instructions on how the matter would proceed. Unfortunately, she got some family issues which she had to attend to. She, therefore, went on leave assured that the investigation officer had written a forwarding letter as she had instructed. Upon receiving summons by the court to appear before it, she found out that the investigation officer was on leave and had not written the forwarding letter as she had instructed. In the circumstances, she requested the court to grant her a short time to take the file to the State counsel; and pointed out that even though the complainant and her husband were nowhere to be found, the other witnesses, who were police officers, were available.






15.
The appellant, whose counsel was not present in court that day, objected to the said application on the ground that he had appeared in court several times and the prosecution always said the same thing. He argued that he was suffering in custody and the witnesses who were free citizens did not bother to attend court. In reply Sgt. Farah Mohammed stated that there were times when the witnesses attended court but the case never proceeded; and given that the complainant had a three-month old baby during the incident, she got tired of attending court. While the court appeared dissatisfied with the Police response, noting that the sergeant had only appeared in response to a warrant of arrest, the court acquiesced to the request to grant the prosecution and investigators one more chance to prosecute the matter. The “very final” mention was scheduled for 25
th
 April, 2014.






16.
On 25
th
 April, 2024, Sgt. Farah Mohammed told the court that she had taken steps to write to the OCS, who, in turn, wrote to the OCPD; and the OCPD wrote to the DCIO and DPP. In the circumstances, she requested for two (2) weeks to personally follow up the matter and stated that if she got feedback from the DPP before completion of the two (2) weeks, she would request for the appellant’s production order. Both the prosecutor and the appellant had no objection to the application made and so the last mention was scheduled for 9
th
 May, 2014. Meanwhile, the appellant’s counsel requested to be discharged from the record. The court granted his request and also noted that the last time he appeared before the court was in January, 2014.






17.
On 9
th
 May, 2014, Sgt. Farah Mohammed informed the court that she had a letter from the DPP. The prosecutor confirmed receipt of the letters dated 5
th
, 6
th
 and 7
th
 May, 2014, and an affidavit by the investigation officer. The letter from the DPP was to the effect that it declined to withdraw the matter as the office had taken the initiative to contact the complainant who had signaled her willingness to testify. In response, the appellant told the court that he was ready to proceed but needed time to read the statements and be prepared. On the same day, the court directed the complainant and the investigation officer (who were present in court) to explain their whereabouts since their failure to attend court for the ten (10) months had led to the infringement of the appellant’s right to have a speedy trial.






18.
On her part, the complainant told the court that she once attended court, although she could not remember the exact date, but the case did not proceed. The next time she was to attend court, one PC Kemboi called and informed her that the case had been adjourned to another date. Therefore, she travelled back to Nairobi since her employer had given a few days leave and she had to return as she feared losing her job. Since then, she had been in Nairobi but had no money to travel. She reported that she was only able to attend court on that material day because she had come home for a burial.






19.
The investigation officer, PC Daniel Kemboi, told the court that he took the file to Mudete Police Station to enable the OCS to write a letter and forward it to the OCPD to report that the complainant could not be traced. However, the State counsel called the complainant the day before the said material date of the hearing and she indicated that she would attend court as she was attending a burial. She, however, said that she did not have money for transport, and as such, the investigation officer paid for her transport and she attended court.






20.
Upon the explanation advanced by the complainant and investigation officer, by consent of the appellant, the hearing was scheduled on 14
th
 May, 2014. However, on that day, the appellant complained that he was sick and needed treatment; and so hearing was scheduled on 16
th
 May, 2014.






21.
On the date of the hearing, the prosecution informed the court that it was ready to proceed with all six (6) prosecution witnesses    present. The hearing of the case commenced with three (3) prosecution witnesses namely: the complainant; the clinical officer, Sammy Chelule, who examined the complainant; and the complainant’s husband, G.L. They testified as PW1, PW2 and PW3 respectively. The appellant cross examined all of them. Thereafter, the appellant informed the court that he was not ready to proceed with the other three remaining witnesses as he wished to have PW1 and PW3 recalled on the ground that he was not satisfied with their answers. The prosecution had no objection to the application and further hearing was set on 23
rd
 June, 2014.






22.
On 23
rd
 June, 2014, the appellant reiterated to the court that he was not ready to proceed with the three (3) remaining witnesses as he wished to recall PW1 and PW2 on the ground that he was not satisfied with their answers. The prosecution objected to the application and argued that the case had taken a long time to commence since the investigation officer had a difficult time tracing the complainant and her husband. He further stated that the court had the privilege of seeing them in person whereby the complainant explained their financial difficulty, which the appellant was well aware of and he had also been given time to prepare for the case by being supplied with witness statements. In short, the prosecutor argued that there was no basis for recalling the witnesses; and that granting the order would unreasonably lengthen the trial period.






23.
The court briefly traced the history of the case – noting the lengthy delays caused by both the prosecution and the appellant – and pointed out that the appellant had not only been given sufficient   time to prepare for the trial; but had also been given ample time to cross-examine the witnesses. The court also noted that although section 150 of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for prosecution witnesses to be recalled, the same was only permissible if that person’s evidence is essential to the just decision of the court. Further, the section was conditional to the court’s discretion based on whether either party would be prejudiced if the prosecution witnesses were not recalled. Be that as it may, the court ruled that even if it was to allow the recalling of witnesses, it did not mean that other witnesses could not testify until the previous witnesses were recalled. Consequently, the court ordered the case to proceed the following day with the witnesses present before the court, and if not, it would invoke section 99 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






24.
On 24
th
 June, 2014, the matter proceeded with Cpl Reuben Makacha, the arresting officer; and Sgt. Farah Mohamed, testifying as PW4 and PW5 respectively. Thereafter, the appellant requested to be supplied with identification parade forms which were subsequently supplied to him in open court. Further hearing was scheduled for the following day - 25
th
 June, 2014 - whereby Chief Inspector Peter Kiema, the officer who conducted the identification parade, and PC Daniel Kemboi, the investigating officer, testified as PW6 and PW7 respectively. All these witnesses were cross examined by the appellant.






25.
Afterwards, the prosecution informed the court that it had called all its witnesses. The appellant on his side told the court that if the complainant and her husband could not be found to be recalled,    then the matter could proceed. However, he prayed for the OB from Mbale Police Station dated 17
th
 June, 2013 to be availed in court as he wanted to compare the names of the people in the identification parade alongside the names of the people in the OB. The prosecution did not object to the said application and the court ordered the said OB to be availed to the appellant the following day during the further hearing.






26.
On 26
th
 June, 2014, the appellant informed the court that he wished to have the file closed. Meanwhile, the prosecution supplied the appellant with the OB for 17
th
 June, 2013, in open court as had been ordered; and closed its case.






27.
In a ruling dated 11
th
 July, 2014, the court found that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against the appellant and put him on his defence. On the same day, the appellant gave sworn testimony and called no witnesses. He informed the court that he wished to file written submissions, an application which was allowed.






28.
As afore-stated, the learned trial magistrate found the appellant guilty of all four counts and convicted him accordingly. During mitigation, the appellant informed the court that he had a family, who included his father who had two wives, and they solely depended on him. He also said that he was a sickly person. The prosecution informed the court that the appellant was a first offender.






29.
Being dissatisfied with the decision of the trial court, the appellant appealed to the High Court initially through M/S Kiveu & Co.    Advocates, who, through K.N. Wesutsa & Co. Advocates, filed a Supplementary Record of Appeal. The petition of appeal consisted of the following nine (9) grounds reproduced verbatim:
1.
That the learned magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant in total disregard of the law.
2.
That the learned trial magistrate grossly erred in relying on contradictory, non-corroborative and unreliable evidence tendered by the prosecution in convicting the appellant.
3.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting the appellant on a defective charge sheet.
4.
That the appellant’s constitutional right to a proper defence collorary of which is timely provision of prosecution witness statements and documents for use in court was not upheld thereby occasioning an injustice.
5.
That the trial magistrate erred in fact and law by completely disregarding the appellants case and evidence thereby occasioning an injustice.
6.
That the trial magistrate erred in her judgment as she thereby inexplicably arrived at a conclusion that by merely being arrested as a suspect the appellant was guilty as charged.
7.
That the trial magistrate’s evaluation and treatment of the appellant’s evidence was perfunctory.
8.
That the trial Magistrates erred by holding that the prosecution had established its case against the    appellant beyond reasonable doubt notwithstanding the omission on its part to summon and corroborate evidence linking the appellant to the offence charged.
9.
That the trial magistrate erred both in law and fact by imposing a sentence that was not only manifesting high but illegal.






30.
It is unnecessary for us to go into the details of the grounds raised at the High Court except to point out that the appellant did not raise the argument about the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty.






31.
The appeal before us was argued by way of written submissions by both parties. During the virtual hearing, learned counsel Mr. Bagada appeared for the appellant, whereas learned counsel, Ms. Busienei appeared for the respondent. Both parties relied on their submissions and gave brief oral highlights.






32.
On the first ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant contended that the trial court fell into error for not considering the appellant’s mitigation including the fact that he was a first offender. He argued that the record showed that the trial learned magistrate failed to consider the said mitigation due to the mandatory sentence prescribed in section 296(2) of the Penal Code. Thus, the court did not exercise its discretion in sentencing the appellant. He sought to rely on this Court’s decision in Cyrus Kavai Onzere vs. Republic, [2023] eKLR.






33.
Counsel argued the other two grounds of appeal together – ultimately arguing that the trial court violated the appellant’s constitutional rights by not supplying him with an advocate considering the very serious charges the appellant was facing. At no particular time during the trial, counsel argued, was the appellant made aware of his right to have legal representation at the expense of the State. In this regard, he relied on this Court’s decision in David Njoroge Macharia vs. Republic, Nairobi Criminal Appeal No. 497 of 2007 [2011] eKLR, wherein it was held that Article 50(1) of 
the Constitution
, 2010, provides that an accused person shall have an advocate assigned to him by the State and at state expense, if substantial injustice would otherwise result. And that even though substantial injustice is not defined under 
the Constitution
, the provisions of international conventions that Kenya is signatory to are applicable by virtue of Article 2(6). Therefore, provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the commentaries by the Human Rights Committee may provide instances where legal aid is mandatory.






34.
Opposing the appeal, Ms. Busienei reminded this Court of its role as the second appellate court, which is to deal with matters of law only and not delve into matters of fact which have been dealt with by the trial court and re-evaluated by the first appellate court. Counsel relied on this Court’s decision in Karani vs. Republic [2010] 1 KLR 73.






35.
Counsel submitted that she did not respond to the appellant’s first and second ground because he never raised them at the High Court. In any event, she submitted that the record showed that the appellant was represented by counsel at the trial court and was supplied with all documentation necessary for his defence. Ms. Busienei further argued that the record showed that the appellant did not proceed with his advocate during trial but no reasons were indicated for his discharge.






36.
On the third ground, the totality of counsel’s written submissions was to the effect that the appellant was afforded a fair trial and convicted accordingly. Ms. Busienei argued that the entire record showed that the appellant was accorded a fair trial; and that the trial court went out of its way to ensure that the appellant’s rights were respected. She further argued that the circumstances of the offence were so chilling and called for the death sentence to be maintained. The appellant and his accomplices, she argued, not only violently robbed the victims, but even though the victims cooperated and begged for mercy, they gang-raped the complainant who had only recently given birth – and even sadistically threatened to penetrate her using a panga.






37.
This is a second appeal. As such, our jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of matters of law only, by dint of section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is only on rare occasions that we interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below. In Samuel Warui Karimi vs. Republic [2016] eKLR, it was held as follows:
“This is a second appeal and this Court has stated many times before, it will not normally interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below unless such findings are based on no evidence, or are based on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the courts below are shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in making the findings. See Chemangong -vs- R, [1984] KLR 611.”






38.
We have carefully considered the appeal, the rival submissions of the parties and the authorities cited in support of the opposing positions.






39.
The first ground of appeal is that the trial court erred by not considering the appellant’s mitigation since it sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty stipulated in section 296(2) of the Penal Code. Unfortunately for the appellant, this argument, which relies on the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic [2017] eKLR (Muruatetu 1), cannot succeed for two reasons. First, the Supreme Court has given categorical guidance in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic; Katiba Institute & 5 others (Amicus Curiae) (2021) eKLR (Muruatetu 2) that the holding in Muruatetu 1 is inapplicable to the offence of robbery with violence. Second, as the Supreme Court reiterated recently in Republic v Joshua Gichuki Mwangi; (Petiti
on E018 of 2023
) [2024] KESC 34 (KLR), this Court is deprived of jurisdiction to consider a matter which was not first raised at the High Court. To this extent, the appellant misunderstands this Court’s holding in Cyrus Kavai Onzere vs Republic [2023] eKLR. In that case, this Court held
that while this Court may consider the constitutionality of mandatory death sentence in section 296(2) of the Penal Code drawing from the analogous reasoning in Muruatetu 1, it can only do so where the constitutional question has been preserved for determination by this Court by first raising it in the High Court. The constitutional argument cannot be raised for the first time on second appeal.






40.
The next due process argument the appellant raises is with respect to the right to representation. He heavily relied on this Court’s decision in David Njoroge Macharia vs. Republic (supra). In fact, the decision does not state that all persons charged with capital offences in Kenya are automatically entitled to legal representation provided by the State as the appellant urges. The relevant holding of the Court is that:
“
The current Constitution provides:


50.
(1)
Every person has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair and public hearing before a court or, if appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or body.
(2)
Every accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right—
…
(c)
to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence;
…
g.
to choose, and be represented by, an advocate, and to be informed of this right promptly;
h.
to have an advocate assigned to the accused person by the State and at State expense, if substantial injustice would otherwise result, and to be informed of this right promptly;”




Article 50 sets out a right to a fair hearing, which includes the right of an accused person to have an advocate if it is in the interests of ensuring justice.….
Under the new Constitution, state funded legal representation is a right in certain instances. Article 50  (1) provides that an accused shall have an advocate assigned to him by the State and at state expense, if substantial injustice would otherwise result (emphasis added). Substantial injustice is not defined under 
the Constitution
, however, provisions of international conventions that Kenya is signatory to are applicable by virtue of Article 2 (6). Therefore, provisions of the ICCPR and the commentaries by the Human Rights Committee may provide instances where legal aid is mandatory.
We are of the considered view that in addition to situations where “substantial injustice would otherwise result”, persons accused of capital offences where the penalty is loss of life have the right to legal representation at state expense. We would not go so far as to suggest that every accused person convicted of a capital offence since the coming into effect of the new Constitution would automatically be entitled to a re- trial where no such legal representation was provided. The reasons are that, firstly, the provisions of the new Constitution will not apply retroactively, and secondly every case must be decided on its own merit to    determine if there was serious prejudice occasioned by reason of such omission.”






41.
The position presently obtaining in Kenya is that an accused person is only entitled to legal representation provided by the State where he can demonstrate, in the unique circumstances of his case, that he cannot afford an advocate, and that he would suffer substantial injustice if he is not represented by counsel in his case. The potential penalty upon conviction is but one of the factors that the court considers in determining if substantial injustice would be occasioned if a State-appointed counsel is not provided at trial. The other factors include the accused person’s own circumstances such as his ability to understand the nature of the case he is facing.






42.
In the present case, we note that the appellant had secured his own private counsel when the trial began. The advocate later asked to be discharged from the case, and the appellant did not object to the application. It is not apparent why the advocate asked to be discharged. However, after discharge, the appellant asked for time to prepare for the case, and requested to be supplied afresh with witness statements and other documents to enable him to prepare for the trial. Both requests were granted by the trial court. Later on, the case proceeded to completion. The record indicates that the appellant cross-examined the prosecution witnesses vigorously    – and even applied to recall some witnesses.






43.
In the circumstances of this case, we are unable to come to the conclusion, as desired by the appellant, that he suffered substantial injustice when he was not provided with an advocate    funded by the State. All indications are that the appellant was able to represent himself effectively; and that he suffered no substantial injustice from the fact that he was not represented by counsel.






44.
Finally, we will address the general complaint that the whole trial suffered such serious procedural infirmities that it should yield the conclusion that the appellant did not receive fair trial and is, therefore, entitled to an order for re-trial. We took time to rehash the entire procedural history of the case in the first part of this judgment because we believe that the record speaks for itself that there were no such serious violations of procedural due process as would lead this Court to the conclusion that there was a mistrial. It is true that there was an unusual delay in starting the trial – and that the delay was characterized by a bizarre charade by the investigating team; a charade that involved seemingly untrue indications to the trial court that the DPP was mulling withdrawal of the charges. However, it is also true that the trial court actively took control of the docket and did everything in its power to ensure that the trial was completed in the shortest time possible. The efforts by the trial court to ensure justice was served included the unusual but necessary step to issue a warrant of arrest to the officer in charge of the police station whence the criminal charge originated; and requiring the investigating officer to explain why she had variously failed to summon witnesses to court.






45.
Taking into consideration all the factors – including the various times that the appellant or his advocate requested for adjournments hence contributing to the delay in concluding the    trial – it cannot be said that the appellant was subjected to a trial process that can be termed offensive to the concept of fundamental fairness. At the end of the day, the appellant’s trial proceeded to full hearing; the appellant was accorded adequate facilities to prepare and conduct his defence; and was granted ample opportunity to confront and cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. In short, the trial process met the minimum threshold for procedural due process demanded by our Constitution.






46.
The upshot is that the appeal herein is unmeritorious. It is hereby dismissed in its entirety.






47.
Orders accordingly.

HM Okwengu, HA Omondi & JM Ngugi, JJA





          August 30, 2024
        






Between




Sustainet Group Limited


 


Applicant




and




John Wanguhu


 


Respondent







        
          (Application for stay of proceedings pending the hearing and determination of the Ruling and Order of the Employment & Labour Relations Court at Kisumu (Baari, J.) dated 21st July, 2022 in ELRC Case No. E085 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
On 5
th
 February 2024, the Court allowed the applicant’s motion dated 2nd November 2023 seeking stay of proceedings in Kisumu ELRC No. E085 of 2021, pending the hearing of an intended appeal by the applicant, Sustainet Group Limited, from the ruling of the Employment and Labour Relations Court (C.N. Baari, J) dated 21
st
 July, 2022. We now give our reasons for allowing that motion.






2.
In the ruling subject of the intended appeal, the learned Judge of the ELRC had dismissed an application dated 17
th
 December, 2021 by the applicant, in which the applicant sought orders for stay of the proceedings pending arbitration, and an order that the dispute between the parties be referred to arbitration. The applicant contended that it had entered into a contract with the respondent, John Wanguhu, for him to be employed as Capacity Building Officer at a starting salary of Kshs. 350,000/= per month, with effect from 31
st
 November, 2021, and that clause 11 of the employment contract provided for arbitration in case of a dispute. However, when a dispute arose, the respondent instituted Kisumu ELRC No. E085 of 2021 prematurely, and in violation of clause 11 of the agreement.






3.
In response to the application, the respondent explained that upon being dismissed from employment, he sought the assistance of the Kisumu Labour Office, whereby a letter was written to the applicant inviting it for negotiations, but the applicant ignored the invitation, and this caused him to file Kisumu ELRC No. E085 of 2021.






4.
In dismissing the application, the learned judge of the ELRC noted how the applicant handled the calls to settle the respondent’s claim out of court, and concluded that the arbitration agreement embodied in the contract was incapable of being performed because of the applicants’ attitude. The judge further stated that pursuant to Section 12 of the Employment and 
Labour Relations Act
, the ELRC had original jurisdiction to hear the dispute, and that jurisdiction, could not be ousted by dint of clause 11 of the contract of employment entered into between the applicant and the respondent.






5.
It is that ruling that led the applicant to prefer to this Court, the appeal, together with the notice of motion under Rules 5(2)(b) and 49 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2022, seeking stay of proceedings in Kisumu ELRC No. E085 of 2021, pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal. The application was supported by and affidavit sworn by Thomas Owidi Apina, a director of the applicant, and grounds stated on the face of the motion. In a nutshell, the director deposed that the dispute between the applicant and the respondent was premised on an employment agreement, which provided for arbitration, and, therefore, the dispute ought to have been referred to arbitration. The applicant contended that the intended appeal raises arguable issues and that unless the orders sought were granted, the respondent would proceed to have Kisumu ELRC No. E085 of 2021 heard on 21
st
 November 2023 as scheduled, and the applicant’s appeal which advocates for arbitration, would be of no use.






6.
The applicant filed written submissions in which it cited Butt -vs- Rent Restrictions Tribunal [1982] eKLR 417 urging that the Court has the discretion to grant the orders sought. It also relied on Trust Bank Limited & Another -vs- Investech Bank Limited 3 Others [2000] eKLR; and Stanley Kangethe Kinyanjui -vs- Tony Ketter & 5 Others [2013] eKLR, urging that its appeal raises arguable issues, which includes, the ELRC’s misapprehension of facts and misguided interpretation of Section 6(1) of the 
Arbitration Act
, and the ELRC’s failure to enforce the mutually agreed and express terms of the employment agreement.






7.
The applicant’s notice of motion was opposed through a replying affidavit sworn by the respondent, in which the respondent maintained that the motion had been filed with inordinate delay, as the impugned ruling was delivered on 21
st
 July, 2022, while the motion was filed on 16
th
 November, 2023. The respondent deposed that the applicant was not deserving of the orders sought as he was a person with no regard to the law or orders of any court, and was, therefore, not deserving of the exercise of the Court’s discretion.






8.
During the plenary hearing of the motion, Mr. Nderitu appeared for the applicant while Mr. Tawo appeared for the respondent. Mr. Nderitu argued that the ruling of the ELRC is contrary to established legal principles and the provisions of the 
Arbitration Act
, and that unless the Court granted an order for stay of proceedings, the applicant would be prejudiced as its appeal would be a mere academic exercise. In response, Mr. Tawo argued that the applicant’s motion was only intended to delay the respondent’s suit. He admitted that the applicant’s intended appeal is arguable, but maintained that the appeal would not be rendered nugatory if the hearing in the ELRC proceeds, as on appeal, the Court can easily set aside the judgment of the ELRC.






9.
Upon considering the application, the written and oral submissions and the memorandum of appeal, we were satisfied that the applicant’s intended appeal is arguable as it raises issues that are capable of ventilation on appeal. In particular, the issue regarding the ELRC’s jurisdiction to entertain the dispute, in light of the arbitration clause in the employment contract between the applicant and the respondent is a pertinent issue.






10.
As regards the nugatory aspect, it was evident that absent an order of stay of proceedings, the ELRC would proceed to hear the respondent’s suit and may issue orders that would unnecessarily complicate the appeal. Although this Court on appeal could set aside any judgment of the ELRC in this regard, it was important, in our view, and in the interest of expediency, to grant the order of stay of proceedings, as this would save judicial time and also save the parties unnecessary expense. We note that the ruling subject of the intended appeal was delivered on 21
st
 July, 2022, and the motion before us was filed on more than a year later. In the circumstances of this case, we did not consider such delay inordinate.






11.
Accordingly, we issued the order for stay of proceedings pending the hearing of the appeal. We further order that the costs of the motion shall abide the outcome of the appeal.

Ruling










1.
Before court is the Summons dated 18
th
 May, 2023 and brought under Sections 49 of the Probate and Administration Rules. The Applicant sought for orders:-
a.
The Honourable court be pleased to order that the Lands Registrar Kiambu Lands Registry does cancel any and all subdivisions resultant from the subdivision of Land Title Number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 and specifically cancel the subdivision giving rise to and the resultant registers to;
1.
Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/822
2.
Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/823
3.
Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/824
4.
Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/825
And does reopen and reinstate the closed register to Land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 and does proceed to forthwith issue a Title Deed over the reinstated Land Title number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 in the names of the administrator of the estate of the deceased Jonah Thumbi.
b.
In execution of order (a) above, the Lands Registrar Kiambu Lands Registry be ordered to dispense with the production and surrender of Original title deeds to
2.1 Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/822
2.2 Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/823
2.3 Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/824
2.4 Land Title Komothai/Kiambururu/825
Held by some of the beneficiaries to this estate and proceed with the implementation of the court order without requiring the production and surrender of the said original title deeds.
c.
The Honourable court be pleased to order the Lands Registrar Kiambu to reaccept the transfer to the Personal representatives as the executor/Administrator had prepared Form LRA 30 in respect to Land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 and land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161/18 and register the same in the register to Land Title Number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 and Komothai/Kiambururu T161/18.
d.
The Honourable court be pleased to order that the county government of Kiambu and the Kiambu Lands registrar does cancel, vacate and annul any subdivisions to land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161/18 and does reinstate the deceased proprietor’s name in the register to the said property and does issue the lease and certificate of lease thereof in the names of the Administrators of the estate of the deceased herein.
e.
The Honourable court be pleased to order that the County Lands Surveyor Kiambu County be ordered to subdivide Land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 into six equal portions or such other number of portions in conformity with the certificate of confirmation of grant dated 5
th
 March, 2020 issued in this matter.
f.
The Honourable court does issue an order directing the Officer Commanding Githunguri/Kigumo Police Stations to provide security to the Surveyor undertaking the survey of Title Number Komothai/Kiambururu/89 and ensure that peace is maintained during the exercise.






2.
Karen Wanjjiku Thumbi in her supporting affidavit deposed that she is a beneficiary of the deceased’s estate. On 27/07/2018, the court revoked the grant and proceeded to order that property being Ruiru Town/70 be sold and the proceeds to be distributed amongst the beneficiaries, that Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161/18 be distributed six ways amongst the beneficiaries of the estate and that the property being Komothai/Kiambururu/89 be subdivided six ways amongst the beneficiaries of the estate thereafter the court confirmed the grant and issued a certificate of confirmation of grant as provided in the ruling dated 5
th
 March, 2020. She also deposed that a consent was recorded that Komothai/Kambururu/T 161/18 is too small to be subdivided as such it should be valued and whoever wishes to keep their share to buy off the share of the other beneficiaries and/or the same to be sold and the proceeds shared six ways amongst the beneficiaries. This caused the certificate of the confirmation of grant to be amended to the effect that the said property was to be sold. From all the orders of the court, only Ruiru Town/70 has been sold and the proceeds distributed. In regard to Komothai/Kiambururu/89 the Registrar failed to effect transfer as the register had been closed for subdivision numbers 822-825 registered in the names of the 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Respondents respectively. For Kiambururu T 161/18 the Registrar stated that the lease had expired. She stated that the Registrar requires a court order to cancel the subdivision and that the county government needs to extend the lease. She contended that vide the ruling dated 27/7/2018, Komothai/Kiambururu/89 was amalgamated as one to be shared equally in six ways as such they are unable to implement the said order. Further, she averred that the county government of Kiambu has extended the lease for plot T 161/18 and only an order of the court is pending for its implementation. The beneficiaries insist they want a government surveyor for subdivision of Komothai/Kiambururu/89. In the circumstances, the courts intervention is needed to finalize the matter herein.






3.
Esther Njeri Kagunda the 3
rd
 Respondent swore her replying affidavit dated 7
th
 June, 2023 on her own behalf and on behalf of the 4
th
, 5
th
 and 6
th
 Respondents. She averred that they have complied with the orders of the court dated 5
th
 March, 2020 and the consent of 31/03/2020. George Mbuthia Thumbi was not paying rates for Komothai/Kiambururu/T161/18B as such the lease expired causing the registration to be rejected. Karan Wanjiku should be provided by Peter Muigai and George Mbuthia as such Komothai/Kiambururu/822 and 823 should be subdivided further. She presented a proposal that they were agreeable to in regard to plot no. 18B and Komothai /Kiambururu/822 and 823. Amalgamation of Komothai/Kiambururu 824 and 825 will compound a dispute that has already been resolved as there are permanent structures thereon. Lastly Peter Muigai and George Mbuthia should provide for Karen Wanjiku so as to resolve this matter.






4.
Eunice Wanjiru Mwaria in her replying affidavit sworn on 7
th
 July, 2023. She averred that Esther Njeri reached out to Mary Wairimu, Eunice Wanjiru and Gladys Nyamahu and purchased their shares of Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161. With regard to Komothai/Kiambururu/89 the same was divided into four equal portions in the names of George Mbuthia, Peter Muigai, Esther Njeri and Mary Wairimu leaving out other beneficiaries. Karen Wanjiku’s share can only be derived from Komothai/Kiambururu/822 and 823. She joined issues with the proposal as provided in the affidavit dated 7/6/2023.






5.
The Applicant and the Respondents failed to file written submissions but wished to rely on the Summons and their replying affidavits respectively.






Issues for Determination


6.
After reading the application and the parties affidavits this court has framed the following issues for determination;
i.
Whether this court has jurisdiction to make orders for cancellation of titles.
(ii)
Whether to grant police security to the County Land Surveyor Kiambu to execute his duties








Analysis


Whether this court has jurisdiction to make orders for cancellation of titles.


7.
The applicable law is found at Sections 47 and 73 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 which gives the Probate court inherent powers necessary to meet the ends of justice and to prevent abuse of the court process; There are already orders in place revoking the Grant and for the title Deeds to revert back to the names of the deceased person; which in essence amounts to cancellation of the title deeds and the only issue pending is implementation.








8.
Starting with Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161/18 the Applicant seeks an order that the county government of Kiambu and the Kiambu Lands Registrar do cancel, vacate and annul any subdivisions to land title number Komothai/Kiambururu/T.161/18 and reinstates the deceased proprietor’s name in the register to the said property and then issues the lease and certificate of lease thereof in the names of the Administrators of the estate of the deceased herein.






9.
From the affidavits it is noted that the county government has extended the expired lease but has put conditions in place which are found to be very reasonable in that it only requires the full payment of outstanding rates touching on Komothai/ Kiambururu/T.161/18B before it fully complies; The Administrator is therefore hereby directed to pay any outstanding rates due to the County Government from the estate of the deceased for and on behalf of the defaulting beneficiary. Thereafter upon the sale of Komothai/ Kiambururu/T.161/18 such amounts can be deducted from the proceeds of the defaulting beneficiary’s share; the said defaulting beneficiary being George Mbuthia Thumbi;






Whether to grant police security to the County Lands Surveyor to execute his duties


10.
With regard to Komothai/Kiambururu/89 the Applicant seeks for the above order but has not demonstrated to the court that such a request was ever made to the relevant police station and the request was then denied; Further the prayer sought is unsupported by any affidavit or report by the Surveyor on the visits or attempts made to the land for the purpose of carrying out the assignment and that he was unable to carry out the assignment due to threats made; and if any threats were occasioned then were these incident(s) ever reported to the Githunguri/Kigumo Police Stations;  the OB extract if any ought to have been annexed to the affidavit or report.








11.
In the absence of any material placed before this court to support the request this court is not satisfied that there any bona fide reasons to grant the surveyor police security for purposes of carrying out the assignment.








Findings and Determination


12.
For the forgoing reasons this court makes the following findings and determinations
i.
This court finds that it has jurisdiction to hear this application.
ii.
The application for police security for the surveyor is not merited.
iii.
This court shall make final orders upon compliance
(iv.
Mention on 27/11/2024 for compliance.

In the matter of




Abdullahi Kambi Guracha


 


Administrator










Ruling










1.
Before the Court is Summons dated 29 February 2024 seeking the following orders:
i.
That the Honourable Court be pleased to review, vary and/or set aside the orders made by Hon. Mr. Justice Magare Dennis Kizito Ngwono on the 16th day of January 2023 dismissing/striking out/closing and/or terminating the succession cause herein and all other consequential orders thereto.
ii.
That the Honourable Court be pleased to reinstate the succession cause herein
iii.
That the Honourable Court be pleased to slate down for hearing the Summons for Confirmation of Grant dated the 29th day of December 2023 filed in the cause herein
iv.
That the costs of the application be in the cause.






2.
The Application is supported by the Affidavit of Mary Wambui Mwangi, the Administrator and the grounds on the face of the Application.






3.
In the Affidavit, the Administrator/Applicant, widow to the Deceased, states that the Letters of Administration Intestate were made to her on 29 September 2021. Upon the lapse of the 6 months, the Administrator/Applicant tried to convene a meeting between herself and the beneficiaries. It was, however, difficult to do so since two beneficiaries reside abroad. The meeting was finally convened in December 2023, and all the beneficiaries executed the consent.






4.
It was the Administrator/Applicant’s averment that, in addition to the logistical challenges of convening a meeting, they also faced financial challenges. By the time the family had sorted out its financial challenges and filed the Summons for Confirmation dated 29 December 2023, the matter had already been dismissed by the Court.






5.
From the proceedings, the matter was placed before the Deputy Registrar on 20th December 2022, when the Court directed that notice do issue to the Administrator for reactivation/closure of the file. The same came up for directions on 16th January 2023, when parties were absent. The file was subsequently closed.






6.
Article 159 (2) (b) of 
The Constitution
 provides that courts and tribunals shall be guided by the principle that justice shall not be delayed. It is the duty of the court, Advocates and litigants to ensure that matters are concluded expeditiously without inexcusable delay. This principle is encapsulated in sections 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Cap 21 of the Laws of Kenya.






7.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, this court enjoys a wide discretion over matters and issues before it, including the question as to whether or not it should reinstate a suit dismissed on account of non-attendance.






8.
The Administrator/Applicant has explained the reason why she was unable to file for confirmation of Grant. It is notable that whereas the file was closed in January 2023, it was only until February 2024 that the Administrator/Applicant moved the court to reinstate the matter. Although the delay cannot be said to be inordinate, the Administrator/Applicant has sufficiently explained the financial challenges she faced, which affected her ability to properly instruct counsel.






9.
One of the issues that confronts me is the need for expeditious conclusion of suits. With this in mind, I order as follows:
i.
The Summons dated 29th February 2024 is hereby allowed.
ii.
The Summons for Confirmation of Grant dated 29th December 2023 shall be set down for hearing forthwith;
iii.
Mention on 10th September 2024 before the Deputy Registrar for purposes of fixing a hearing date for the Summons for Confirmation of Grant;
iv.
Costs in the cause
