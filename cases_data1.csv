A brief background of the present contempt of Court proceedings


1.
On 23
rd
 August, 2024, the 1
st
 Petitioner approached this Court via a Notice of Motion application under Certificate of Urgency alleging the abduction/arrest of the 2
nd
 – 4
th
 Petitioners on 19
th
 August, 2024 by persons who had introduced themselves as police officers. They were then kept incommunicado in undisclosed locations after the incident. This Court issued exparte orders in the first instance as follows: -
1.
That pending the hearing and determination of this application interpartes an order is hereby issued directing the Respondents to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the 2nd to 4th Petitioners to the 1st Petitioner.
2.
That pending the hearing and determination of this Application Inter partes an order is hereby issued directing the Respondents to immediately release or produce the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 Petitioners before any Court of competent jurisdiction to make such orders as may be appropriate to uphold the rights and fundamental freedoms of the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 Petitioners.
4.
The matter was then fixed for mention on Monday, 26
th
 August, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. to confirm compliance.






2.
During the virtual session held on 26
th
 August, 2024 only the Advocate for the Petitioners M/s Omwenga appeared. She informed the Court that the orders made on 23/8/2024 were duly served the as was evidenced by the affidavit of service. However, there neither appearance by any Respondents nor responses to the habeas corpus application. There had been no compliance with the orders either. That necessitated Court to vary its orders in which it directed that:
i.
Pending the institution of charges, (if any), the Court now directs unconditional release of 2
nd
 – 4
th
 Petitioners by the 1
st
 Respondent.
ii.
That physical service of the order be effected by close of business that day.
iii.
That a summons to issue to the 1
st
 Respondent to appear in court on the next mention to explain why the habeas corpus orders issued by the court were not complied with. The matter was fixed for Mention on 3
rd
 September, 2024.






3.
On the morning of 3
rd
 of September, 2024, the Attorney General, the DPP and the Director of National Intelligence Service, the Inspector General of Police and Directorate of Criminal Investigations appeared through counsel. None of them had filed response to the application and the orders of 23
rd
 August had not been complied with. The Inspector General of Police who Court had summoned did not turn up either. The court postponed the matter to 3.00 p.m. for physical attendance of the Inspector General to explain why the habeas corpus orders had not been adhered to. The afternoon came and passed; the Inspector General of Police did not attend. The Court was informed that he was out of Office on official business with the nature of business being revealed to be a workshop he was attending Mombasa on budgeting that particular morning. In the afternoon, the Court was told that he was engaged in security operational duties in the Coastal region.






4.
The matter was rescheduled to 5
th
 September, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. as the Court was keen to establish why the habeas corpus orders could not be executed in respect to the production before court or release of the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 Petitioners.






5.
M/s Mwangi who appeared for the Inspector General explained as follows when pressed to explain the apparent persistent disregard of the Court summons by the Inspector General of Police:
“
The Inspector General has not said he is not coming, he is requesting for another date because it is our position that the 2
nd
-4
th
 petitioners are not with the police. The Inspector General is requesting another date to appear because we had thought his officers would explain.
The Inspector General is requesting another date to appear in court (after holding brief consultation), the Inspector General will come on Monday 9
th
 September, 2024.
The officers of Inspector General are here and have confirmed his availability of Monday considering his work and duties.”






6.
The Court after this brief session fixed the matter for 3.00 P.M on the same day. Despite the Court convening, the Inspector General did not show up. The Court finally and reluctantly agreed to give the final opportunity to the Inspector General to attend Court coinciding with the date that Counsel for Inspector General indicated he would be available (this was after she made some consultations). The date was Monday 9
th
 September, 2024. On that day, the distressingly wrote:
“
The stream of reasons and excuses by the Inspector General of Police are definitely bound to run out. To proceed at this juncture and hastily make a finding of contempt of court may be seen as premature in a grave matter of contempt of court which is a form of a criminal sanction being an offence against the administration of Justice. Our Constitution requires a high threshold for criminal matters. Reluctantly, the reasons for non-attendance today must thus be considered…It is thus necessary that I postpone these proceedings to Monday 9
th
 September, 2024. The Inspector General having earlier indicated his availability on this particular day should have no further excuse but to comply and attend court physically at 10.00 a.m. so that this court can put this matter to an end…”






7.
Due to the persistent non-compliance with both the Court summons as well as failure to comply with the order of 23
rd
 August, 2024 the Court opined that it was a case of contemptuous conduct that the Inspector General needed to purge even as it set the date of 9/9/2024. That date came and passed too. The Inspector General did not turn up but he made last-minute attempt and sent his Deputy Inspector General In charge of Kenya Police appear on his behalf. The Court rejected the noting that the open defiance of the court summons had metamorphosed to contemptuous conduct and was now a personal matter that had to be directly and specifically addressed by the person summoned. Following the 7
th
 failure to attend Court or comply with the Court order of 23
rd
 August, 2023 the Court entered a finding of guilty for contempt of Court against the Acting Inspector General of Police on 9/9/2024 and deferred the sentence to today, Friday 13/9/2024.








Sentence


8.
As part of the considering the appropriate sentence, I had to contextualize the matter from a Constitutional view point.






9.
The preamble to 
the Constitution
 reflects the commitment of the people of Kenya to attain a number of aspirations. One of them is statement number 6 of the preamble which is states as follows: ‘RECOGNISING the aspirations of all Kenyans for a government based on essential values of human rights, equality, freedom, democracy and social justice and the rule of law.’






10.
The Constitution
 under that Article 2 (1) proclaims itself as the Supreme law of the land that binds all persons and all state organs. Article 3 obligates every person to respect, uphold and defend 
the Constitution
. It matters not whether they are mighty or low.






11.
The Constitution
 further proceeds to specify the national values and principles of governance that bind all State organs and all persons whenever they make and implement public policy decisions, enact laws and interpret. Among those values and principles that are contained is Article 10 (2) b which has human rights, the rule of law among others whereas Article 10 (2) (c) has the principle of accountability.






12.
In matters of national security, Article 238 provides that the principles which shall apply and include the following, that - a) national security is subject to the authority of 
the Constitution
 and; (b) national security shall be pursued in compliance with the law and with utmost respect for the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.






13.
The rule of law principle is thus a common thread that 
the Constitution
 heavily demands in almost every function to ensure that every person is held accountable to the law. It ensures equality of all before the law and prevents arbitrariness. The task of the Court is to ensures there is a fair balance by applying the law when disputes arise either between state and its citizens or between citizens themselves or between state organs or agencies. Neither a state organ or its officers or individual is above the reach of the law as 
the Constitution
 in Article 2 (1) declares. The power of the Court to adjudicate disputes according to the law is a delegation by the people pursuant to Article 159 which states that ‘Judicial authority is derived from the people and vests in, and shall be exercised by, courts and tribunals established by or under 
the Constitution
.’  The power is exercised subject only to 
the Constitution
 and the law and is not subject to the control or direction of any person or authority (Article 160 (1).






14.
The following excerpt from the South African Constitutional Court case of Secretary of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State v Zuma and Others (CCT 52/21) [2021] ZACC 18; 2021 (9) BCLR 992 (CC); 
2021 (5) SA 327 (CC)
 (29 June 2021) Sums up the position of court orders in a Constitutional democracy. The Court held:
“
…orders and decisions issued by a court bind all persons to whom and organs of State to which they apply, and no person or organ of State may interfere, in any manner, with the functioning of the courts. It follows from this that disobedience towards court orders or decisions risks rendering our courts impotent and judicial authority a mere mockery. The effectiveness of court orders or decisions is substantially determined by the assurance that they will be enforced by all and sundry, including organs of State. In doing so, courts are not only giving effect to the rights of the successful litigant but also and more importantly, by acting as guardians of 
the Constitution
, asserting their authority in the public interest…”






15.
In Civil Application No. Nai 1 of 2017; Dr. Fred Matiang’i-The Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government vs Miguna Miguna and 4 others the Court of Appeal affirming the power punish for contempt held thus:
“
… When Courts issue orders, they do so not as suggestions or pleas to the persons at whom they are directed. Court orders issue ex cathedra, are compulsive, peremptory and expressly binding. It is not for any party; be he high or low, weak or mighty and quite regardless of his status or standing in society, to decide whether or not to obey; to choose which to obey and which to ignore or to negotiate the manner of his compliance. This Court, as must all courts, will deal firmly and decisively with any party who deigns to disobey court orders and will do so not only to preserve its own authority and dignity but the more to ensure and demonstrate that the constitutional edicts of equality under the law, and the upholding of the rule of law are not mere platitudes but present realities…”






16.
This Court entered a finding of guilty on 9/9/2024 after all efforts afforded to the contemnor to purge the contempt were ignored. This was to ensure its authority and dignity which it exercises on behalf public does not get annihilated leading to situation of impunity and anarchy. The Supreme Court inGithiga & 5 others v Kiru Tea Factory Company Ltd (Petiti
on 13 of 2019
) [2023] KESC 41 (KLR) (16 June 2023) (Judgment) Neutral citation: [2023] KESC 41 (KLR) acknowledged that Courts have inherent power to punish for contempt to vindicate their authority besides pin-pointing the source of this authority for Kenyan courts to punish for contempt after the declaration of unconstitutionality of 
Contempt of Court Act
 2016. The Court stated:
“
… Courts possess the inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through sanctions imposed through contempt of court. We note that the 
Contempt of Court Act
 having been declared unconstitutional in Kenya Human Rights Commission v Attorney General & Another [2018] eKLR on November 9, 2018 the instructive provision remains section 5(1) of the 
Judicature Act
 which grants the High Court and the Court of Appeal the power to punish for contempt. It provides:(1) The High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have the same power to punish for contempt of court as is for the time being possessed by the High Court of Justice in England and that power shall extend to upholding the authority and dignity of subordinate courts...”






17.
Today, this Court is required to pass the sentence for contempt of Court. The principles to be considered in determining an effective sentence in a contempt of court case were considered by the South African Constitutional Court in Jacob Zuma case (supra) where the Court discussed the ‘coercive’ versus ‘punitive order’ and explained the difference between the two approaches as follows:
“
…There is a distinction between coercive and punitive orders, which differences are “marked and important”. A coercive order gives the respondent the opportunity to avoid imprisonment by complying with the original order and desisting from the offensive conduct. Such an order is made primarily to ensure the effectiveness of the original order by bringing about compliance. A final characteristic is that it only incidentally vindicates the authority of the court that has been disobeyed. Conversely, the following are the characteristics of a punitive order: a sentence of imprisonment cannot be avoided by any action on the part of the respondent to comply with the original order; the sentence is unsuspended; it is related both to the seriousness of the default and the contumacy of the respondent; and the order is influenced by the need to assert the authority and dignity of the court, to set an example for others…”






18.
The Court then went ahead and found that the conduct of the contemnor, Mr. Zuma had made it undesirable to benefit from a ‘coercive order’ reasoning thus:
“
… A coercive order would be both futile and inappropriate in these circumstances. Coercive committal, through a suspended sentence, uses the threat of imprisonment to compel compliance. Yet, it is incontrovertible that Mr Zuma has no intention of attending the Commission, having repeatedly reiterated that he would rather be committed to imprisonment than co-operate with the Commission or comply with the order of this Court. Accordingly, a suspended sentence, being a coercive order, would yield nothing…”






19.
The contemnor herein casually treated every possible opportunity accorded to him by this Court to purge the contempt to the extent that attending a workshop in Mombasa which he considered more important than obeying court summons on the whereabouts of the 2
nd
 to 4th Petitioners.






20.
Deliberate defiance of court orders breeds impunity particularly when it is done by those entrusted with public power as it is inconsistent with the purposes and objects of 
the Constitution
.






21.
In passing this sentence, I am conscious that it is directed to the highest ranked police officer in this Country. He is still in office. That might pose a challenge in the enforcement of the order since in police service, seniority is highly regarded. That cannot deter me from pursuing and standing firm in the defence of the aspirations of Kenyan people who desired at the time of enacting this Constitution to have a country that is governed by adherence to the rule of law. Part of the oath office that I took as a Judge states that:
“
…I will at all times, and to the best of my knowledge and ability, protect, administer, and defend this Constitution with a view to upholding the dignity and the respect for the Judiciary and judicial system of Kenya…”






22.
The Constitution
 of this Country is supreme and Article 2 (1) reiterates that by stating that it binds all persons and all state organs. No man or State organ or authority is above 
the Constitution
. 
The Constitution
 command through this Court is that I uphold the rule of law by protecting the integrity of the Judicial System.






23.
The significance of this sentence today is to vindicate the cherished principle of the rule of law in our constitutional democracy by restoring the dignity and authority of this Court in public interest. Borrowing from the South Africa Constitutional Court decision, the contemnor shall thus serve sentence as follows:
1.
The contemnor, Mr. Gilbert Masengeli is sentenced to six 6 months’ imprisonment.
2.
Mr. Gilbert Masengeli is ordered to submit himself to the Commissioner General of the Kenya Prisons Service to ensure that he is to be committed to a prison facility to commence serving the sentence of imprisonment imposed.
3.
In the event that Gilbert Masengeli does not submit himself to the Commissioner General of Kenya Prison Service as ordered, the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and National Security must take all steps that are necessary and permissible in law to ensure that Mr Gilbert Masengeli is committed to Prison to commence serving the sentence imposed on him.
4.
The Court nevertheless considers it desirable to impose a ‘coercive order’ as opposed to a ‘punitive order’. In this regard, Mr. Gilbert Masengeli can avoid serving the sentence if he complies with the direction to obey the court summons. I thus, suspend this sentence for Seven (7) days only. The Acting Inspector General of Police can redeem himself and comply by availing himself before the Court in person to answer to the issues he has been avoiding within Seven (7 days. In default, the Sentence shall automatically become effective.

Judgment










Introduction


1.
By a Memorandum of Appeal dated 4
th
 December 2023, the appellant challenges the said lower court’s decision on the following grounds: -
a.
The learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to notice that a party is bound by their pleadings and was not pleaded in the claim, Mr.Kingori (Respondent Supervisor) effected termination of employment;
b.
That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find and hold that the suit before her was not proven in law and in failing to dismiss that suit for bad pleadings;
c.
That the learned Trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by failing to find and hold that the evidence which the respondent led in an attempt at proving his claim was at variance with his pleadings and failed to find that the respondent did not prove his claim in that suit.
d.
That the learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider the written submissions of the appellants on record and the authorities annexed therein in support of the appellant’s case while arriving at the award in damages.
e.
That the judgment of the learned trial magistrate is against the law and weight of the evidence on record and against the doctrine of stare decisis.
f.
The trial court erred in failing to evaluate and consider the Respondent (Appellant) witness evidence that, “I tried to reach him through the number given above. He told me he had gotten another job”.
g.
The trial court erred in finding that the appellant had to subject the respondent upon the procedure of a notice and a hearing as envisaged in section 41 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 whereas the contract had long been terminated on 01.6.2022 by the claimant’s resignation by his conduct of absenteeism/absconding.
h.
The trial court erred in finding that the claimant had worked for the Respondent for about nine months and Awarding the claimant salaries for October 2021, November 2021 and December 2021 without proper evidence and pleading.
i.
The trial court erred in finding that even if the claimant had absconded from work, he ought to have been given a notice and a hearing when he purported to resume duty.
j.
The trial court erred in finding that the respondent was unfairly and unlawfully terminated from employment by the appellant and making an award of one-month’s salary in lieu of notice and 6 months’ salary compensation.
k.
The trial court erred and contravened the General Wages Order in Awarding the claimant nine months Housing Allowance and Leave Allowance.
l.
The trial court erred in arriving at contradictory findings on absconding from work by the claimant and while on the other faulting the appellant for failing to make reasonable attempts to contact the respondent once he had absconded his duties and thus ultimately arriving at a wrong conclusion that the claimant was unfairly terminated from employment by the appellant.






2.
The appellant seeks the following reliefs: -
a.
The appeal be allowed.
b.
That part of the Judgment delivered on 22.11.2023 making an award for unpaid salary for the month of October 2021, November 2021, December 2021, one month’s salary in lieu of notice, and six months’ salary for compensation for unfair termination and decree herein be set aside in their entirety and substituted with an order for dismissal of those three awards with costs to the appellant.
c.
That part of the judgment delivered on 22.11.2023 contravening the General Wages Order in Awarding the claimant nine months Housing Allowance and Leave Allowance be corrected.
d.
Such further or other orders as this Honouable court may deem just and expedient.
e.
Costs of the appeal be borne by the respondent.








Factual background


3.
The respondent was employed by the appellant as a security guard from September 2021 until 2
nd
 June 2022 when they separated. Subsequently, the respondent filed suit in the lower court alleging that his employment had been unfairly terminated by the appellant on 2
nd
 June 2022 and his terminal dues were withheld. Therefore, he sought compensation for unfair termination plus accrued employment benefits totalling to Kshs.178,000. He further prayed for certificate of service, costs and interest.






4.
The appellant denied liability for unfair termination and averred that the respondent failed to report to his new work station on 2
nd
 June 2022 after a lawful transfer from Nebo Hospital to Mpeta. The reason for the transfer was because the client had rejected him. The appellant denied that it terminated the respondent’s employment and maintained that the claimant absconded work after the said transfer and failed to handover his uniform.






5.
The appellant further denied the reliefs sought by the respondent and maintained that it paid him all his salary according to the General Wage 
Order of 2018
. It further averred that the NSSF and NHIF deductions were duly remitted as required by the law.






6.
The appellant counterclaimed against the claimant Kshs.2,280 being the value of the uniform that he failed to handover after leaving employment. Therefore, it prayed for the suit to be dismissed with costs.






7.
Each side called one witnesses who adopted their written statements as evidence in chief and produced bundle of documents as exhibits. The claimant contended that he was dismissed in May 2022 by his supervisor Mr.Kingori via phone call and informed Mr.Joseph Koech. He contended that his salary was Kshs.8,000.00 per month and that he was not given notice prior to the termination. He was not paid salary for September, October, November and December 2021 plus January 2022.






8.
Mr.Joseph Kingori (DW1) stated that he transferred the respondent to Mpeta Guest House with effect from 2
nd
 June 2022 after a client complained about reporting to work late. The respondent refused to report to his new work station. He called the claimant but he said that he had secured another job. He was then paid his salary for May 2022 through Mpesa. Subsequently, he complained that he had not received his salary for January and May 2022.






9.
DW1 contended that he had no authority to fire any employee but only to hire. The power to fire was bestowed upon Mr.Kenya, Manager Mr.Joseph Koech or the HR Manager. He contended that the respondent signed for the uniform given including shirt, trouser, sweater and raincoat but the document he signed was not produced in court. He maintained that the respondent failed to return the uniform even after being verbally warned.






10.
After the hearing, both sides filed submissions and the trial court (Hon.Gituma, SRM) rendered the impugned judgment in favour of the respondent whereby she found that a case of unlawful termination had been proved and awarded him six month’s salary as compensation for unlawful termination, salary in lieu of notice, salary for October-December 2021, refund of NHIF and NSSF deductions, prorate leave and house allowance totalling to Kshs.100,400.00. Further, a certificate of service was awarded plus costs and interest.








Submissions in this appeal


11.
It was submitted that the respondent did not plead that he was dismissed by Mr.Kingori but during his evidence he stated that he was dismissed by Mr.Kingori, his supervisor in May 2022. Consequently, the trial court allowed the respondent to violate the principles of pleadings.






12.
It was further submitted that the respondent prayed for unpaid salary for September-December 2021 plus January 2022 equalling to Kshs.48,000 yet in his statement of claim he pleaded that he was not paid salary for January and May 2022. Consequently, it was urged that the court awarded salary for October-December 2021 based on contradictory evidence. It was contended that the written statement and the oral testimony by the respondent were inconsistent.






13.
It was further submitted that the award of six months’ salary compensation (Kshs.48,000) was made without considering the fact that the respondent had only served for nine (9) months before separation. Further, that the court failed to consider the Judicial precedents cited and the evidence adduced by the parties. Also, the court did not consider section 49 (4) (b) and (k) of the 
Employment Act
 which deals with the circumstances under which the termination including the extent to which the employee caused or contributed to the termination.






14.
Reliance was placed on the case of Xforce Security Solution (KE) Ltd v Samuel Tsimba Ndonga (not availed to court) where the court held that desertion of duty amounts to resignation by conduct of the employee’s absence without leave or lawful cause. Consequently, in the present case the appellant prayed for the appeal to be allowed with costs.






15.
On the other hand, it was submitted for the respondent that he led evidence based on the pleadings and produced supporting documents. It was argued that the trial court properly evaluated the evidence and arrived at correct finding that the appellant had terminated his employment without following procedure laid down by Section 41 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 since no reason was given and notice or hearing accorded to him.






16.
It was submitted that, Mr.Kingori terminated the respondent’s employment in May 2022 and therefore there is no way he could report to work the following month. Further, it was submitted that the appellant did not produce any documents to prove that he was paid all salary as alleged. It was argued that section 74 of the 
Employment Act
 requires an employer to keep employees records but in this case such records were not produced in this case to prove payment of salary and remittances of statutory deductions.






17.
It was submitted that the court was right in finding that the respondents’ employment was unlawfully terminated contrary to section 41, 43, 44 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
,2007 and that the claimant was entitled to the reliefs awarded. Reliance was placed on Anthony Mkala Chitavi v Malindi Water & Sewerage Co.Ltd (not availed) and the court was urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.








Determination


18.
This being a first appeal, my mandate is to re-evaluate the evidence on record and make my own independent conclusions. I am guided by the decision of Court of Appeal in the case of Selle v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd (1968) EA 123 where the court held thus: -
“
The appellate court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from a trial by the High Court is by way of a retrial and the principles upon which the Court of Appeal acts are that the court must consider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, the court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial Judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate he evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






19.
Having perused through the record of appeal carefully, the following issues fall for determination: -
a.
Whether the respondent was dismissed by the appellant or he absconded duty.
b.
If the answer in (a) above is dismissal, whether the same was unlawful and unfair.
c.
Whether reliefs sought was merited.






Dismissal or absconding


20.
Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 provides that he who seeks court’s judgment on a matter he must adduce evidence to prove his allegations. The respondent alleged that his employment was terminated by his supervisor, Mr.Kingori in May 2022. He contended that he called the supervisor over the phone and in response he dismissed him for no reason and without prior notice.






21.
The appellant, on the other hand contended that the respondent was rejected in his work station at Nebo Hospital and he was transferred to Mpeta Guest House. However, he failed to report to work on 2
nd
 June 2022 and when he reached him over the phone, he responded that he had secured another job.






22.
Having considered the evidence on record, I have noted that the respondent did not indicate the date when he called the supervisor and received the termination of his employment. He also did not state the reason why he called the supervisor and he did not state the date he called Mr.Koech about the dismissal by Mr.Kingori. Consequently, I find that the respondent did not adduce sufficient evidence to prove, on a balance of probability, that he was dismissed from employment by his supervisor Mr.Kingori.






23.
If that was true, he would have pleaded the date of the dismissal and the person who dismissed him and then support by evidence. Without such pleading and evidence, I must hold that the respondent was not dismissed from his employment by the appellant.






24.
There is however, evidence to show that the respondent absconded work. The appellant has produced Dispatch No.299 dated 1
st
 June 2022 indicating that the respondent was transferred from Nebo Hospital to Mpeta. The Dispatch was signed by DW1 (Mr.Kingori). There is also a Transfer Form dated 30
th
 May 2022 transferring the respondent from Nebo Hospital to Mpeta effective from 1
st
 June 2022. The respondent did not challenge the authenticity of the said documents. Consequently, I reiterate that the respondent refused transfer and absconded work. He is therefore to blame for the termination of his employment and as such the claim for unlawful termination is a non-starter.








Reliefs


25.
In view of the foregoing finding, I find that the respondent is not entitled to declaration that his employment was unfairly terminated. He is also not entitled to compensation for unfair termination or salary in lieu of notice under section 49 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007. To that extent, I find that the trial court erred in law and fact in finding that the respondent’s employment was unfairly terminated by the appellant.






26.
As regards the prayer for annual leave, there is no dispute that the respondent worked for nine (9) months and he earned leave at the rate of 1.75 leave days per month. Hence 1.75 X 9 =15.75 leave days. Based on salary of Kshs.8000 X 15.5/30 =Kshs.4,200.00. Accordingly, I agree with the trial court on the same.






27.
The claim for unpaid salary was for September 2021 – January 2022 equalling to five (5) months. The appellant filed payrolls for September 2021, and January 2022 but failed to produce pay roll for the other months. Therefore, the respondent is entitled to salary for October - December 2021 being Kshs.8000 X 3 = Kshs.24,000. On this amount, I agree with the trial court.






28.
The respondent also accused the appellant of not remitting NSSF and NHIF contribution amounting to Kshs.1800 and Kshs.3600 respectively. However, he did not prove by evidence that the said money was deducted from his salary by the employer. I say so because the pay rolls produced did not indicate any statutory deductions and the bank statement produced by the respondent indicates that Kshs.8000 or other lesser amounts earned were credited in his account. The payment was paid without any deductions. Consequently, the award of the said sum by the trial court was not based on evidence and it is set aside.






29.
As regards the claim for house allowance, there is no evidence that the respondent was provided with housing by the appellant. Consequently, the appellant was required under section 31 of the 
Employment Act
 to pay the respondent house allowance. The courts have adopted a rate of 15% of the basic pay as reasonable house allowance. Hence Kshs.8000 X 15/100 X 9 months=Kshs.10,800. On that, I find that the trial court did not err in making that award.










Conclusion


30.
I have found that the respondent did not prove on a balance of probability, that his employment was terminated by the appellant but rather he absconded work as such is not entitled to compensatory damages under section 49 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007. I have also found that he has not proved the claim for unremitted NSSF and NHIF contributions. He is however entitled to unpaid salary for October – December 2021, 15.75 leave days, and house allowance for nine months. Consequently, I allow the appeal as highlighted and vary the impugned judgment in terms of the following orders: -
a.
Unpaid salary………………………………………………Kshs.24,000.00
b.
Leave………………………………………………………….Kshs. 4,200.00
c.
House Allowance…………………………………………Kshs.10,800.00
Kshs.39,100.00
d.
The award is subject to statutory deductions.
e.
The award of costs and interest awarded by the trial court remain unchanged.
f.
Since the appeal has partially succeeded, each party shall bear own costs of the Appeal.

Cost of the suit to the claimant.






2.
The respondent denied liability and averred that the grievants were employed on casual basis and as such the alleged redundancy does not arise. It further averred that the settlement agreement signed during the conciliation before the Labour Officer was not voluntary. Therefore, it prayed for the suit to be dismissed with costs.








Evidence


3.
Elijah Kuria Mwangi, 1
st
 grievant testified as CW1. His evidence was that he was employed by the respondent as a Sales Manager from 2
nd
 January 2017 for a monthly salary of Kshs.15,000 but later it was increased up to Kshs.22,000. He was placed in charge of the other 14 employees. He worked for a total of 4 years without any warning until December 2021 when he was told by the Director, Mr.Reuben Kabiro to go home and wait until he was called back. He complied but he was never called back.






4.
On his cross examination, he contended that he was employed verbally and that he had known the Director before the engagement. He confirmed that his salary was paid through Mpesa. He contended that in December 2021, the Director told him to inform the other employees to proceed on Christmas holiday and wait until they were called back and he did so. During his 4 years’ service, he never went on leave due to pressure of work. He denied that the respondent was wound up and contended that the business was still operational.






5.
Mr.Peter Macharia Maina, 2
nd
 grievant testified as CW2. His evidence was that he was employed by the respondent as a Driver from 2017 earning Kshs.500 per day but later it was increased to Kshs.900 per day. His duties included transport of Chain link and charcoal. He worked until October 2021 when he was told to go home and await until he was called back.






6.
On cross examination, he contended that he was employed verbally. He was driving a lorry or a smaller vehicle depending on the size of the cargo ordered. He never went for any annual leave and he was working continuously. He was receiving instructions from CW1 and not the Director. He was stopped from attending work on 27
th
 October 2021 and he was never called back. He sees the Director still driving the respondent’s vehicles. He is not aware whether the respondent is still operating.






7.
The 3
rd
 grievant, Mr.Nelson Njuguna Kamau testified as CW3. His evidence was that he was employed by the respondent on 17
th
 October 2017 as a Sales person. His monthly salary was Kshs.12,000 but it was later increased to Kshs.15,000. He never went for any annual leave until 30
th
 March 2020, when he was told not to report to work the following day due to Covid-19 and instead wait until he was called back. He used to work from 6.00am to 8.00pm and he never went on any annual leave due to pressure of work.






8.
During cross examination, he confirmed that he was employed orally by the respondent but he was receiving instructions from CW1.






9.
He further confirmed that he left employment before the respondent started charcoal business. He was told to go home by Mr.Reuben Kabiro and wait until he was called back and when he received no call he visited the home of Reuben severally and he told him to wait until he was called back. The last time he visited the home was in December 2021.






10.
He confirmed that a settlement agreement was voluntarily signed on 23
rd
 November 2022 at Labour Office. He was present when the agreement was signed and there was no threat to anyone before signing. He contended that Mr.Reuben Kabiro simply admitted liability and signed the agreement.






11.
The respondent called two witnesses. Ms.Catherine Wanjiru testified as RW1. She stated that she was employed by the respondent on casual basis depending on availability of work. She confirmed that the grievants were among the fifteen casual employees of the respondent. She worked until 2021 but just like the other employees, she was working intermittedly even with intervals of a whole week. The company was closed in 2021 because it was not doing well and its assets were attached.






12.
She stated that the employees were told to go home and wait to be called back but they were never called back to work. She confirmed that the employees never used to go for annual leave but they rested when there was no materials.






13.
On cross examination, she stated that she was employed as a coordinator to assist CW1. When CW1 delivered cargo, she would take cheques to the bank. She denied being a partner or wife to Reuben Kabiro and maintained that she was an employee on a daily stipend.






14.
Reuben Kabiro testified as RW2. He contended that he employed the grievants on casual basis and they are his friends. RW1 was also one of his casual employees and he used to call them to work when he had materials. The business went under in 2020 due to Covid-19 and he explained the challenges to the workers. He then told them that he would call them back after work improved. However, the operations never resumed.






15.
He contended that the grievants were not entitled to annual leave because they were not in continuous employment. He further contended that he started charcoal business before employing the grievants and he never employed them in the charcoal business.






16.
He admitted that he signed an agreement at the Labour office but stated that he did so under duress. He contended that he was told to sign or else he be taken to the police station.






17.
On cross examination, he contended that the grievants were sometimes not attending work for a week or even three weeks when there were no materials. However, he admitted that the Mpesa statement filed showed continuous payment. He further admitted that he never reported to the Labour office that work was going down.






18.
He contended that the grievants never told him that they were trade union members and stated that the union officials threatened to take him to the police if he failed to sign the agreement. He admitted that he had no evidence of the said threat or prove that the company vehicles had been sold after the attachment but contended that the grievants lied when they said that they see him driving the vehicles. He contended that the vehicles were to be returned upon payment of the loans but he lacked money to pay the same.








Submissions


19.
It was submitted for the claimant that no evidence has been tendered by the employer to rebut the evidence by CW1 and CW2 that the company made big income during Covid-19 pandemic. Further, the respondent has failed to adduce evidence to prove that RW2 signed settlement agreement under threat during the conciliation process.






20.
It was argued that, if in deed RW1 signed the agreement under duress, he should have filed complaint with the police. Consequently, the court was urged to award the reliefs sought because they were laid off unfairly.






21.
On the other hand, it was submitted for the respondent that the grievants were orally employed and in the same way they were relieved from work until things improve. However, things never improved and the grievants lodged claim through the claimant’s union. It was submitted that the grievants membership to the claimant was suspect.






22.
It was further submitted that the grievants were casual employees on need basis and contended that the claimant has not adduced evidence of monthly salaries. It was further submitted that the claimant is not entitled to the reliefs sought and further submitted that the agreement dated 23
rd
 November 2022 was signed under duress and it has rescinded it. Finally, it was submitted that the company has since been wound up after its assets were attached by financier using auctioneers.








Analysis and determination


23.
I have considered the pleadings, evidence and submissions. There is no dispute that the grievants were employees of the respondent from diverse dates in 2017 to diverse dates in 2021. The issues for determination are: -
a.
Whether the grievants were casual employees or employees for indefinite period.
b.
Whether the grievants’ employment was unfairly and unlawfully terminated.
c.
Whether the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought.








Casual or regular employment


24.
Casual employment refers to a case when an employee is hired for not more than 24 hours and for a daily wage. Notice is not required before termination. Regular employment on the other hand is one where the employee is employed on a monthly salary for an indefinite period terminable by notice of at least 28 days in writing. (See section 35 (1) (c) of the 
Employment Act
).






25.
In the instant case, the claimant had adduced Mpesa statements which show that the grievants were receiving both daily payments and monthly payments. The payments were consistent with persons on continuous service. The payment was made from the Mpesa account of RW2, respondent’s director. Even if they were intended to be casual workers, their employment converted to regular employment under section 37 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 due to their continuous service as casual employees.








Unfair and unlawful termination


26.
The respondent confessed that it stopped grievants from work due to operational challenges caused by effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the claimant is right that the separation herein was on account of redundancy but done in violation of the mandatory procedure set out under section 40 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 which provides that: -
“
(1)
An employer shall not terminate a contract of service on account of redundancy unless the employer complies with the following conditions—
(a)
where the employee is a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the union to which the employee is a member and the labour officer in charge of the area where the employee is employed of the reasons for, and the extent of, the intended redundancy not less than a month prior to the date of the intended date of termination on account of redundancy;
(b)
where an employee is not a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the employee personally in writing and the labour officer;
(c)
the employer has, in the selection of employees to be declared redundant had due regard to seniority in time and to the skill, ability and reliability of each employee of the particular class of employees affected by the redundancy;
(d)
where there is in existence a collective agreement between an employer and a trade union setting out terminal benefits payable upon redundancy; the employer has not placed the employee at a disadvantage for being or not being a member of the trade union;
(e)
the employer has where leave is due to an employee who is declared redundant, paid off the leave in cash;
(f)
the employer has paid an employee declared redundant not less than one month’s notice or one month’s wages in lieu of notice; and
(g)
the employer has paid to an employee declared redundant severance pay at the rate of not less than fifteen days’ pay for each completed year of service.”






27.
The respondent did not rebut the claimant’s case that the termination was done without following fair procedure. Consequently, I find and hold that the failure to adhere to the said statutory procedure rendered the termination of the grievant’s employment unfair and unlawful.








Reliefs


28.
The claimant prayed for payment of salary in lieu of notice, accrued leave, service, public holidays, unpaid salary, salary underpayments and compensation for unlawful redundancy. The parties have also brought to the attention of this court that the matter was referred to conciliation under section 62 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 and a settlement agreement was signed by the parties on 23
rd
 November 2022 between the parties herein and witnessed by the conciliator at the sub-county Labour office, Thika.






29.
Although the respondent contends that RW2 signed the agreement through duress, no evidence of such coercion has been tendered. His conduct after signing the agreement did not align with that of a person who has been coerced into committing himself to pay the money reflected in the said agreement. Consequently, I find that the settlement agreement dated 23
rd
 November 2022 was signed by the parties voluntarily after understanding the nature and the implication of the contents therein to each party.






30.
Article 159 (2) (c) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 obligates this court to promote alternative forms of dispute resolution including reconciliation, mediation, arbitration among others. The parties herein submitted themselves to conciliation process before a conciliator appointed under section 66 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 and resolved the dispute herein under section 67 vide the agreement dated 23
rd
 November 2022.






31.
Section 68 of the Act provides that: -
“
(1)
If a trade dispute is settled in conciliation, the terms of the agreement shall be-
a.
Recorded in writing; and
b.
Signed by the parties and the conciliator.”






32.
Having considered the agreement dated 23
rd
 November 2022, I am satisfied that it is on all fours with the above provisions and the matter was resolved thereby. Consequently, I will recognise and respect the aforesaid settlement agreement and adopt it as the judgment of this court.








Conclusion


33.
I have found that the claimants were regular employees for an indefinite period. I have also found that the parties resolved the dispute through conciliation vide an agreement dated 23
rd
 November, 2022. Consequently, I enter judgment for the claimant in terms of the said agreement as follows: -

Judgment










1.
This Judgement relates to the proceedings initiated in respect of notices issued by the Landlord to alter the terms of the tenancy of the four(4) Tenants herein. The four (4) termination notices are dated the 30/07/2019 and are all anchored on section 4(2) of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
 (Cap 301) hereinafter “the Act”






2.
The four termination notices were issued to the four (4) tenants housed within Land Reference No. 209/4678 as found along Enterprise Road within the Industrial area part of the Nairobi City.






3.
The Landlord in his endeavor to alter the terms of the tenancy by increasing the rent thereof was stated to be on the ground that;-
“
The current rent payable by yourself is far below the fair Open Market Rent payable for comparable premises”






3.
The 1st notice relates to M/S DIASTAR AUTOCARE CENTRE. The same is dated 30/7/2019. It is that notice that triggered the filing of the reference dated 15/8/2019 by M/S DIASTAR. The later objected to the notice by filing the reference which sought for
“
I therefore request the Tribunal to investigate this matter and determine the issues involved”
The Landlord in the notice had sought to increase the rent payable on the premises from Kshs 65,000/= to Kshs 180,000/= exclusive of VAT.
The matter was filed under BPRT case number 826 of 2019.






4.
The 2nd notice was also dated 30/7/2019. It was issued to Paramjit Singh C/o Appar Tech Ltd. In response the Tenant PARAMJIT SINGH filed the reference dated 15/8/2019 under BPRT Case No. 827 of 2019. In this case the Landlord intended to increase the rent payable on the demised premises from Kshs 70,000/= to Kshs 180,000/=






5.
The 3rd notice was also dated 30/7/2019. It sought to increase the rent payable from Kshs 175,000/= to Kshs 280,000/= exclusive of VAT. This triggered the filing of BPRT Case No. 828 of 2019. The notice was addressed to Gurmukh Singh.






7.
The final notice was also of even date just like the others. It was addressed to Paramjit Singh C/O Vishkarma Industries Ltd. The Landlord intended to increase the rent from Kshs 60,000/= to Kshs 260,000/=






8.
When BPRT Case Numbers 826,827,828 and 829 0f 2019 came up for hearing on the 5/12/2019 before Hon. Mbichi Mboroki, the court directed that the four files be consolidated and be heard as BPRT Case No. 828 of 2019.






8.
In the cause of these proceedings, the Tenants filed a notice of preliminary objection dated 1/7/2020. In the notice, they questioned the ability and/or capacity of the Landlord to issue the termination notices dated 30/7/2019. The same was canvassed and by a Ruling delivered by Hon Cyprian N. Mugambi (Chairperson) on the 30/8/2021,the notice of preliminary objection was dismissed with costs to the Landlord.






8.
Being dissatisfied by the said Ruling, the Tenants filed an Appeal vide Nairobi Civil Appeal ELCA Case No E028 of 2023 and which Appeal was also dismissed by the Judgement of the Honourable Justice J. Mogeni delivered on the 27/9/2023.
The Tenants were also condemned to pay the costs of the Appeal to the Landlord.






8.
We have spoken to the history of this matter so that the delay of five (5) years before its conclusion can be understood. After the disposal of the matter by the Environment and Land Court,directions were taken to canvass the reference herein by way of written submissions.






8.
The Landlord’s submissions in respect of all the four (4) Tenants are dated the 30/11/2021 whereas those for the Tenants are dated 21/11/2021. The Landlord also filed the valuation report by M/S Fortune Realtors Ltd which is dated the 5/12/2019 and signed off by one Eng Oyoo B.O, a Registered and Practicing Valuer.






8.
The Tenants on the other hand filed four valuation reports in respect of each of the premises occupied by the four Tenants namely Diastar Autocare Centre, Paramjit Singh c/o Appar Tech Ltd, Gurmukh Singh c/o Nasib Industrial Supplies Limited and Glory Paints, Nairobi and finally Paramjit Singh C/O Vishkarma Industries Ltd.






14.
At this point , we would wish to in brief note the evidence of both parties as the same informs the final determination of this matter;-
A.
The case for the tenants is that;-
(i)
The ideal rent payable by M/S Diastar Autocare Centre is Kshs 68,569/= and not the amount suggested by the Landlord at Kshs 180,000/= from the current rent of Kshs 65,000/=
(ii)
The reasonable rent to be paid by M/S Paramjit Singh T/A Appar Tech Ltd was Kshs 75,206/= and not as suggested by the Landlord at Kshs 180,000/= from the current rent of Kshs 70,000/=
(iii)
The ideal rent to be paid by Gurmukh Singh T/A Nasib Industrial Supplies Limited and Glory Paints,Nairobi was Kshs 163,744/- and not the one suggested by Landlord at Kshs 280,000/= from the current rent of Kshs 175,000/=.
(iv)
That M/S Paramjit Singh T/A Vishkarma Industries should pay Kshs 71,486/= and not Kshs 260,000/= from Kshs 60,000/= as suggested by the Landlord
(v)
The Tenants put reliance on the aforesaid four (4) valuation reports dated the 8/6/2020 signed by M/S S.N Ndirangu and B.K Gachoka both Registered and Practicing Valuers working under the name and style of Value Line Consulting Ltd
(vi)
They had carried out major renovations on the premises and were also paying land rates and rents which required the court’s consideration
(vii)
Their valuation reports reflected the reality on the ground and that the valuation report by the Landlord was misplaced and misleading.
B.
The case for the landlord was that;-
I)
Just like the Tenants, they applied the “Comparison Method of rental values in the neighbourhood in carrying out the rent assessment”
ii)
The valuation was based on the current market value
iii)
The average cost per square foot (sqft) for buidings of the same age with the demised ones were as follows;-
a)
Office space - Kshs 40/= to 45/= per sqft b)Warehouse – Kshs 30/= to 35/= per sqft c)Court Yard Kshs 20/= to 25/= per sqft
iv)
Despite the provided charges for the office, warehouse and court yard as above, the Landlord has charged well below the valuation report @Kshs 35/= for the office, Kshs 30/= for the warehouse and Kshs 15/= for the court yard.
v)
The Tenants have not provided any basis for the recommended rent
vi)
Though most of the tenants did not allow access to their respective premises, the valuers used data available with the Landlord to work on the measurements (sqft) and therefore reach the reasonable rent payable.
vii)
They had demarcated the charges/rent to include those for the offices, storage, warehouse, kitchen and covered yard and which the Tenants’ Valuers had not done
viii)
The notice to alter the terms of the Tenancies herein should therefore be upheld and the same to take effect on the 1/10/2019.






8.
Having perused all the filings by the parties including the respective Affidavits, the valuation reports and submissions, we are of view that the issues for determination in this matter are the following;-
A.
Whether the Landlord’s notices to alter the terms of the Tenants’ respective Tenancies dated 30/7/2019 are merited
B.
When should the proposed rent increment take effect if allowed;and
C.
Who should bear the costs of this suit






8.
Before we delve into the issues as identified herein above, we wish to acknowledge that we have deeply benefitted from the evidence presented by both parties which includes the affidavits, the valuation reports and the submissions thereof and thank both Counsels for the same.






Issue A.-Whether the Landlord’s notice to alter the terms of the Tenants respective Tenancies dated 30/7/2019 are merited


17.
It is unfortunate that it will be exactly five (5) years on the 30/9/2024 since the Landlord intended to have the proposed rent increment effected. We have however outlined the checkered history of this suit and what had led to such inordinate delay before the conclusion of this matter.






18.
In rendering our determination herein, we are alive to the provisions of section 9(2) of the Act which provides that ;-
“
without prejudice to the generality of this section, a Tribunal may upon any reference ;-
a)
Determine or vary the rent to be payable in respect of the controlled tenancy, having regard to the terms thereof and to the rent at which the premises concerned might reasonably be expected to be let in the open market and disregarding-
(i)
any effect on rent of the fact that the tenant has, or his predecessors in title      have, been in occupation of the premises
(ii)
any goodwill attached to the premises by reason of the carrying on thereat of the      trade, business or occupation of the Tenant or any such predecessors
(iii)
any effect on rent of any improvement carried out by the tenant or any such      predecessor otherwise than pursuance of an obligation to the immediate      landlord;
b)
Terminate or vary any of the terms or conditions of the controlled tenancy, or any of      the rights or services enjoyed by the tenant, upon such conditions, if any, as it deems appropriate.






19.
Section 12(1) (b) of the Act further defines some of the powers given to this court as follows;-
“
To determine or vary the rent to be payable in respect of any controlled tenancy, having regard to all the circumstances thereof”






20.
The onerous task and duty of making a decision like in this matter is purely discretionary but the same must be exercised judicially. Courts have on several occasions rendered themselves on the requirements of the exercise of such discretion.






21.
In the case of Cleaners Ltd -vs- Barclays Bank & Co (1972) EA 188, the court of Appeal of East Africa held that;-
“
It is the reasonableness of the rent that must be in the forefront of the Tribunal’s investigations and determination. It must be the concern of this court too. The average rates per square foot or meter of a number of nearby buildings on the ground floor premises in which similar trades are carried out are among other things relevant to assessing the rent that would reasonably be expected in the open market.






22.
Further,in the case of Tala Investment Ltd vs Greensport Ltd, Civil Appeal No 269 of 1993, Justice Shah as he then was, made the following holding;-
“
In dealing with principles upon which a Tribunal should act in assessing rent, its duty is to consider all reports properly before it. The Tribunal must go into individual comparables to decide which is a better report rather than merely arrive at a mean figure of the Landlord’s and the Tenant’s Valuer’s reports. That is not the proper criteria”.






23.
In this matter, we have noted that the Landlord’s Valuer’s report is concise in addressing the issues at play. It has employed the comparison methodology by using at least seven (7) comparables to come up with the various rents charged for the office space, godowns and court yard within the area where the demised premises are situate.






23.
We also appreciate that the valuation report by M/S Fortune Realtors Ltd has addressed age of the premises to include whether new, newly renovated or old and came up with categories of rents in all those obtaining situations.






25.
On the part of the Tenants, though their valuation reports are elaborate and that each report addressed the concerned spaces of the respective Tenants,the reports left out very fundamental information.






26.
All the Tenants’ reports did not address the question of the age of the comparable buildings,the cost of spaces in relation to warehouses and courtyard;and worked with global figures of the comparable premises.This is not helpful to this court. We would therefore go by the report by M/S Fortune Realtors Ltd for the Landlord as the same is the better report,is reasonable and meets the parameters as set down by the law and as explained herein before.






27.
Though none of the parties explained the last time that there was rent increment, it is plain from the market analysis by both Valuers, that there was need for rent increment. It must therefore had taken sometime before the present proposed rent hike which was meant to take effect on the 1/10/2019.






28.
This reality fortifies the Landlord’s intention to increase rents as proposed.






29.
The proposal by the Landlord is to increase rent into the new rates in exclusion of taxes. That is the value added tax that is chargeable. This position on payment of VAT outside the rent payable has not been contested by the Tenants. They were only heard to ask that their improvements of the respective spaces,their payment of land rates and rents also be considered in our determination.






30.
Having taken all materials placed before this court into account, we shall uphold the      Landlord’s notices to alter the terms of the tenancies herein to the following effect;-
(i)
The Rent payable by M/S Diastar Autocare Centre, the Tenant in BPRT original case no. 826 of 2019 shall be Kshs 180,000/= per month exclusive of VAT
(ii)
The Rent payable by M/S Paramjit Singh T/A Appar Tech Ltd, the Tenant in BPRT original case no. 827 of 2019 shall be Kshs 180,000/= per month exclusive of VAT
(iii)
The Rent payable by M/S Gurmukh Singh T/A Nasib Industrial Supplies Ltd & Glory Paints,Nairobi the Tenant in the lead case no. 828 of 2019 shall be Kshs 280,000/= per month exclusive of VAT; and
iv)
The Rent payable by M/S Paramjit Singh T/A VishKarma Industries Ltd, the Tenant in BPRT original case no.829 of 2019 shall be Kshs 260,000/= per month exclusive of VAT








Issue No. B- When should the rent increment take effect if allowed


31.
The Court of Appeal, the High Court and now the Environment and Land Court have at different occasions and times addressed themselves on this question. Justice Shah in the case of Tala Investments Ltd Supra held as follows;-
“
The ratio decidendi of all the appeals is that the normal order for effective date would be that the date specified in the tenancy notice would be proper but the Tribunal has in proper circumstances discretion to alter the effective date and that such discretion must be exercised Judicially”






32.
On the other hand, in Nakuru ELC Civil Appeal No. 68 of 2016 Supa Duka Nakuru Ltd - vs- Baringo United Co. Ltd, Justice Sila Munyao held as follows;-
“
In my view, the reasons why the Tribunal was of the opinion that the rent needed to be backdated ought to have been given and failure to do that was an error on the part of the Tribunal”


21
“I hold the view that a cautious approach is needed before an order for back pay on rent is made, for the simple reason that this is a cost that was never budgeted for by the Tenant and was never taken into account by the Tenant when operating his business. It can be a huge burden which can lead to the crippling of one’s business especially because it now has to be paid in one lumpsum, covering a significant span of years”






25
“There need to be justifiable reason as to why rent should be back paid which was not given in this case. Both cited decisions leave the Tribunal with the discretion to determine when the assessed new rent ought to commence being paid. The only requirement is that the discretion must be exercised judicially and justification for the discretion given”








33.
In this matter, we appreciate that the duration before there has been any rent increment has been pro-longed.This is mainly from the long delayed conclusion of this case as explained.






34.
From that reality, it is obvious that the Landlord has suffered loss of income and profit. On the other hand, if the determined rent is backdated to the 1/10/2019, it would be devastating to the tenants business and general commerce. In balancing the scales of justice therefore, we would direct that the new rents be payable effective the 1/1/2024.








Issue No C- Who should bear the Costs of suit


33.
On costs, we are guided by the provisions of Section 27(1) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 (Cap 27)and the decision in Tasbir Singh Rai & 3 others -vs- Tarlochan Singh
 Rai & 4 others SC Petition No 4 of 2012
; (2014) CKLR where the Supreme Court held that costs follow the event and that the court has discretion in awarding such costs.






33.
We do not have any reason to depart from that conventional wisdom and we award costs to the Landlord.






33.
In the final analysis, we make the following orders;-
1.
That the notices to alter the terms of the Tenancies herein which are all dated 30/7/2019 are upheld
2.
That the new rent payable on the respective premises to be effective the 1st of January, 2024.
3.
That the Landlord is awarded costs at Kshs 100,000/= to be shared equally among the Tenants




Those are the orders of the court.

Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellant was sued by the 1
st
 respondent for amongst others, general damages for personal injury, pain and suffering and loss of amenities, loss of consortium together with interest thereon at 12% p.a.; special damages of Kshs. 85,000 with interest thereon at 12%p.a. from date of filing suit till payment in full; damages for loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity; costs of future medical attention as well as costs of the suit.






2.
The 1
st
 respondent’s case was that on or about the 8th May 2017 at around 4.30pm along Katito –Kendu Bay road, the 1
st
 respondent who was a lawful fare paying passenger aboard motor vehicle registration number KCE 764U and at Urudi area, the appellant’s driver/agent drove, managed and/or controlled motor vehicle registration number KBX 428X Toyota saloon (premio) causing it to veer off and or make a sudden turn onto the path of the Nissan matatu of which the 1
st
 respondent was aboard resulting in the accident and injuries sustained by the respondent.






3.
In response, the appellant filed a statement of defence dated 15
th
 June 2020 in which he denied all the particulars in the plaint save for the descriptive parts of the plaint being paragraphs 
1
 and 
2
.






4.
The appellant subsequently filed an application dated 20.1.2022 seeking to introduce a third party, the 2
nd
 respondent herein, which application was not opposed and was allowed on the 23.2.2022. The 2
nd
 respondent however neither entered appearance nor filed any defence.






5.
The trial magistrate apportioned liability in the ratio 70:30 in favour of the 1
st
 respondent against the appellant and further awarded the special damages which were not disputed. The trial court proceeded and awarded general damages of Kshs. 5,000,000; Kshs. 1,800,000 damages for loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity; a total of Kshs. 6,320,000 for costs of future medical attention care and expenses; special damages of Kshs. 85,000 as well as costs of the suit.






6.
Aggrieved by the trial court’s judgement, the appellant filed his appeal dated 2
nd
 June 2023 in which he raised the following grounds of appeal:
a.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in treating the evidence and submissions on liability before her superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
b.
The learned trial magistrate did not in the alternative consider or sufficiently consider the demand for contributory negligence based on evidence adduced and the submissions filed by the appellant.
c.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in treating the evidence and submissions on quantum before him superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
d.
The learned trial magistrate misdirected himself in ignoring the principles applicable and the relevant authorities cited in the written submissions presented and filed by the appellant.
e.
The learned trial magistrate erred in not sufficiently taking into account all the evidence presented before her in totality and in particular the evidence presented on behalf of the appellant.
f.
The learned trial magistrate erred in failing to hold that the respondent had failed to prove negligence on the part of the appellant while the onus of proof lay with the respondent.
g.
The learned trial magistrate proceeded on wrong principles (if any) when assessing the damages to be awarded to be awarded to the respondent and failed to apply precedents and tenets of law applicable.
h.
The learned trial magistrate erred in awarding a sum in respect of damages which was so inordinately high in the circumstance that it represented an entirely erroneous estimate vis-à-vis the respondent’s claim.
i.
The learned trial magistrate failed to apply judicially and to adequately evaluate the evidence and exhibits tendered and thereby arrived at a decision unsustainable in law.






7.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The respondents have not filed any submissions on record. I will however consider the 1
st
 respondent’s submissions before the trial court.








The Appellant’s Submissions


8.
The appellant submitted that as a condition of stay pending appeal, through his insurance company, he paid Kshs. 3 million to the 1st respondent over the judgement by the trial court.






9.
It was submitted by the appellant that the court erred in its judgement by stating that the impact was on the left side of the appellant’s vehicle, a fact which was not true as all the witnesses confirmed that the impact was on the right side of the appellant’s vehicle while on the left side of the 3rd party’s vehicle.






10.
The appellant further submitted that his driver was not charged for any traffic offence and thus it was strange for the court to find the appellant 70% liable. It was further submitted that the trial court never considered that there was evidence that had been placed before the court in line with the 3rd party subject vehicle that hit that of the appellant as it was just about to take a right turn; that the 3rd party vehicle was coming from behind the appellant’s vehicle and at a high speed, a fact the court failed to consider.






11.
The appellant thus submitted that taking all the aforementioned into consideration, it was evident that the trial court erred in apportioning liability and that the same ought to be varied.






12.
On general damages, it was submitted that the award of Kshs. 5,000,000 was baseless as there was no support thereof by the 1st respondent and that an award of Kshs. 1,000,000 as proposed by him would be sufficient. Reliance was placed on the case of Siaya Civil Appeal No. 39 of 2019 Pitalis Opiyo Ager v Daniel Otieno Owino & Another where the court noted that “in support of the said fractures and serious injuries the 1st respondent produced various medical reports which the court will note that none of the reports were supported by any XRAY REPORT or XRAY FILMS.”






13.
It was submitted that the trial court erred in its award of loss of earnings and future medical attention which items though mentioned in the plaint, no figures were attached to the same but rather the court picked the same from the 1st respondent’s submissions. The appellant submitted that prayers under the head of future medical expenses must be specifically pleaded and proved as they are regarded as special damages that can only be awarded once pleaded and proved to the standards of law as was held by the Court of Appeal in the case of Tracom Limited & Another v Hassan Mohamed Adan [2009] eKLR a case quoted in 
Ongata Works Ltd v Mwangi (Civil Appeal E046 of 2021
) [2024] KEHC 5738 (KLR) (9 May 2024) (Judgement).






14.
The appellant submitted that he did not oppose the award of special damages. The appellant thus submitted that the trial court ought to have made its judgement as follows, based on the evidence on record:
Liability
1st respondent – 40%
Appellant – 10%
2nd respondent – 50%
General Damages - Kshs. 1,000,000 (To be distributed as above)
Special Damages – Kshs. 85,000
Future Medical Expenses - NIL
The 1
st
 Respondent’s Submissions before the trial court






15.
On liability, the 1
st
 respondent submitted that based on the evidence adduced the same ought to be apportioned in the ratio of 70:30 in relation to the appellant against the 2
nd
 respondent herein who was the 3
rd
 party before the trial court.






16.
On quantum, the 1
st
 respondent submitted for a total sum of Kshs. 20,000,000 as the same had been pleaded and proven through the provision of medical records.






17.
The 1
st
 respondent submitted that the special damages of Kshs. 85,000 had been pleaded and proven by the production of receipts and that the same ought to be applied.








Analysis and Determination


18.
This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and make its own conclusions. It must, however, bear in mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand. In Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR, the court stated as follows-
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






19.
In that regard, an appellate court will only interfere with the judgment of the lower court, if the said decision is founded on wrong legal principles. That was the holding of the Court of Appeal in Mkube v Nyamuro [1983] LLR at 403, where Kneller JA & Hancox Ag JJA held that-
“
A Court on appeal will not normally interfere with the finding of fact by a trial court unless it is based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the judge is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching his conclusion.”






20.
Having considered the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal and the parties’ Written Submissions, it appears to this court that the issues that had been placed before it for its determination: -
a.
Whether or not the apportionment of liability was fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
b.
Whether or not the award of quantum was unjustified in the circumstances of this case so as to warrant interference by this court.






21.
The above issues are resolved below.








Liability


22.
On liability, in Khambi and Another v Mahithi and Another [1968] EA 70, it was held that:
“
It is well settled that where a trial Judge has apportioned liability according to the fault of the parties his apportionment should not be interfered with on appeal, save in exceptional cases, as where there is some error in principle or the apportionment is manifestly erroneous, and an appellate court will not consider itself free to substitute its own apportionment for that made by the trial Judge.”






23.
That was the position in Isabella Wanjiru Karangu v Washington Malele Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1981 [1983] KLR 142 and Mahendra M Malde v George M Angira Civil Appeal No. 12 of 1981, where it was held that apportionment of blame represents an exercise of a discretion with which the appellate court will interfere only when it is clearly wrong, or based on no evidence or on the application of a wrong principle.






24.
The law is clear that he who alleges must proof. The question therefore is whether the 1
st
 respondent herein discharged the burden of proof that the appellant was liable in negligence for the occurrence of the accident wherein he was allegedly injured.






25.
I also note that the appellant introduced a third party, the 2
nd
 respondent herein, whom he blamed for causing the accident.






26.
The evidence adduced by the parties was as follows: The 1
st
 respondent testified as PW1. He adopted his statement dated 23rd February 2020. It was his testimony that he was a lawful passenger aboard a matatu and that he had his seat belt on. He testified that whilst in the vehicle, he saw from the corner of his eye the appellant’s vehicle which was so negligently managed and/or controlled that it veered onto the matatu in which the 1
st
 respondent was aboard and resulting in the accident that caused the 1
st
 respondent’s injuries. It was his testimony that he used to be a mason and watchman but was currently incapacitated. The 1
st
 respondent reiterated his testimony in cross-examination and subsequently closed his case.






27.
The appellant testified as DW1 and adopted his statement filed on the 9.5.2022 as his evidence in chief. It was his testimony that he had lend his car, registration number KBY 428X, to one Duncan Muga on the material date who called him and informed him that he had been involved in an accident at Katito where people had been injured. The appellant blamed the driver of the matatu for the accident.






28.
DW2, Duncan Muga, testified that he was driving the appellant’s vehicle on the material date, that as he was hungry, he saw a shop on his right and indicated that he was turning to the right and that a matatu was approaching at high speed and as he turned, he had an impact on his right bumper. It was his testimony that the approaching matatu could not control its speed and that it rolled several times.






29.
In cross-examination, DW2 testified that he noticed the matatu from behind on his side mirror and that it chipped his right bumper. He testified that he was aware that on turning, one should slow down, however, when he was shown the pictures of the impact on the matatu, he noted that it was on the matatu’s left front corner. In re-examination, he testified that the impact on the two cars was quite minimal and that the bigger impact/damage occurred because of it rolling severally.






30.
I have considered the evidence adduced before the trial court. The parties have given quite varied accounts as to how the accident occurred. How should the court resolve such tension between the account rendered by the Appellant and 1
st
 Respondent on liability?






31.
The established judicial method, which rests on the singular dependability of the fact-base, and which vindicates the principles of fairness, objectivity and legitimacy – is to entertain the account from the other side; and thereafter, to weigh, check and balance the two streams of evidence, thereby arriving at a valid and just result.






32.
The 1st respondent was firm in his testimony. He testified that he was a lawful passenger in a matatu and had even worn his seat belt, a fact that was not controverted by the appellant. He further testified that he saw the appellant’s car veer of its side of the road and end up colliding with the matatu he had boarded.






33.
Juxtaposed against this was the evidence presented in support of the appellant’s case. Firstly, the appellant did not witness the incident. DW2 who was driving the said vehicle testified that he was turning to the right to enter a shop when a speeding matatu hit him and rolled. He admitted that he had seen the matatu in his side mirror and that it was speeding. He told the court that there was significant damage on the matatu’s right where it had collided with him however when shown photographs of the same in cross-examination, he admitted that the matatu’s point of impact was on the left front corner.






34.
Taking all the aforementioned into consideration, it is my view that liability cannot be apportioned against the 1st respondent who was a lawful passenger in motor vehicle registration number KCE 764U and had no control over how the accident said motor vehicle was being driven. There was in essence no basis at all for finding the 1
st
 respondent contributorily negligent.






35.
On the other hand, the driver of the appellant’s vehicle testified that he had seen the matatu approaching him speedily as he had indicated to turn. There is no reason why the appellant’s driver failed to stop and allow the matatu to pass having assessed that it was being driven speedily. The appellant’s driver simply failed to take due care while on the road.






36.
Similarly, there was no reason why the 2nd respondent’s agent, the driver of the matatu failed to slow down having seen the car in front of it had indicated that it was turning to the right.






37.
In this case, I find that liability can only attach to the appellant and 2nd respondent to the exclusion of the 1st respondent.






38.
I thus set aside the trial court’s apportionment of liability and proceed to apportion liability equally between the appellant and the 2
nd
 respondent.








Quantum


39.
The appellant submitted that the award on quantum of damages was inordinately high considering the injuries sustained by the respondent and past comparable awards and that this court ought to reduce the same to Kshs. 1,000,000. The appellant further submitted that the award for loss of earnings & earning capacity as well as future medical expenses ought to be set aside as the same were not specifically pleaded and proven as required by law.






40.
In in Butt v Khan [1982-88] KAR 1 it was held -
“
An appellate court will not disturb an award for damages unless it is inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate. It must be shown that the judge proceeded on wrong principles, or that he misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low”.






41.
I have considered the submissions tendered together with the authorities cited by the parties.








General Damages


42.
General damages are damages at large whose purpose is to compensate the injured to the extent that such injury can be assuaged by a money award. It has repeatedly been stated that money cannot renew a physical frame that has been injured and crushed hence the courts can only award sums which must be viewed as giving reasonable compensation. Awards ought to be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation bearing in mind that the large and inordinate awards may injure the body politic. Furthermore, it is desirable that so far as possible comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards putting into consideration the current prevailing economic circumstances including inflation (see Tayab v Kinanu [1983] KLR 114 and West (H) & Son Ltd v Shephard [1964] AC 326, 345).






43.
The 1
st
 respondent pleaded that he sustained the following injuries:
Paraplegia with a total loss of movement or sensory ability of the waist and lower limbs
Fracture of the left neck of the femur
Fracture of the 6th,7th, 8th and 9th ribs and bilateral pleural effusion
A compression fracture involving the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebral bodies
T11 and T12 compression
Herniation of T11- T12 intervertebral disc with cord compression
Multiple soft tissue injuries on the lower limbs and chest wall






44.
The 1
st
 respondent thus submitted that as a result of the injuries, he would require a wheelchair for mobility. A paraplegic patient’s bed and mattresses and weekly physiotherapy sessions, total loss of erectile function resulting in total inability to perform sexual intercourse and reproductive ability; total loss of bladder and bowel movement control resulting in faecal and urinary incontinence thus requiring constant us of catheter, urinary bags and adult diapers and pressure sores from prolonged immobility.






45.
The said injuries were contained in the P3 form produced by the 1
st
 respondent as well as the discharge summaries and medical report produced by the 1
st
 respondent as exhibits in support of his case and as such the appellant, having not opposed the production of the said documents cannot allege that the same were not proven due to lack of production of x-rays. Furthermore, the trial court that heard and saw the plaintiff /1
st
 respondent in court must have observed the severity of the injuries especially those involving paraplegy as such injuries are too obvious to be hidden from the view of the court.






46.
In the case of Brian Muchiri Waihenya v Jubilee Hauliers Ltd & 2 others [2017] eKLR the Plaintiff suffered severe spinal injury at the neck and a cut wound on his head, had a complete loss of sensation from the chest up to the lower limbs, he was a paraplegic, who would be bed-ridden for life. If he had to get from one place to another, he would have to use a wheel-chair. The court awarded Kshs 8,000,000 damages for Pain & Suffering and Loss of Amenities.






47.
I find that the injuries listed in the authority above are more comparable to those sustained by the 1st respondent herein.






48.
The trial court awarded the 1st respondent Kshs. 5,000,000 for general damages. I find no reason to interfere with the same and thus, I uphold it.








Loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity


49.
The 1
st
 respondent testified before the trial court that as a result of the injuries sustained, he was incapacitated and could not work whereas before the accident, he used to work as a watchman and mason and would earn an average of Kshs. 18,000 per month.






50.
The appellant submitted that the 1st respondent did not prove his claim under this heading which required to be specifically pleaded and proven and that h only provided the figures for this in his submissions.






51.
The trial court awarded the 1st respondent Kshs. 1,800,000 under this heading noting that the 1st respondent never tendered any evidence in support of his claim. The trial court calculated the 1st respondent’s award on the basis of him earning Kshs. 5,000 per month for 30 years.






52.
The Court of Appeal in S J v Francesco Di Nello & another [2015] eKLR while making a distinction between loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity stated that: -
“
Claims under the heads of loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity are distinctively different. Loss of income which may be defined as real or actual loss is loss of future earnings. Loss of earning capacity may be defined as diminution in earning capacity. Loss of income or future earnings is compensated for real assessable loss which is proved by evidence. On the other hand, loss of earning capacity is compensated by an award in general damages, once proved. This was the position enunciated in Fairley v John Thomson Ltd [1973] 2 Llyod’s Law Reports 40 at pg. 14 wherein Lord Denning M.R. said as follows:
“It is important to realize that there is a difference between an award for loss of earnings as distinct from compensation for loss of earning capacity. Compensation for loss of future earnings is awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence. Compensation for diminution in earning capacity is awarded as part of general damages.”
The court proceeded to state that: -
“
The correct position as in the Fairley case (supra) was restated by this court in the case of 
Cecilia Mwangi & Another v Ruth W. Mwangi CA No. 251 of 1996
 as hereunder:
“Loss of earnings is a special damage claim. It must be specifically pleaded and strictly proved. “In the authority of Butler v Butler [1984] KLR 225, the issue of awarding damages for loss of earning capacity was carefully considered and Chesoni Ag. JA (as he then was) said:
“Whilst loss of earning capacity or earning power should be included as an item of general damages, it is not improper to award it under its own heading … Once it is in principle accepted that the victim of personal injuries who has lost his earning capacity is entitled to compensation in the form of damages it is of little materiality whether the award is under the composite head of general damages or as an item on its own, as a loss of earning capacity. At any rate, what is in a name if damages are payable.”






53.
Thus, the claim in respect of lost income is a special damage claim requiring strict proof. Equally, the 1
st
 respondent was obligated to prove the alleged diminished future earning capacity which claim was denied by the appellant. No evidence was led by the 1
st
 respondent in respect of these alleged losses and expenses. Confirmation of the 1st respondent’s incapacitation through the medical report was not enough. He had to prove that he was a mason or watchman and that he was earning the amount claimed or awarded.






54.
The Court of Appeal in the case of Karani v Nchedu (1995-1998)1 EA 87 stated:
“
The claim for loss of earning is a special damage. It must be pleaded and proved. That is the law. The plaintiff gave some evidence in which she said she used to operate a kiosk of some sort at Kasarani, near Nairobi, from which she made Kshs. 50,000/= per month. She produced no documentary evidence to support this claim but even if she had, it would have been of no practical value because the claim was not pleaded. There was really no legal basis for the award and it is accordingly set aside.”






55.
The above decision was in a case where there was an attempt to prove loss of earnings. Here, there was no attempt at all. It was merely pleaded and left to the court to determine the same. Further, it is not clear on what basis the trial court picked the amount of Kshs. 5,000 per month for 30 years as it’s basis for calculating the same. This award was not proper in its entirety and I disallow it.








Costs of Future Medical Attention, Care and Expenses


56.
The issue herein is whether the claim for future medical expenses should have been specifically pleaded and strictly proved. The issue of future medical expenses considered in the case of Tracom Limited & another v Hassan Mohamed Adan [2009] eKLR where the Court of Appeal pronounced stated as follows: -
“
The award for future medical expenses is challenged on two fronts. First, that it was not specifically pleaded and strictly proved. Second, that the multiplier of 25 years was inflated. We readily agree that the claim for future medical expenses is a special claim though within general damages, and needs to be specifically pleaded and proved before a court of law can award it. In the case of Kenya Bus Services Ltd vs. Gituma (2004) 1 EA 91, this Court, stated: -
‘And as regards future medication (physiotherapy), the law is also well established that although an award of damages to meet the cost thereof is made under the rubric of general damages, the need for future medical care is itself special damage and is a fact that must be pleaded if evidence thereon is to be led and the court is to make an award in respect thereof. That follows from the general principle that all losses other than those which the law does contemplate as arising naturally from the infringement of a person’s legal right should be pleaded.’
We understand that to mean that once the plaintiff pleads that there would be need for further medication and hence future medical expenses will be necessary, the plaintiff may not need to specially state what amount it will be as indeed the exact amount of that future expenses will depend on several other matters such as the place where the treatment will be undertaken, and if overseas, the strength of the currency particularly Kenya currency at the time treatment is undertaken and of course the turn that the injury will have taken at the time of the treatment. We think all that will be necessary to plead (if it has to be pleaded at all) is the approximate sum of money that the future medical expenses will require.”






57.
However, the Court of Appeal in 
Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited v AMK (Suing as the mother and next friend of JMK - Minor (Civil Appeal 58 of 2020
) [2021] KECA 52 (KLR) (8 October 2021) (Judgment) in reference to the decision in Tracom Limited & another v Hassan Mohamed Adan (supra) stated as follows:
“
28.
As has been held above, in as much as future medical expenses are in the realm of special damages, it may not be practical for the parties to be able to fully ascertain the exact amount that will be required in the future, it therefore suffices to give an estimate as the respondents did during their testimony.
32.
On the challenge to the award on future medical expenses which the appellant says had not been specifically pleaded and proved, this does not turn on much as the respondent had in their plaint stated that the minor requires additional and medical care. In our view, the functional prosthesis (artificial limbs) and their maintenance costs are covered under that prayer and as held in Tracom Limited & another v Hasssan Mohamed Adan (supra) it was not mandatory for the respondent to delve into detail of the future expenses at that stage thus that ground of appeal fails.”






58.
Similarly, in the case of, 
Forwarding Company Limited & another v Kisilu; Gladwell (Third party) (Civil Appeal 344 of 2018
) [2022] KECA 96 (KLR) (4 February 2022) (Judgment) the Court of Appeal in overturning the decision of this Court declining to award future medical expenses on the ground that the plaintiff had pleaded generally on the same but had failed to attach a specific figure thus lacked specificity, stated as follows: -
“
62.
In the instant case, we do not agree with the finding of the learned judge that failure to plead future medical expenses would fatally affect this specific claim. To demand a specific sum to be proved specifically like special damages would be unreasonable. This is a claim for money not yet spent, for money estimated to be spent depending on how the claimant’s body is responding to treatment, among other things. It is not always clear at the time of filing a case what these future costs may be. The prognosis could change for better or for worse depending on various circumstances.”






59.
Based on the aforementioned decisions which are binding on this court, the argument that the future medical expenses were not specifically pleaded and proved is neither here nor there, it is not a correct argument under the law as was settled in the above cited cases.






60.
In the instant case, the plaintiff stated in the plaint that, he was claiming for costs of future medical expenses and therefore put the defendants on knowledge thereof. The plaintiff, 1
st
 respondent herein, went on to list what he would need including a wheelchair, paraplegic patient’s bed and mattresses, nurse aid, catheter, urinary bags and adult diapers as well as weekly physiotherapy sessions.






61.
Secondly the medical report of Dr Otieno R. Simba supported these claims by the 1
st
 respondent. That report was admitted in evidence and not challenged. It is therefore an undisputed fact that the 1
st
 respondent would require. I find no reason to interfere with the trial court’s award on the same.






62.
As special damages were not disputed, having been pleaded and proved, I find no reason to interfere with the same.






63.
The upshot of the above is that the instant appeal is only partially successful in so far as it apportions liability equally between the appellant and 2
nd
 respondent and further sets aside the award for loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity. The rest of the awards made by the trial court are sustained.






64.
I order that each party bear their own costs of the appeal which is only partially successful.






65.

The plaintiff tendered the supporting affidavit sworn on 26/04/2021 and the further affidavit sworn on 07/2023 together with the attached documents as her evidence in chief. She produced the bundle of annexures as P Exh 1.






10.
On cross-examination, she stated that she was working at Seventh Wonder when she met the defendant. She was a room attendant and storekeeper. Her salary at the time was about Kshs. 5,000/= per month. Her former husband was a balloon pilot. She later learned that most of his money was going to his accounts outside the country. He therefore used to receive only Kshs. 30,000/= to cater for his few expenses as all expenses were catered for by the lodge. When they met, he offered her a job. She was a photographer then. She used to earn from him. She used to pay her expenses from the proceeds of photographing. He had employed her.






11.
She acquired property No. Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/ XXXX before they got married. But they developed it together on the understanding that it was their home and did not belong to only one of them. Her former husband collects rent from two houses. She lived in one and collected rent for one house until recently when he said he would be collecting all the rent.






12.
She is aware of all other properties. She has not provided documentary evidence of her claim in these assets that is Cis Mara Oleleshwa/XXXX,XXXX,XXXX,XXXX and XXXX.






13.
On Cis Mara XXXX, they acquired them jointly and are registered in her name. She made a monetary contribution from her business towards their acquisition. There is a case on these properties where no documents have been provided. The case was a succession case that concluded.






14.
On Cis Mara/Olopito/ XXXX and XXXX, these were her properties. She provided documents of acquisition to the court. These properties were acquired end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019.






15.
On the agreement dated 12/09/2017, the process started in 2017 and concluded in 2019. She was still married to the defendant as the marriage was from 2012 to 2019.

17.
He gave her a gift of Kshs. 6,000,000 and it was not a loan.






18.
On Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/11819, 14233, and 15113, she bought them with the anniversary gift money he had given her.






19.
They lived together and provided each other companionship. He did not support her business. He had initially employed her. He used to visit to check the progress on the farm. She used to visit him at Masai Mara where he was working. She had a daughter before marriage. He did not officially adopt her but lived as a family. Sometimes he paid school fees when she asked for it.






20.
She was the source of all properties in Kenya. He invested through her. She was a land broker. They contributed the funds. She was not aware he had a house in Germany before coming to Kenya.






21.
She contributed roughly Kshs. 15,000,000/= towards the acquisition of their properties. The evidence before the court includes bank statements on her account between 05/10/2016 to 06/12/2016.






22.
On reexamination, she stated that at Seventh Wonder she used to earn a basic salary of Kshs. 5,000 but tips to them were more amounting to Kshs. 20,000/=






23.
On property no. 4391 she stated that the same was purchased using her earnings from the hotel, tips, and photos. He was paying her 50% plus salary of Kshs. 12,500. He used to pay her in cash. They used to sell the photos expensively.






24.
On Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/XXXXand XXXX, she stated that he contributed more to these properties. Her contribution was about Kshs. 250,000/=. These properties were registered jointly because they acquired them jointly but his monthly contribution was higher.






25.
Those registered in her name were purchased using her money. She fenced them. There is massive development of the properties.






26.
He was at Maasai Mara but would go to narok as he was preparing for retirement. He found her developing them and could provide him comfort at home.






27.
They separated in 2017.






28.
Her home is one Cis Mara/ Olopito/XXXX and XXXX. Mr. Lemein sold her the properties.






29.
She advised the defendant to buy the property in the UK to buy off his brothers after his mum’s death and keep the house as theirs. He bought it. He gave her a gift of Kshs. 6 million to buy land. The gift was not a loan. She gave him a balance of her gift and sent it to his son.






30.
The joint account was to do joint development as a family but the gift did not go to the joint account as it was personal.








The defendant’s case


31.
The defendant testified that he is a former husband to the plaintiff. He adopted his replying affidavit sworn on 26/05/2021 and the annextures thereto as his evidence in chief.






32.
On cross-examination he stated that parcel no. Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/4391 was bought in 2012 November. He financed its purchase. Kshs. 800,000 was transferred to her account to cater for the building of the property. It was not for the purchase of Cis Mara/Oleleshwa /4391. He could not remember the name of the farm owner. They lived on the said property as husband and wife. Three mansions are built on it. She worked as a waitress. It was her hobby to get tips from photography. It was not really employment. She tried hairdressing and shop for household goods. She engaged in wheat farming but made a loss of Kshs. 240,000/=. She deposited Kshs. 390,000/= while his’ was Kshs. 470,000 to their joint account. He gave her Kshs. 1,300,000/= as capital to her business. He also gave her Kshs. 500,000 to finance her biz. He loaned her Kshs. 6,000,000 on a promise of joint venture. It was not a gift as stated by her. The money was to be invested in land. Some properties were purchased directly by him to the vendor, others through the Kshs. 6 million he provided. They paid through a joint account or directly by him. He was the only one who contributed to the joint account. He also paid Lemein directly. Purchase negotiations were in his absence but he entrusted her to sign the agreement. They selected properties and purchased them. He has never seen a dependants pass.






33.
They offered companionship mutually. Both of them supervised the site and building until October. She was the only one at the farm. He engaged domestic workers.






34.
The agricultural land Morijo (three parcels) are registered in her name. She signed the sale agreements but he supplied the money. He paid the vendor the purchase money directly from his personal account to the vendor. All she dealt with were registered in her name but those he dealt with were registered in their joint names. The Morijo properties were through succession but were done to her name.






35.
She requested that he finance land in a 10-acre parcel of land and sell it at a profit. She was to refund the Kshs. 6 million. He deposited it to her as a wife. The joint account was dormant at that time. He later closed it two years ago. They made a verbal agreement to loan 6 million when she took him to the site. Naftali a minor was present no other witnesses.






36.
Of Lenana property (3 of them) they acquired them together. The properties were bought after separation. They were acquired in September 2017 and 2018. They were together in 2019. She abandoned the matrimonial home twice; on 31/07/2017 for 11 months and returned in June 2018 she moved back to the matrimonial property and lived for 8 months when she left again in February 2018. This was the final separation. Lenana property was purchased before the separation. It was acquired in September 2017. She used Kshs. 6 million to buy the properties.






37.
He inherited the UK home in 2017. She did not advise him to buy off his brothers. He agreed with his brothers at that time they were still married.






38.
On re-examination, he stated that their marriage was terminated in February 2021. The 6 million he gave her was to buy some property and resell at a substantial profit of Kshs. 4 million. The money was not returned to him the plan collapsed but she had bought properties that she would transfer to him. The properties were Cis Mara/Oleleshwa /XXXX,XXXX and XXXX, Cis Mara/Olopito /XXXX and XXXX.






39.
When she returned to the matrimonial home the 2
nd
 time she requested a loan for 6 months which was about 1.3 million. She did not return the money. There were other loans to renovate her narok shop. He financed cumulatively Kshs. 1.8 million for the shop. She never repaid him but instead, purchased and developed properties, especially Olopito ones.






40.
During marriage as married couples they acted in good faith and trust. They made verbal agreements. He worked as a licensed balloon pilot. He was earning Kshs. 200,000 monthly with 2 months of paid leave.






41.
On Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/XXXX, the same was purchased with his money. He owns property in Germany. He owned a home there. He sold it and proceeds were wired to Kenya. About 23 million. He invested the money in high-return investments. He also earns a pension. The money was used to build no. XXXX. The monthly pension was about 2000 dollars monthly.






42.
Dependency pass, he has never depended upon the plaintiff for survival. There were options to apply as a spouse or individual. Immigration status requires 7 years. He had 8 years in his work permit. As a spouse, he needed a marriage for 3 years. He had not attained this requirement. His quest took long and immigration advised him to withdraw his earlier application and apply as a spouse. They asked his spouse to file a dependency pass and she did. He is not financially dependent on her.






43.
They opened a joint account. She deposited Kshs. 300,000- 400,000 or thereabout. He deposited Kshs. 400,000-500,000/=. That was the only deposit she made into the account. All other deposits to the accounts came from him from the bank statement. It amounts to about 8 million.






44.
On Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/4391, the same was registered in her name because she told him that the inclusion of his name in the title before his permanent status would be problematic. He agreed the exact amount towards the purchase and build was about 8 million.






45.
Of Morijo properties, they were registered in her name for the same reason. He contributed 100% towards their purchase. He paid the purchase price directly to the vendor.






46.
Those in their joint names were from his personal friend JG. He sold them to him he asked him to register them in their joint names. They paid from the joint account she contributed Kshs. 300,000.






47.
Of Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/XXXX -XXXX was financed 100% by him.






48.
Oleleshwa and Olopito properties were registered in her name. She purchased using the 6 million. He is therefore entitled to claim them.






49.
The UK property was his inheritance from his mother. The three sons were to divide equally. She also left them money. They agreed that he would buy them off. He bought from his own sources. The plaintiff was not involved. Income from the rented home was used by her during their marriage. When she left he took over and she only received from one rented house a sum of Kshs. 15,000. They agreed she gets income as her source of income at the time. They mutually agreed after separations that she collects rent from one unit.






50.
It was 32 acres of rental land where agricultural investment was to be done. He gave Kshs. 1,000,000 to the project. There was a loss of Kshs. 240,000 but they redirected Kshs. 76,000 to purchase Oleleshwa.

[2016] eKLR, Kakamega Civil Case No. 18 of 2018 LIO v AOO [2020] eKLR, Kilgoris Matrimonial Cause No. XXXX  of 2021 (OS) HNM v FTS [2021] eKLR and section 7 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
.






55.
The plaintiff submitted that only property acquired and/or developed during cohabitation and before separation qualifies to be called matrimonial property. She relied on the Black’s Law Dictionary Ninth Edition, Milimani Civil Suit No. 59 of 2011(OS) JWC v PBW [2015] eKLR, Mombasa Family Division Originating Summons No. XXXX of 2017 AIN v IMM [2019] eKLR, Nairobi Civil Suit No. 25 of 2012 (OS) RWW V EW [ 2019] eKLR, and Nairobi HCCC No. 39 of 2004 (OS) BNM v GMK [2018] eKLR.






56.
The plaintiff submitted that Beckwith has not rebutted the presumption that the gift of Kshs. 6 million to Zubeda was absolute. She relied on section 3(1) of the 
Law of Contract Act
, section 15 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, and Kakamega Civil Case No. XXXX of 2018 LIO v AOO [2010] eKLR.






57.
The plaintiff submitted that the jurisdiction of this court has not been invoked properly to make an inquiry on the question of loan which is a commercial dispute with a different set of laws and rules. The prayer for cancellation and alteration of title deeds for parcels Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/ 14233, 1511, 11819, Cis Mara/Olopito/ 7193, 7194, and 7196 flouts the provisions of Order 21 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Further, the defendant has not provided certified copies of titles for the said parcels. She relied on owners of the Motor Vessel Lilian ‘S’ v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] KLR 1.






58.
The plaintiff submitted that the loan of Kshs. 6 million should not be used to offset Zubeda’s property. She relied on the case of Nairobi Civil Suit No. 51 of 2012(OS) NNN v SNM [2017] eKLR.






59.
The plaintiff submitted that the Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/ 11819, 14233, 15713, Cis Mara/Olopito/7193, 7194, and 7196 were registered solely in Zubeda’s name with no indication of an existing trust. Therefore, the properties belong to Zubeda absolutely. She relied on the case Mombasa Family Division Divorce Cause No. 31 of 2015 EMP v ENM [2020] eKLR, Nairobi Civil Suit No. 51 of 2012(OS) NNN Vs SNM [2017] eKLR and section 14 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
.






60.
The plaintiff submitted that the statement (GVB 17) carried damning information and admitted the statement is prejudicial to the plaintiff as she will have been denied the right to challenge the facts stated therein leading to a violation of her right to a fair trial.






61.
The plaintiff submitted that a report by Adomag Valuers and Associates (GVB24) does not bear a seal of the company and is not signed on all page’s contents thereon cannot be verified until the maker says so.








The defendant’s submissions.


62.
The defendant submitted that Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXX Cis Mara/Illmashariani/ Morijo/ XXXX Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX and XXX constitute matrimonial property. NYK XXXX, 90 Moor Lane, York, United Kingdom is a trust property and does not constitute matrimonial property. That between 3/6/2012 and 22/02/2021 there was a legal and valid marriage between 3/6/2012 and 22/02/2021, there was a legal and valid marriage between the applicant and respondent. The defendant relied on sections 3(1) and 16 of the 
Marriage Act
, section 6 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, and HNM v FTS [2021] eKLR.






63.
The defendant submitted that the property title no. XXXX,90 Moor Lane York, United Kingdom does not form part of the matrimonial property and it falls within the exceptions under section 6(2) of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
. Further, the plaintiff has not provided any evidence of any monetary or non-monetary contribution to its acquisition improvement or development and therefore not entitled to a share thereof. The defendant relied on section 6(2) of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, and Matrimonial Cause No. 6 of 2021) [2022] KEHC 16643(KLR).






64.
The defendant submitted that 6 million together with Kshs. 3,775,000 and 9,775,000 received by the plaintiff from the defendant are not gifts as claimed but matrimonial property. Consequently, any proceeds, investments, or land acquired through the said funds should be declared to form part of matrimonial property. The defendant relied on section 15 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, and the Black’s Law Dictionary.






65.
The defendant submitted that merely because the property is registered in the name of the plaintiff does not mean that the property belonged to her. Furthermore, properties registered in but names did not automatically grant the plaintiff a share of the property. The plaintiff has to prove the extent of her monetary and non-monetary contribution towards the purchase, improvement, or development of the properties registered in her name. The defendant relied on Article 40(1) and (6) of 
the constitution
, sections 26 and 28 of the 
Land Registration Act
, sections 2,9,12, and 14 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, F.S. v E.Z. [2016] eKLR, and Federation of Women Lawyers of Kenya (FIDA) v Attorney General & Another [2018] eKLR.






66.
The defendant submitted that the division of the matrimonial property between the spouses is determined based on the contribution made by each towards its acquisition, improvement, or development. The defendant contends that a significant portion of funds utilized to acquire, develop, and improve all the suit properties was financed from the sale of his house in Germany for (Kshs. 22,317,032.35) his regular salary, and retirement pension (KES 220,000), consultancy income (USD 1,500) and other savings and other investments while working in Maasai Mara narok county. Therefore, he had the means to acquire the said properties. The defendant contends that the plaintiff’s admission that the funds were used to acquire and develop various properties corroborates the defendant’s assertion that the funds were to be used for a land investment. The various properties are listed as Cis Mara/Oleleshwa 14233, 15113, 11819, Cis Mara /Olopito 7193, 7194, and 7196. The defendant relied on Article 45(3) of 
the Constitution
, section 7 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, JOOV MBO; Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA Kenya) & Another (Amicus Curia)( Petition 11 of 2020)[2023] KESC 4(KLR)( Family), P.N.N v Z.W.N.

69.
The defendant submitted that a fair and reasonable assessment of the parties’ respective contributions and beneficial shares in Cis Mara/Oleleshwa /XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 7196 be pegged in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the defendant which is developed and the rest be pegged at a ratio of 95:5 in favour of the defendant.






70.
The defendant submitted that a fair and reasonable assessment of the parties’ respective contributions and beneficial shares in ownership of tile NYK200848, 90 Moor Lane, York, United Kingdom be pegged in the ratio of 100:0 in favour of the defendant.






71.
The defendant submitted that this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute before it. The defendant relied on Article 165(3)(a)(b)(c) and 45(3) of 
the constitution
, section 6(c) and 17 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, and 
Royal Ngao Holdings Limited v N K Brothers Limited & another (civil case 156 of 2019
) [2021] KEHC 275(KLR).






72.
The defendant submitted that the documentation produced by the defendant in court provides the court with sufficient information on the status of and particulars of each of the suit properties. He urged the court to find that they meet the requirements of Rule 6 given the unique circumstances of the defendant. Further urged this court that should it require these documents, the plaintiff be ordered to produce them.






73.
The defendant submitted that the divorce court properly admitted the witness statement (GVB 17) into evidence and it was part of the court record considered in the determination of the divorce cause. Its production and admission by this court are proper and in line with provisions of section 77 of the 
Evidence Act
. The defendant relied on sections 34 and 77 of the 
Evidence Act
.






74.
The defendant submitted that the report (GVB24) falls within the threshold of section 33(b) of the 
Evidence Act
 and the document is duly signed and thus admissible. He urged this court to exercise its discretion to admit them in evidence as the other documents produced by both parties. The defendant relied on sections 33 and 33(b), 35(1) and (2), 170(1) and (2), 67 and 68 of the 
Evidence Act
, section 2 of the 
Land Registration Act
, and section 2 of the 
Survey Act
.








Analysis And Determination.


Relevant and important facts and period


75.
The plaintiff and the defendant were married under the 
Marriage Act
 on 3
rd
 June, 2012. The marriage was dissolved on 21
st
 February 2021.










Issues


76.
From the pleadings and submissions of the parties, the major issues for determination in this cause are: -
i.
Whether the suit property is matrimonial property;
ii.
Whether the Plaintiff made any contribution in the acquisition or improvement or development of the matrimonial properties;
iii.
Division of the matrimonial property?
iv.
Potency or otherwise of the orders prayed for.






77.
But, there are some issues which are of preliminary significance that arose, to wit;
i.
Jurisdiction to hear and determine the acquisition made out of the 6 million shillings herein
ii.
Whether the property acquired using Kshs. 6 million, 9,775,000/= and 3,775,000/= was matrimonial property
iii.
Whether the defendant flouted provisions of Order 21 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
iv.
Whether contested documents GVB 17 and GVB 24 should be admitted as evidence.








Jurisdiction


78.
The plaintiff argued that this court does not have jurisdiction to try issues on gift between spouses. The plaintiff contends that all that property bought using the gift money belongs to Z absolutely. That this court’s jurisdiction has not been invoked properly to inquire the question of loan which is a commercial dispute with a different set of rules and laws.






79.
The defendant contends that this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter. The defendant contends that the plaintiff cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate on the issue of Kshs. 6 million. The defendant argued that the plaintiff seeks to benefit from the jurisdiction of this court by praying that this court finds that the Kshs. 6 million advanced to her by the defendant was a gift that she used to acquire various properties. On the other hand, she seeks this court to oust its jurisdiction on determining ownership of the said gift when the defendant asserts that the money was a loan and thus he has a beneficial interest in the properties acquired therefrom. According to the defendant, the plaintiff contradicts herself.






80.
The Court of Appeal in AKK v PKW [2020] eKLR stated:
It is our considered view that the High Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of parties in relation to any matrimonial property which is contested. However, by virtue of Section 7, the High Court cannot divide matrimonial property between spouses until their divorce or their marriage is otherwise dissolved.






81.
Gifts between spouses are governed by Section 15 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 which provides as follows: -
Gifts between spouses
Where a spouse gives any property to the other spouse as a gift during the subsistence of the marriage, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the property thereafter belongs absolute to the recipient.






82.
On a strict approach, matters of gifts between spouse are matters falling within the province of this court under the 
Matrimonial Property Act
.






83.
The matters raised herein also related to property acquired during marriage and is claimed as matrimonial property; whether the money used to purchase the properties was given by a spouse to the other spouse as a gift, or loan or trust between spouses is part of the issues to be determined by this court.






84.
This court therefore has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties in relation to matrimonial properties contested herein.
Of Property acquired using Kshs. 6 million, 9,775,000/= and 3,775,000/=






85.
Both parties admit there was a transfer of Kshs. 6 million by the defendant to the plaintiff but differ on the purpose. Z says it was a gift given to mark the 4
th
 wedding anniversary. Beckwith maintains it was a loan for a joint venture to purchase property.






86.
The plaintiff contends that it was more of a gift because it was wired on 21/06/2016 and parties got married on 3/6/2012. June is their anniversary month. She stated that, the money was paid to the plaintiff’s sole account. And, there is no loan agreement. According to her, spouses rarely loan each other such substantial amounts of money and expect repayment without putting it down in writing.






87.
The plaintiff contends that all that property bought using this money belongs to Zubeda absolutely. That this court’s jurisdiction has not been invoked properly to inquire the question of loan which is a commercial dispute with a different set of rules and laws.






88.
The plaintiff contends that the ‘loan’ of 6 million should not be offset against Zubeda’s property.






89.
Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/ 11819 registered on 25/08/2017, Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX registered on 19/01/2017, Cis Mara Oleleshwa/XXXX registered on 28/04/2017. Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX purchased for Kshs. 800,000 on 3/9/2018 and registered on 12/03/2019. Cis Mara/Olopito/7194 purchased at Kshs. 900,000 on 3/9/2018 and registered 12/3/XXXX. Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX purchased for Kshs. 1,700,000 on 12/9/2017 and registered 12/03/2019.






90.
She urged that, it is not contested that the period of separation was between 31/07/2017 and June 2019, from February 2019 to date. Zubeda stated that she purchased the above properties from Kshs. 6 million gifts, income from property management/real estate income from printing campaign materials for the 2017 general elections.






91.
She made further arguments. Financial support from her father, Peter Omao, and proceeds from the sale of Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX (concerning 3 Lenana property) income from her shop and money lending business. These properties were later developed using the aforementioned income sources and loan facilities. If parties intended to have property purchased from 6 million the funds would have been channeled through their joint account and not Z’s account. Properties meant to be owned jointly were registered as such.






92.
The defendant contends that during the subsistence of the marriage, he invested in various business ventures or loaned money to the applicant to undertake various investments in total he advanced a total of Kshs. 9.775,000 in cash and through the bank account on diverse dates during the subsistence of marriage. He provided bank statements (GVB14 and 15).






93.
The defendant refutes the plaintiff’s claims that monies loaned or invested through her by the defendant in the course of the marriage were gifts and not matrimonial property. He tabulated the amounts advanced to the plaintiff and particular dates.






94.
The defendant refutes the plaintiff’s claim that the Kshs. 6 million she received from the defendant was given to her as a 4th-anniversary gift.






95.
The defendant contends that the plaintiff did not provide any written document to show that indeed the money was given to her as a gift or any independent witness to corroborate her claim.






96.
The defendant asserts that the money was a loan to the plaintiff to invest in a property in Narok and repay the principal amount after making her profit. The defendant tabulated the purpose of transfers made when giving instructions to his bank. According to his tabulation, a transfer of 6 million was made to the plaintiff with the intent of land investment. This is evidenced in ‘GVB14’ in the defendant’s handwriting.






97.
The defendant contends that the plaintiff’s admission that the funds were used to acquire and develop various properties corroborates the defendant’s assertion that the funds were to be used for a land investment.






98.
On the basis of evidence, this court finds that, it is not disputed that the money was provided by the defendant through a transfer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not prove the 6million shillings was a gift to her. Evidence show that the money was transferred to her for purposes of land investment. Acquisitions using the said money was also during their marriage, making them matrimonial property.






99.
Other evidence led shows that that Property acquired using Kshs. 9,775,000/=, and 3,775,000/= forms part of the matrimonial property.






100.
In sum, this court finds that Property acquired using Kshs. 6 million, 9,775,000/=, and 3,775,000/= forms part of the matrimonial property.






Provisions of Order 21 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules.


101.
The defendant in his evidence and testimony stated that the plaintiff took possession of all the documents relating to the suit properties. The defendant sought orders of this court to compel the plaintiff to deposit all the title documents relating to the suit properties before this court. The defendant tried and supplied the court with a) title register of the UK property (GVB 18), b) official search records (GVB 16), c) official search records in the valuation report (GVB 24), and d) title deeds relating to Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX and XXXX. in the valuation report (GVB 24).






102.
The court notes that the plaintiff is aware of the particular properties in issue in these proceedings. She is also aware, and filed responses and arguments in respect of properties of whose title deeds she is in possession. The plaintiff despite having possession of title deeds to the properties has not produced them in court. The plaintiff has also not challenged the description or particulars of any of the suit properties as per documents produced by the defendant.






103.
The plaintiff now seeks the aid of the law; and invokes Order 21 rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides: -
Judgment affecting registered title to land [Order 21, rule 6]
Where there is a prayer for a judgment the grant of which would result in some alteration to the title of land registered under any written law concerning the registration of title to land, a certified copy of the title shall be produced to the court before any such judgment is delivered.






104.
It is contrived to seek the aid of the law which you have violated, and without seeking to purge the default by compliance.






105.
In the spirit of article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
, the unique circumstances of the case, and on the basis of the documents filed, Order 21 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules has not been violated.








Contested documents GVB 17 and GVB 24 should be admitted as evidence.


106.
The plaintiff contested that the production and admission of GVB 17 and GVB 24. GVB 17 is a statement of JMM dated 23/09/2020. JG was a plaintiff witness (PW2) in Geoffrey VB v ZWO, Narok Chief Magistrate Divorce Cause No. 12 Of 2019.






107.
The defendant contends that the presence of the witness could not be obtained on time and as such he was not available to testify in the present case. Further, the present case is between two parties to the divorce cause which is dealing substantially the same issue related to their marriage and matrimonial properties. The plaintiff participated in the divorce cause by filing a cross-petition but declined to testify, call witnesses, or cross-examine any of the petitioner’s witnesses despite having reasonable opportunities to do so. Therefore, there is no prejudice suffered by the inclusion of the statement as it is a court record of a divorce case that has been heard and finally determined.






108.
GVB24 is a report drawn by Adomag valuers and associates. The plaintiff contested specifically the limiting conditions 1,8 and 11 of GVB 24 headed’ limiting conditions’ and has not been signed on all pages.






109.
The defendant contends that the report was commissioned and paid for as a professional service from Adomag valuers and associates. Due to time and scheduling constraints, the valuer could not be reached to attend the court session. Page 3 of the report confirms the instructions given and notes that the valuer inspected the properties and valued them based on their open market values between 2014 and 2023. Page 5 of the report outlines the methodology used to conduct the valuation. A letter confirming instructions is dated 12/05/2023 and a payment voucher dated 22/05/2023 for Kshs. 240,000 are included on pages 229 and 230 of the defendant’s bundle of documents. The report itself is authored and signed by a licensed valuer, Dominic O Auma practicing in the firm of Adomag Valuers and Associates as part of the discharge of his professional duty to his client, the defendant.






110.
The report is signed by Dominic O Auma on behalf of Adomag valuers and associates on page 7 thereof. At the footer of each page of the report is the name ‘Adomag valuers and associates’ which is the signature of the valuer and his firm and falls within the definition of a signature as defined in section 2 of the 
Survey Act
 and section 2 of the 
land registration act
 which are among the various legislations which were amended by the Business Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020. From the definition, it is immaterial whether Dominic O Auma used an advanced signature, made a mark, or wrote initials on his name for the document to be deemed signed. What is important is that writing the name of his firm’ Adomag valuers and Associates’ on all pages of the report which he has created by himself is enough to identify him as the signatory and link him to the contents of all pages of the report. There is no evidence that any pages of the documents have been omitted or substituted with others as the report was published in a single process and shared as a scanned PDF document.






111.
The defendant contends that the witness statement (GVB17) and valuation report are both relevant to the case and the contents at reliable as they speak to the facts in issue.






112.
The defendant stated that the documents have been developed by persons who have no pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case. Despite not being available to testify, in open court, each one of them in making the documents relied on information that they had first-hand experience in and personal knowledge of.






113.
John Gatua interacted with the parties to this suit at various times during the marriage while Dominic O Auma the valuer rendered his professional expertise by inspecting each of the properties and rendering his opinion on their respective values. The defendant therefore called upon this court to make a presumption that they are genuine in the development of the documents as no compelling evidence has been adduced to contradict their statements.






114.
The defendant further contends that counsel for the parties agreed during pre-trial mentions to have all the documents including certified copies produced by the parties filed comprehensive statements and attached all relevant documentation with leave of the court.






115.
The defendant contends that the plaintiff has not challenged the admissibility of all other documents (agreements, certificates, bank statements, or records) produced by the defendant despite not being produced by their makers or insisted on their makers to be cross-examined on the substance of the documents expunging the documents would be prejudicial and occasion injustice. The court is capable of weighing and determining the probative value and relevance of any evidence presented for its consideration.






116.
This court finds that the statement (GVB 17) is part of a court record in the divorce cause which was heard and determined therefore the plaintiff stands to suffer no prejudice by the inclusion of the statement as evidence in this matter.






117.
This court finds that the report (GVB 24) falls within the threshold of section 33(b) of the 
Evidence Act
. The document is also duly signed.






118.
Accordingly, the statement (GVB17) and report (GVB 24) are admitted as part of the evidence of the defendant herein






119.
This court will delve into each of the individual properties.








Of Matrimonial property: the law


120.
Matrimonial property includes; _
“
(a)
the matrimonial home or homes
(b)
Household goods and effects in the matrimonial home or houses or
(c)
Any other immovable and movable property jointly owned and acquired during the subsistence of the marriage."" (S. 6, 
Matrimonial Property Act
)
117)
The plaintiff has listed the following properties as comprising matrimonial properties: -
a)
Illmashariani/Morijo/ XXXX
b)
Illmashariani/Morijo/ XXXX
c)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
d)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
e)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
f)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
g)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
h)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
i)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
j)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
k)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
l)
Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX
m)
Cismara/Oleleshwa (number withheld by the defendant)






121.
The defendant has admitted the above properties are matrimonial property, save he added Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX,XXXX and XXXX to comprise matrimonial properties.






122.
Section 14 of the Matrimonial Properties Act has created two rebuttable presumptions of law in respect of property acquired during marriage as follows:
14. Presumptions as to property acquired during marriage
Where matrimonial property is acquired during marriage-
a.
in the name of one spouse, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the property is held in trust for the other spouse; and
b.
in the names of the spouses jointly, there shall be rebuttable presumption that their beneficial interests in the matrimonial property are equal






123.
Subject to the foregoing presumptions of law, the rule of thumb is; Whoever alleges must prove the proportion of ownership of the matrimonial property.






124.
Matrimonial property rights are real property rights protected under Article 40 of 
the Constitution
. The broad constitutional principle that underpins rights at, during, and upon dissolution of a marriage including matrimonial property rights is found in article 45(3) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010 which states that;
“
Parties to a marriage are entitled to equal rights at the time of marriage, during the marriage, and at the dissolution of marriage.""






125.
Nonetheless, judicial pronouncements posit that this constitutional provision is not a peremptory command of a 50/50 ownership of matrimonial property between the spouses. See the case of PNN v ZWN (2017) eKLR, Kiage JA; expressed himself on this issue as follows:
“
I think that it would be surreal to suppose that 
the Constitution
 somehow converts the state of coverture into some sort of laissez-passer, a passport to fifty percent wealth regardless of what one does in that marriage. I cannot think of a more pernicious doctrine designed to convert otherwise honest people into gold-digging, sponsor-seeking, pleasure-loving, and divorce-hoping brides and, alas, grooms. Industry, economy, effort, frugality, investment, and all those principles that lead spouses to work together to improve the family fortunes stand in peril of abandonment were we to say 
the Constitution
 gives automatic half-share to a spouse whether or not he or she earns it. I do not think that getting married gives a spouse a free cash cheque bearing the words “50 percent.”






126.
Ownership of matrimonial property vests by the contribution of the spouse towards the acquisition or development or improvement of the property. See 
Matrimonial Property Act
 which provides in Section 7 that;
“
Subject to section 6(3), ownership of property vests in the spouses according to the contribution of either spouse towards its acquisition and shall be divided between the spouses if they divorce or their marriage is otherwise dissolved.""






127.
Of beneficial ownership arising out of the development or improvement of property by a spouse, see Section 9 of the Act which provides as follows: -
“
Where one spouse acquires property before or during the marriage and the property acquired during the marriage does not become matrimonial property, but the other spouse makes a contribution towards the improvement of the property, the spouse who makes a contribution acquires a beneficial interest in property equal to the contribution made.”






128.
Accordingly, the contribution of the spouse towards the acquisition or development of the matrimonial property determines the extent of ownership. So, will spouses own matrimonial property in proportions equal to their contribution; which may be in equal shares or other proportions. Mutatis mutandis, the division of the matrimonial property between the spouses is in accordance with the contribution made by each towards its acquisition or improvement or development.






129.
Contribution by a spouse for purposes of ownership and division of matrimonial property may be monetary or non-monetary or both. According to section 2 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
: -
“
contribution” means monetary and non-monetary contribution and includes—
(a)
domestic work and management of the matrimonial home;
(b)
child care;
(c)
companionship;
(d)
management of family business or property; and
(e)
farm work;






130.
In this case, the plaintiff claims her contribution to the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial properties in question was monetary as well as non-monetary.






131.
The court must give effect to both monetary and non-monetary contributions made by the applicant and the Respondent during the currency of the marriage in the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial property. See the case of NWM v KNM [2014] eKLR.






132.
Applying the test:








CIS Mara/Oleleshwa/4391


133.
It is not disputed that the parties established their matrimonial home, and settled as husband and wife on Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/4391.






134.
The plaintiff contends that the parties had household items in the matrimonial home erected on Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX and upon separation Beckwith retained them.






135.
The point of disagreement is the acquisition and development of the property.






136.
The plaintiff claimed that she acquired the property before marriage at Kshs. 7 million from her own savings. She claimed further that, the property was thereafter developed by the parties' joint efforts from funds pooled in their joint account. The initial savings came from Z income generated from a) salary and tips working at Seventh Wonder in Maasai Mara and b) commissions from photography work done for Beckwith before marriage.






137.
The sale agreement was executed by Zubeda as the sole purchaser from Sammy Maina Kigotho on 14/11/2012. That Beckwith’s initial amount paid into the joint account was made on 27/06/2013 way after Z had concluded the purchase.






138.
The defendant contends that he made a significant monetary contribution of Kshs. 7,196,149(94.87%) towards the construction of Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX on diverse dates between 2013 and 2014 as per bank statements (GVB 11). The same coincides with the time the property was acquired and developed.






139.
Notably, the plaintiff claims that she bought this property before marriage in November, 2012. However, the evidence shows that the two were married on 3
rd
 June, 2012.






140.
The plaintiff also stated that the property was developed through their joint efforts; using funds from their joint account.






141.
Nevertheless, the plaintiff has not disputed that the defendant made a monetary contribution to the acquisition, development, and improvement of this property. She however claims she made a monetary contribution of Kshs. 7 million. The property was acquired for Kshs 700, 000/= as per the defendant’s testimony which proceeds from the Kshs. 1 million invested in the failed wheat project (GVB 7). The estimates of the value of the properties based on the valuation report (GVB 24) match the amounts spent by the defendant to acquire, develop, and improve the property.






142.
No evidence was adduced before the court by the plaintiff that she paid for the said property save for the sale agreement. The plaintiff was working earning Kshs. 12,500/= monthly and could not possibly access that kind of money or means to make payments but for the defendant’s intervention who was earning significant income.






143.
That the plaintiff has not produced evidence of the non-monetary contribution. She was compensated as he gave her Kshs. 39,000/= monthly to run the matrimonial home (GVB21). The defendant paid house help Kshs. 8,109.90 set for cleaners (GVB22). HOUSE servants Kshs. 9,370.30 set for cooks. He therefore provided equivalent if not greater non-monetary contribution. He bought up the plaintiff’s daughter (GVB 20). The evidence shao that, the plaintiff frustrated his efforts to obtain a residency permit in March 2019(GVB 10). The purported role in obtaining status was not attributed to the acquisition of the matrimonial property.






144.
The defendant was present at all material times of the acquisition, development, and improvement of the property while working at Maasai Mara. Since the construction he had lived in the matrimonial home from retirement and continued to oversee the necessary repairs and maintenance etc.






145.
As regards household goods, the defendant disputes the claim and asserts that she carted away all household goods from the matrimonial home when she vacated and transferred them to Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX. The defendant was forced to acquire new household goods which are now his sole property.






146.
This court finds that this property was acquired and developed during the subsistence of marriage.






147.
The defendant proposes a 95:5 sharing of the above matrimonial property.






148.
The evidence show that the defendant made substantial contribution towards the purchase and development of the property. However, there is some evidence that the plaintiff made some contribution to the development of the property as she earning a salary and tips working at Seventh Wonder in Maasai Mara, and commissions from photography work done for Beckwith before marriage.






149.
They established their matrimonial home on the property and lived there until the plaintiff moved out.






150.
Because of these reasons, this court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to a 50% share of parcel No. Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/XXXX. It is so ordered.








Title No. 90 Moor Lane, XXXX, (freehold).


151.
The plaintiff does not dispute that Beckwith inherited this parcel of land. She stated that the same was inherited during the subsistence of marriage and the two considered the same as their overseas home.






152.
This parcel of land was transmitted to the defendant in May 2017 after the demise of his mother and during their cohabitation.






153.
The plaintiff contends that on her advice, Beckwith bought off his brother’s respective shares from funds pooled for the family. The home was utilized as a family home on two occasions the parties traveled to the UK.






154.
The defendant contends that this property is ancestral property inherited under UK customary law by him and his two brothers following the will of his mother upon her demise in 2017. It is not contested that the property was inherited during the subsistence of marriage.






155.
The defendant contends that this property does not form part of the matrimonial property and falls within the exceptions under section 6(2) of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
.






156.
The defendant contends that if this court finds that it is matrimonial property then the plaintiff has not proved monetary or non-monetary contribution to its acquisition improvement or development and therefore not entitled to a share of the property.






157.
The defendant contends that he paid directly from his personal bank account and not pooled resources as claimed by the plaintiff to secure his interest and those of his two sons, who shall inherit the property. He produced a bank statement (GVB 19) that showed transfers to facilitate the conveyance of the properties to his name following the succession. Therefore, the plaintiff could not have contributed to its acquisition, improvement, or development. The deal was brother to brother agreement and her advice was never needed or sought or obtained.






158.
The defendant contends that during the subsistence of marriage, the couple did not live in the UK. The two times they visited the UK were to attend his brother's wedding and the funeral of his mother. During the visits, they did not stay at his mother’s house. They were hosted by his cousin.






159.
This court finds that this property was acquired during the subsistence of marriage. However, other than claiming that she advised the defendant to buy off his brothers and keep the property, the plaintiff has not demonstrated any monetary or non-monetary contribution towards the property in the UK.






160.
This court finds that the plaintiff has not proved contribution in respect of this property.






161.
This court finds that the Defendant is entitled to a 100% of Title No.90 Moor Lane, XXXX(freehold).








CIS Mara/ Oleleshwa /XXXX,XXXX,XXXX,XXXX AND XXXX.


162.
The plaintiff contends that these properties were purchased jointly from their joint account. They were registered in their joint names in the year 2014. According to her, there was a clear intention for joint and equal ownership.






163.
Z claimed that she funded the joint account from income gotten from a) hairdressing, b) selling household goods, c) money-lending business, and d) being a property manager Real estate business.






164.
The defendant contends that he purchased the six properties lying in a 4-acre parcel of land in four installments in July 2014 at a total cost of Kshs. 1,320,000 from his friend John Gatua partly through cash transfer as shown in GVB 13. The balance was paid through credit for materials remaining from deposits left from his hardware store. He argued that the purchase price was not paid from a joint account as alleged by the plaintiff.






165.
Further the estimates of the value of the properties based on the valuation report (GVB 24) match the monetary contribution by the defendant to acquire develop and improve the properties. The defendant emphasized that the registration of the properties in his wife’s name was merely a matter of convenience but the true ownership and equitable interest rest with him due to his direct monetary contribution towards their acquisition. He did so purely for the affection he had for his wife at the material time and in good faith. He has confirmed to provide a non-monetary contribution to the improvement of the properties through supervision and management without any assistance or input from the plaintiff.






166.
The defendant disputes the imputation of a joint venture, ownership, or any non-monetary contribution from the plaintiff.






167.
The defendant evaluated the monetary contribution and non-monetary contribution at 100: 0 in his favour. According to him, she therefore does not acquire any beneficial interest owing to lack of contribution.






168.
This court finds that these properties were acquired and developed during the subsistence of marriage.






169.
Zubeda claimed that she funded the joint account from income gotten from a) hairdressing, b) selling household goods, c) money-lending business, and d) being a property manager Real estate business.






170.
Nevertheless, she did not show the specific amounts in monetary contribution towards acquisition or development of these properties. The defendant stated that the properties were registered as joint ownership in good faith and for the great love and affection he had for his wife at the time.






171.
But, as real property manager, her advice was valuable towards the acquisition of the properties which earns her a proportion of these properties. The joint ownership is also a signification of the intention to confer some proprietary rights upon the plaintiff. The properties were purchased during the subsistence of marriage. Accordingly, it will be most unfair to deny her a share in the properties as proposed by the defendant.






172.
This court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to 10% of these properties.






173.
This court finds that the defendant and the plaintiff is entitled to 90% and 10% share, respectively, of parcel numbers Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa /XXXX,XXXX,XXXX,XXXX It is so ordered.








CIS Mara /Oleleshwa/XXXX,XXXX,XXXX


174.
The plaintiff contends that she purchased these properties using Kshs. 6 million gifted to her. Therefore, they were never intended to be owned jointly.






175.
The defendant contends that he advanced monies to the plaintiff. He submitted various bank statements tracing monies sent to the plaintiff in GVB 14 and 15 totaling Kshs. 9,035,000/=






176.
Of gifts between spouses, Section 15 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 provides as follows: -
Gifts between spouses
Where a spouse gives any property to the other spouse as a gift during the subsistence of the marriage, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the property thereafter belongs absolute to the recipient.






177.
The presumption that a gift belongs absolutely to the recipient is nonetheless, rebuttable presumption. Rebuttable presumption is: -
“
An inference drawn from certain facts that establish a prima facie case, which may be overcome by the introduction of contrary evidence’ (The blacks law dictionary).






178.
The spouse claiming was gifted property must, nonetheless, prove the gift; ‘the voluntary transfer of property to another without compensation’ (The blacks law dictionary).






179.
The plaintiff claims that she was given a sum of Kshs. 6 million as a gift by the defendant during their marriage anniversary in June. She also claims that she used the money gift to buy the properties in question.






180.
The defendant claims the money was given for purposes of investment. The evidence by the defendant shows that the transfer of the said money to the plaintiff was for purposes of investment. The evidence negates any gifting of the money to the plaintiff. This court therefore finds that the plaintiff has not proved the alleged gift. The said sum of money was not a gift as claimed by the plaintiff.






181.
The next hurdles are a twining of; whether the property purchased using the said money was matrimonial property. And, whether the registration of the properties in the name of the plaintiff confer exclusive rights upon the plaintiff or is a trust?






182.
These properties were acquired during the marriage and were registered in the name of the plaintiff. Section 14 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
 tackles this issue by creating rebuttable presumptions of; trust; and equal sharing of joint owned property, as follows: -
Presumptions as to property acquired during marriage
Where matrimonial property is acquired during marriage -
a.
in the name of one spouse, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the property is held in trust for the other spouse; and
b.
in the names of the spouses jointly, there shall be rebuttable presumption that their beneficial interests in the matrimonial property are equal.






183.
The decision in Njoroge v Ngari[1985] KLR, 480, although was made before the 
Matrimonial Property Act
, addressed the rebuttable presumption of trust of matrimonial property being held in the name of one spouse, and even if the property is registered in the name of one spouse, but the other spouse made contribution towards its acquisition, each spouse has proprietary interests in that property.






184.
The trust form- constructive remedial trust- has been used in law to remedy situations where one of the spouses in full control of or in whose name the matrimonial property stands intends to assume or claim absolute ownership of the matrimonial property to the exclusion and detriment of the other spouse.






185.
The evidence before the court shows an undisputed causal link between the idea of the business ventures from the defendant, his agreement to the investment, the transfer of funds to the plaintiff’s account, and the subsequent acquisition of properties that are registered in the name of the plaintiff.






186.
The defendant contends that he made a monetary contribution to the acquisition of the above properties. Therefore, said properties were acquired from monies totaling Kshs. 9,035,000/= given to the plaintiff by the defendant and not gifts; and are matrimonial properties.






187.
The defendant tabulated a total of Kshs. 4,400,000/=. The plaintiff has conceded to receiving Kshs. 6 million which she used to purchase the above properties. She stated that she used the balance from the 6 million and proceeds from the sale of Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX to acquire Cis Mara/Olopito/XXXX,XXXX,XXXX and XXXX.






188.
The defendant contends that there was a restriction on property known as cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX. He is surprised at how the plaintiff sold the same yet the official search (GVB 16) shows that she is still the registered owner. He called upon this court to rescind the sale agreement thereto as the same is matrimonial property held in trust for the benefit of the defendant. He contends the transaction violates section 36 of the 
Land Registration Act
 and section 12 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
. Further, the defendant argued that if monies have been received by the plaintiff she should account for the same. Any proceeds of the funds in the form of investments or properties should form part of the matrimonial property.






189.
These arguments introduce a rather nascent subject of tracing and following trust property to the traceable product of the original trust property.






190.
Tracing is an evidential process by which one asset is permitted to stand in place of another asset for which the claimant claims rights arising from the original asset.






191.
Where the claimant’s asset is used to acquire or is exchanged for another asset (traceable product), the rights in the original asset are transmitted in law to the traceable product, and the traceable product is treated as to be subject to the claimant’s rights in the original asset, and is recoverable as such. This premise is also the basis for recovery of proceeds of crime.






192.
This court finds that these properties are matrimonial property as they were acquired and developed during the subsistence of marriage, thus, trust property under section 14 of the 
Matrimonial Property Act
.






193.
The plaintiff admitted that she used the 6 million shillings provided by the defendant to purchase these properties. She has not proved any gift. She has not also proved any contribution in respect of these properties.






194.
Nevertheless, the defendant has proposed a ratio of 95:5 sharing of the above properties in favour of the defendant.






195.
On that basis, and the fact that she identified the properties and concluded the transactions thereto, this court orders 95:5% sharing of parcel numbers Cis Mara /Oleleshwa/XXXX,XXXX, and XXXX between the defendant and the plaintiff, respectively. On the basis of tracing and following of trust property, sale of Parcel No. Cis Mara/Oleleshwa/XXXX would be in breach of trust and is recoverable by the trust.








CIS MARA/OLOPITO/XXXX,XXXX and XXXX..


196.
The plaintiff contends that these properties she purchased from the balance of 6 million gift and income from a) property management/real estate, b) printing campaign materials for the 2017 elections, and that is how she met the seller d) financial support from his father, PO) proceeds from the sale of Cis Mara /Oleleshwa/XXXX.






197.
She established her separate home having moved out of the shared house sitting on parcel no. Cis Mara/ Oleleshwa/ XXXX. She obtained a loan from Golden Chance Sacco to develop the said property. Beckwith never utilized the same as a family home and only visited when trying to reconcile with Z.






198.
The defendant contends that he advanced monies to the plaintiff. He submitted various bank statements tracing monies sent to the plaintiff in GVB 14 and 15 totaling Kshs. 9,035,000/=






199.
The evidence before the court shows an undisputed causal link between the idea of the business ventures from the defendant, his agreement to the investment, the transfer of funds to the plaintiff’s account, and the subsequent acquisition of properties that are registered in the name of the plaintiff.






200.
The defendant contends that he made a monetary contribution to the acquisition of the above properties. Therefore, the said properties were acquired from monies totaling Kshs. 9,035,000/= advanced to the plaintiff by the defendant and not gifts but are matrimonial properties.






201.
The defendant contends that the plaintiff has not satisfactorily quantified her monetary contribution to the acquisition of these properties or income from her ‘business ventures’. The plaintiff tendered bank statements (ZWO 10)- cooperative bank statements-transactions between 05/10/2016 and 05/11/2016. Narok's golden chance Sacco statements indicate a loan of Kshs. 3,500,000/= between 31/07/2019 and 25/11/2022.






202.
The defendant contends that the transactions reflected in the statement from the cooperative bank for one month only and goes on to confirm that the plaintiff was only liquid after receiving Kshs. 6 million from the defendant. They do not present a true picture of her financial status.






203.
The defendant relied on the testimony of John Gatua (GVB 17) during the divorce cause to show that the plaintiff was engaged in potentially fraudulent activities as the Sacco and as such the statements from the Sacco are potentially forgeries and have little if any probative value. In any event, if at all she obtained a loan, then the same was used to develop matrimonial property and can account for her contribution.






204.
The defendant contends that the practice in Sacco’s, individuals are granted loans based on making a deposit. The defendant posits that the deposit of Kshs. 1.4 million in the statements reflect part of the funds obtained from him. No evidence has been tendered towards the purchase of any of the properties, the plaintiff has admitted that some of the funds were obtained from the defendant proving the defendant's monetary contribution to the acquisition, development, and improvement.






205.
On non-monetary contributions, the defendant contends that he continued to undertake domestic work, child care, companionship, and general house repairs during construction between 2015 and 2019. He continued even after the plaintiff deserted the marriage.






206.
The defendant evaluates the monetary contribution of the defendant as Kshs. 9,035,000/= and the plaintiff as Kshs. 3.5 million equivalents to a ratio of 70:30 in favour of the defendant. The total of both figures equals Kshs 12,535,00 which is not far from the estimated value of Kshs. 11,831,000/= during the period.






207.
The defendant evaluated the non-monetary contribution of both parties at 70: 30 in favour of the defendant.






208.
This court notes that, on the evidence by the plaintiff, these properties were purchased and developed partly using the balance from the 6 million shillings which she claimed was a gift, and sale of Cis Mara /Oleleshwa/XXXX, which also had been purchased using part of the said 6 million. These are matrimonial property.






209.
The plaintiff identified the properties. She has also on a balance of probability proved contribution to this property. She established the matrimonial home here after moving out of the original matrimonial home to which the court has assigned her 50% ownership.






210.
The defendant proposes a 95:5 sharing of the Cis Mara/ Olopito XXXX,XXXX. The defendant proposes a 60:40 in favour of the defendant in respect of Cis Mara/Olopito/ XXXX.






211.
In all fairness, although the defendant made a substantial contribution towards the acquisition and development of these properties, this court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to a 40% share of Cis Mara/ Olopito XXXX,XXXX,XXXX. The defendant is entitled to a 60% share of the said properties.








CIS Mara /Ilmashariani/Morijo/5197, 5484 and 5848


212.
The plaintiff contends that these properties were funded by Beckwith’s account. She scouted for them, facilitated the conveyancing process, fully participated in litigation to secure a clean title, and developed it. She started a farm, and planted 300 trees, now mature for harvest, she put up servant quarters and structures for poultry, rabbits, and other livestock and installed massive water tanks, farming pumps, and pipes. Beckwith is still farming on these parcels and generating income therefrom.






213.
The plaintiff argued that the lion's share of the family’s upkeep was largely shouldered by her while Beckwith was away working at the Maasai Mara. She was responsible for the purchase of household supplies, food clothing furniture, and fittings and payment of all water and electricity bills. She also catered for her child’s food clothing, medical care, and other subsistence not catered for by Beckwith. She also paid legal fees of stamp duty costs involved in doing physical and formal due diligence and searches and general conveyancing expenses. Beckwith only paid the purchase price and did not cater for preliminary and follow-up expenses.






214.
ZWO-7 was an except from her bank’s account statement proof of her income and expenditure towards domestic and business ventures. For instance, lots of payments to Tuskys Oltalet Mall for domestic purchase, Furniture Palace and Gantroniqs for home furniture and electronics, and Maish Boutique for clothes among others. She contends that just because Beckwith deposited over 22 million in his Kenyan bank accounts does not translate to him using the entire sum in the purchase and development of the matrimonial property. She argued that the transactions 12/01/2019, 16/11/209, and 29/01/2019 those monies were utilized by Beckwith for his own needs given that Zubeda had moved out of the shared home.






215.
The plaintiff contends that contrary to Beckwith’s allegation that she did not do domestic work as he hired a house help; no evidence supports that allegation. Further, an African wife does not stop doing domestic chores when a household is employed.






216.
The plaintiff contends that Beckwith relied on the expertise in land matters to scout for prime parcels, negotiate purchase prices, and pursue registration in their favour. She was diligent and secured all titles.






217.
The matrimonial home and rental units attached thereto, the Morijo farm, servants’ quarters, tanks and pipes plus structures for pigs and rabbits were all done under the direct supervision of Z while Beckwith was away working.






218.
The plaintiff was involved directly in pursuing registration of Morijo/5197 and 5481 despite ongoing litigation. She bore litigation costs and related expenses solely. Beckwith came to Kenya on a work permit which was set to expire after retirement but Z supported his application for a dependency pass and he was issued permanent residency. Beckwith was issued permanent residency on 13/05/2016 as a result of the application dated 10/04/2016.






219.
The defendant contends that he fully financed the development and management of both the agricultural properties. He paid a total of Kshs. 4,230,000(100%) directly from his personal bank account between February and May 2015 to one Dickson Lemein as per the annexed bank statement (GVB 12). The dates of payment are contemporaneous with the time the property was acquired, registered, and developed. Further, the estimates of the value of the properties based on the valuation report (GVB 24) match the monetary contribution by the defendant to acquire develop and improve the property. The defendant contends that given his qualifications in agriculture. Since February 2015 single-handedly managed the farm; c and agribusiness including the staff and activities in the farm; caring for chicken, livestock, and rabbits and planting various crops and trees, and procurement of various products and services.






220.
The defendant disputes the claim by the plaintiff of 50% shares based on non-monetary contributions as she had no role in the management of the farm. Further, she has not provided evidence to support her claim.






221.
The defendant contends that there is no dispute in these properties and no evidence has been adduced before the court. The plaintiff’s non-monetary contribution is limited to her work as an agent towards facilitating the acquisition. The defendant does not dispute the same should be pegged at a typical agency fee of 5% of the property value at the time of acquisition which is equivalent to Kshs. 211,500/=






222.
This court finds that this property is a matrimonial property as it was acquired and developed during the subsistence of marriage.






223.
The evidence shows that the defendant made substantial contribution towards the acquisition and development of these properties. The plaintiff, however, did work in identifying the properties, and pursued their conveyance. She also may have contributed in the development of the properties to some proportion. Accordingly, this court finds that the plaintiff on a balance of probability has proved contribution to this property.






224.
Good judgment, based on the evidence, is that, the plaintiff is entitled to a 10% share of Cis Mara/ Ilmashariani/Morijo/XXXX,XXXX and XXXX. The defendant is entitled to a 90% share of the said properties.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
This ruling relates to the petitioner’s notice of motion dated 15
th
 April 2024 which seeks the following orders: -
a.
Leave be granted to amend their petition as per the draft amended petition.
b.
The draft amended petition be deemed as duly filed and served.
c.
Costs of the application be in the cause.






2.
The respondents have opposed the application by filing the Grounds of Opposition dated 26
th
 April 2024 and prayed for the same to be dismissed with costs. The main ground for opposing the application being that the petitioners are introducing a new case. However, the petitioner’s case is that the request to amend the petition is that certain events took place after filing the petition which have a bearing on the fair determination of the petition. Specifically, the applicants aver that they discovered that they had been removed from the respondents’ pay roll contrary to the court orders issued on 24
th
 November, 2023 and therefore they are no longer employees of the respondents.








Submissions


3.
The petitioners submitted that leave to amend their petition should be granted because the respondents will not suffer any prejudice; that the amendment seeks for the remedy of reinstatement and compensation for unfair termination; that the cause of action will not be altered by the amendment nor will it introduce new or inconsistent cause of action; and that the amendment will assist the court arrive at a proper determination of the suit.






4.
For emphasis, reliance was placed on the holding on 
Humanity Action Knowledge Integrity in Africa Trust (Haki Africa) & 19 others v Attorney General & 3 others; Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHCR) & 2 others (Interested Parties) (2020) eKLR, Geyser International Assets Limited v Attorney General & 3 others (2019) eKLR and Institute for Social Accountability & another v Parliament of Kenya & 3 others (2014) eKLR
 where the court held that amendment of pleadings can be done at any time before judgment, to enable the court to determine the real questions in controversy or to avoid multiplicity of suits provided it is done without undue delay or introducing new or inconsistent cause of action.






5.
The respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the discretion whether or not to grant leave to amend pleadings should be exercised judiciously land each case ought to be evaluated independently. Reliance was placed on the case of Kassam v Bank of Baroda (2002) eKLR where the court held that amendment is to be granted where injustice will not be occasioned on the other side, and where it is necessary for the purpose of determining the real issue in controversy between the parties.






6.
It was submitted that intended amendment will not clarify the real issues in controversy between the parties but will introduce new cause of action which is inconsistently with the one in the original petition. Consequently, the court was urged to decline the leave sought. Reliance was placed on the case of John Mulwa Kangaatu v Pan African Insurance (2015) eKLR where the court declined to grant leave to amend pleadings because it was introducing a new cause of action.








Analysis and determination


7.
Having considered the motion, Affidavit, Grounds of Opposition and the rival submissions, the only issue for determination is whether or not leave to amend the petition should be granted as prayed.






8.
Rule 18 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya (Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) Practice and Procedure Rules, 2013 (Mutunga Rules) provide that: -
“
A party who wishes to amend its pleadings at any stage of the proceedings may do so with the leave of the courts.”






9.
In the case of Praxides Musunji Bulemi v The Commissioner of Prisons & 2 others (2020) eKLR, Musyoka J held that: -
“
From the above decisions, it should be clear that the court can, at any stage of the proceedings, allow a party to amend its pleadings, so long as the same will not prejudice the other party. The applicant herein seeks to amend the petition to add a prayer for the remedy of reinstatement. This is a remedy provided for under 
the Constitution
, and is available to the petitioner, upon determination by the court in her favour. The respondent argues that the amendment will raise a fresh cause of action, and that the same would amount to an abuse of court process, considering that the matter pends judgment. I note that the prayer for reinstatement arises from the issues in the petition, which are still intact. The amendment does not, in any way, alter the cause of action as submitted by the respondent.”






10.
In the instant case, the petitioners sued the respondents seeking protection from being removed from the pay roll and to be converted to permanent employees. As at the time they filed the suit, their fixed term contracts had lapsed. They now seek leave to amend the petition to seek reinstatement because they discovered that, despite existence of court orders, they were removed from the respondents’ payroll and they are no longer employees of the respondents.






11.
I agree with the respondents that, the amendment is not intended to clarify the real issue in controversy between the parties or to assist the court to fully resolve the question in dispute in the petition. The purpose of the intended amendment is to introduce a new cause of action and breathe new life to an obsolete petition. The amendment will bring in a new cause of action which is inconsistent with the question before the court.






12.
The new cause of action will prejudice the defence because the new cause of action means it would require a new defence. It is also an abuse of the process of the court. Consequently, I decline to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioners and dismiss the application dated 15
th
 April 2024. The petitioners are at liberty to file new suit to cater for the new cause of action. Costs of the application shall be in the cause.

Ruling










1.
This ruling is in respect to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent’s Preliminary objections dated 12
th
 August and 20
th
 August 2024 respectively. The preliminary objections challenge the Petition on several legal grounds, including failure to exhaust local remedies, vagueness,  lack of jurisdiction, ripeness and abuse of the court process.






2.
Pursuant to the directions issued by this Court on 30
th
 August 2024, the Court directed the preliminary objections to the canvassed by way of written submissions upon which the Court will render its ruling upon considering the said submissions. The 1
st
 Respondent filed its written submissions dated 5
th
 September 2024, the 2
nd
 Respondent filed its written submissions dated 3
rd
 September 2024 while the petitioners filed two sets of written submissions dated 17
th
 August 2024 and 9
th
 September 2024. No written submissions were filed by the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Respondents.






3.
In its submissions dated 5
th
 September 2024, the 1
st
 Respondent was emphatic that this Court was not the appropriate forum for determination of this dispute. It was submitted that the prayers sought in the Petition clearly point out an attempt by the Petitioners to bypass the proper legal and administrative procedures established under the 
Community Land Act
 2016, which governs disputes related to Community land management. It was also submitted that the issues raised by the Petitioners pertain to the internal operations of the 1
st
 Respondent’s management committee which the Court lacks jurisdiction to intervene and direct the affairs of the 1
st
 Respondent as requested by the Petitioners.






4.
Citing the cases of Geoffrey Muthinja & Another v Samuel Mugura Henry & 1756 others [2015] eKLR, Moses Mwicigi & 14 others v Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 5 Others [2016] eKLR and Mutanga Tea & Coffee Company Ltd v Shikara Limited & Another [2015] eKLR, it was argued that the Petitioners had failed to exhaust the local remedies provided under Section 39 of the 
Community Land Act
. It was argued that while the Petitioners argue that they were not given access to the necessary documents, they have failed to prove evidence that these alternative dispute mechanisms were unavailable or that they attempted to engage them and hence they have not provided any evidence to show that these local remedies would be ineffective.






5.
It was also submitted that the prayers sought in the Petition do not preset any constitutional remedy for the Court to address as they primarily concern matters that fall within the realm of constitutional litigation and that by seeking to frame these issues as constitutional violates, the Petitioners have misapplied the constitutional process thereby divesting the Court of its jurisdiction.






6.
On the second limb of the 1
st
 Respondent’s submissions, it was submitted that the Petition is fatally defective for failing to meet the threshold in the locus classicus case of Anarita Karimi Njeru v Republic[1979] KLR 154. It was contended that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate how the 1
st
 Respondent has violated her rights and in what manner, nature or form and that the lack of clarity prejudices the Respondents by making it difficult for them to effectively respond to the Petition. Reliance was placed on the case of Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance v Mumo Matemu & 5 others [2013] eKLR.






7.
The 2
nd
 Respondent equally submitted on the following issues; whether the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the Petition and whether the Petition is fatally defective and an abuse of the Court process.






8.
Placing reliance on the case of Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] KLR 1, Samuel Macharia & Another vs Kenya Commercial Bank Limited & 2Others [2012] eKLR and William Odhiambo Ramogi & 3 Others v Attorney General & 4 others, Muslims for Human Rights & 2 others (Interested Parties)[2020] eKLR, it was contended that the Petition is premature and that the Petitioners ought to have exhausted the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms provided under Section 39 (1), (3) and (4) of the 
Community Land Act
 and further that he Petition relates to matters outside the jurisdiction of the Court provided in Section 13 of the Environment and 
Land Act
.






9.
It was also contended that Clause 27 of the Mbulia Community Constitution stipulated that all disputes arising among the Committee shall be resolved through other conflict resolution methods such as mediation and that the Court shall only be considered as a last resort. It was submitted that the significance of internal dispute resolution mechanism cannot be gainsaid since internal remedies are designed to provide immediate and cost effective relief giving the community the opportunity to apply to own customs in resolving their disputes, rectifying irregularities first before aggrieved parties resort to litigation.






10.
It was contended that the wording of Section 39(3) and (4) of the 
Community Land Act
, Regulation 25 of the Community Land Regulations, 2017 and Clause 27 of the Mbulia Constitution is very clear and unambiguous and can have only one meaning wherein there is a dispute on community land between members, the community must first apply mediation to resolve the dispute before resorting to court process. Reliance was placed in the case of Geoffrey Muthinja (Supra) and Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya & Another vs Bryan Mandila Khaemba [2021] eKLR were cited in support.






11.
As to whether the Petition is defective and an abuse of Court process, it was submitted that the Petitioners are members of the 1
st
 Respondent and have no locus standi to bring this petition. The 2
nd
 Respondent drew support from the decision of Langat v Langat (Chairman) & 2 others (sued as officials of Kosia Set Koboor self help Group)(Environment and Land Case 243 of 2017)[2024] KEELC 4216 (KLR)






12.
The Petitioners submitted on the following issues in their submissions; whether the preliminary objections by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents can be sustained and who should bear costs. Counsel submitted that the issue before court seeks to challenge how the decision was arrived at to sell 500 acres of land from the community land and further that before the land was sold the 1
st
 Respondent’s committee was illegally in office. It was also submitted that the Petitioners wrote letters to the lands offices so that the Community Land Registrar can take action.






13.
It was further submitted that the existence of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism does not limit the Petitioners right to seek a constitutional relief and reliance was placed in the cases of Supreme Court of Kenya in Petiti
on No E007 of 2023
 between Abicha Micholas v The A.G & Others and William Odhiambo Ramogi & 3 others v A.G. & 6 others, Muslims for Human Rights & 2 others (Interested Parties) [2020] eKLR.






14.
On whether or not the Petition meets the threshold set out in Anarita Karimi Njeru case, it was submitted that the Petitioners have clearly stated that their constitutional rights were infringed for the benefit of few individuals. The Petition contains sufficient grounds to support the Petitioners claim as set out at Paragraph 12 of the Petition as well as the reliefs sought at Paragraph 16 of the Petition.






15.
As to whether or not the Petition is justiciable and ripe, it was submitted that the Petition is justiciable and the matters therein are ripe for determination. Reliance was made to the case of Alfred N. Mutua v Ethics & Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) & 4 Others [2016] eKLR, Okiya Omutatah Okoiti v Communication Authority of Kenya & 8 others [2018] eKLR and Centre for Rights Education & Awareness(CREAW) v Attorney General & Another[2015] eKLR .






16.
The Petitioners also submitted that Rule 20 of Mutunga Rules outlines how Petitions can be heard before this Court and that this Court is clothed with the relevant mechanisms on how to hear and determine the same. The Court was urged to dismiss the two preliminary objections with costs.






17.
The Court has carefully considered the objections filed by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents together with the written submissions filed by the parties and the main issue for determination is whether the objections are merited.






18.
As the contention revolves on the issue of jurisdiction, it is imperative to briefly interrogate the concept and its significance.






19.
Jurisdiction is so central in judicial proceedings, is a well settled principle in law. A Court acting without jurisdiction is acting in vain. All it engages in is nullity. Nyarangi, JA, in Owners of Motor Vessel ‘Lillian S’ v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited [1989] KLR 1 expressed himself as follows on the issue of jurisdiction:
“
Jurisdiction is everything. Without it, a court has no power to make one more step. Where a court has no jurisdiction, there would be no basis for a continuation of proceedings…""






20.
It is sufficiently settled that a Court’s jurisdiction is derived from 
the Constitution
, an Act of Parliament or a settled judicial precedent.






21.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent sought to oust the jurisdiction of this Court at the first instance based on the arguments that Section 39 as read with Section 40 and 41 of the 
Community Land Act
 2016, Regulation 25(1) of the Community Land Regulations 2017 and Clause 27 of the Mbulia Community Constitution provided avenues that ought to first address the issues before this Court assumes jurisdiction.






22.
The main objection by the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents hinges on the doctrine of exhaustion. The doctrine of exhaustion in Kenya traces its origin from Article 159(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
 which recognizes and entrenches the use of alternative mechanisms of dispute resolution. In that constitutional spirit, laws have been developed to guide how such mechanisms are to be achieved. Likewise, Courts have developed jurisprudence in support of the position that Courts must be the final arbiter in instances where alternative dispute resolution avenues are provided for in law. As said earlier, one such avenue is the doctrine of exhaustion.






23.
The doctrine of exhaustion was comprehensively dealt with by a 5-Judge Bench in Mombasa High Court Constitutional Petiti
on No. 159 of 2018
 consolidated with Constitutional Petiti
on No. 201 of 2019
 William Odhiambo Ramogi & 3 others v Attorney General & 4 others; Muslims for Human Rights & 2 others (Interested Parties) [2020] eKLR. The Court stated as follows:
“
The question of exhaustion of administrative remedies arises when a litigant, aggrieved by an agency's action, seeks redress from a Court of law on an action without pursuing available remedies before the agency itself. The exhaustion doctrine serves the purpose of ensuring that there is a postponement of judicial consideration of matters to ensure that a party is, first of all, diligent in the protection of his own interest within the mechanisms in place for resolution outside the Courts. This encourages alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in line with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 and was aptly elucidated by the High Court in R v Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (I.E.B.C) Ex Parte National Super Alliance (NASA) Kenya and 6 others [2017] eKLR, where the Court opined thus:
This doctrine is now of esteemed juridical lineage in Kenya. It was perhaps most felicitously stated by the Court of Appeal in Speaker of National Assembly v Karume [1992] KLR 21 in the following oft-repeated words:
Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures.
While this case was decided before 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010 was promulgated, many cases in the Post-2010 era have found the reasoning sound and provided justification and rationale for the doctrine under the 2010 Constitution. We can do no better in this regard than cite another Court of Appeal decision which provides the Constitutional rationale and basis for the doctrine. This is Geoffrey Muthiga Kabiru & 2 others v Samuel Munga Henry & 1756 others [2015] eKLR, where the Court of Appeal stated that:
It is imperative that where a dispute resolution mechanism exists outside Courts, the same be exhausted before the jurisdiction of the Courts is invoked. Courts ought to be fora of last resort and not the first port of call the moment a storm brews…The exhaustion doctrine is a sound one and serves the purpose of ensuring that there is a postponement of judicial consideration of matters to ensure that a party is first of all diligent in the protection of his own interest within the mechanisms in place for resolution outside the Courts. The Ex Parte Applicants argue that this accords with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 which commands Courts to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution.”






24.
Section 39 of the 
Community Land Act
, 2016 which deals with dispute resolution mechanisms under the said Act stipulates at its Section 39(2) as follows:
“
Any dispute arising between members of a registered community and another registered community shall at first instance, be resolved using any of the internal dispute resolution mechanism set out in the respective community by-laws.”






25.
Section 39 (3) also stipulates that where a dispute or conflict relating to community land arises, the registered community shall give priority to alternative method of dispute resolution.






26.
Section 42(1) stipulates as follows:
“
Where all efforts of resolving a dispute under this Act fail, a party to the dispute may refer the matter to Court.”






27.
Regulation 25(1) of the Community Land Regulations, 2017 and Clause 27 of the Mbulia Community Constitution equally provide that all disputes should be resolved through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in the first instance.






28.
In the instant case, the Petitioners have admitted at Paragraph 
2
 & 3 of their supporting affidavit dated 8
th
 August 2024 being members of the 1
st
 Respondent and as such they are bound by the applicable provisions of the law under the 
Community Land Act
 and the Mbulia Community Constitution. The said Petitioners ought to have demonstrated that they have complied with the applicable provisions of Section 39, 42 of the 
Community Land Act
 2016, Regulation 25 of the Community Land Regulations 2017 and Clause 27 of the Mbulia Community constitution. It is with noting that the 
Community Land Act
 is a post- 2010 constitution statute which was enacted being alive to the applicable provisions of the Kenyan Constitution by requiring disputes between members of a registered community land under the Act to be resolved by alternative mechanisms before moving to this Court.






29.
The court’s jurisprudential policy is to encourage parties to exhaust and honour alternative forums of dispute resolution where they are provided for by statute before approaching the court. Parties cannot veer off, waive or forfeit these dispute resolution mechanisms as they do not exist in vain. The Court cannot close its eye and overlook the undisputed fact that the dispute should be considered through the provided mechanisms in the first instance. The mere fact that a party pleads constitutional violation doesn’t automatically imply that the Court should proceed and determine the Petition as it is in the first instance since the doctrine of exhaustion spells otherwise. The Petitioners cannot take advantage of the court’s constitutional jurisdiction over the matter herein without applying the doctrine of exhaustion and adhered to the guiding principles therein.






30.
Consequently, this Court finds merit in the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents’ preliminary objections and proceeds to issue the following orders:
a.
The Petition and Notice of Motion both dated 8
th
 August 2024 are hereby struck out.
b.
Each party to bear own costs.
Orders accordingly.

          (Being an appeal from the conviction and sentence arising in Nyeri Law Courts Sexual Offences case number 49 of 2018 delivered on 12th October, 2022 by Hon. W. Kagendo, C.M)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant herein was charged with the offence of incest contrary to Section 20 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The particulars were that on diverse dates between 2015 to 2016 at [particulars withheld] village in Nyeri District within Nyeri County being a male person caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of C.W., a female person who to his knowledge his daughter.
In the alternative, he was charged with the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. Particulars of the alternative charge were that on diverse dates between 2015 to 2016 at [particulars withheld] village in Nyeri District within Nyeri County, he intentionally and unlawfully touched the vagina of C.W., a child aged 14 years, with his penis.






2.
The Appellant denied the charges, and the case proceeded to trial. The prosecution called four witnesses, and when put on his defence, the appellant testified and called one witness.






3.
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial magistrate found the Appellant guilty of the main charge, convicted him, and sentenced him to serve five years imprisonment.






4.
The Appellant, dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, filed a petition of appeal, raising seven grounds of appeal:
I.
That the judgment of the Honourable Court failed to consider the fact that the prosecution did not prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.
II.
The Honourable Court relied on the evidence of the complainant which was not corroborated and lacked probative value.
III.
The evidence by the prosecution was full of contradictions and cannot support a conviction.
IV.
The degree of proof in a case of indecent assault was not met.
V.
The Honourable Chief Magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the accused and entire defence.
VI.
The medical evidence produced was insufficient to support the offence or a conviction.
VII.
The judgment, conviction and sentence were against the weight of evidence, and the law and the same is excessive






5.
The parties relied entirely on their written submissions at the appeal hearing. The appellant submitted that the ingredients of the offence of defilement were not proved, and the prosecution did not discharge the burden of proof.






6.
The appeal has been conceded by the State. Learned State Counsel Ms. Mwaniki conceded that there was insufficient evidence to support the main count.






7.
PW1 testified she was 15 years old and that the appellant was her stepfather. She testified that the appellant would visit and stay with her and her younger sibling, M.G., at their Ruringu house while their mother was receiving medical treatment in Nairobi. She testified that she and her brother would sleep in the bedroom, and the appellant would sleep on the couch in the sitting room. She told the court that the appellant would call her through her phone and request her not to lock the main door and that when he got home, he woke her up at night and threatened her with a kitchen knife, removed her nightgown and panty, and proceeded to defile her. It was her testimony that the appellant defiled her six times on varying dates and threatened her in the same way using the same knife. She stated that after the first occurrence, she threw the blood-stained bedsheet away. She was unable to provide specific dates or time periods when the alleged offences were committed against her. She accused the appellant of violence directed at her mother (PW2). She stated that she refrained from confiding in her mother or anyone else due to the appellant's threats against her and her young brother's lives. She also stated that the appellant's presence consistently prevented her from having the opportunity to speak with her mother about the ordeals. According to PW1, she told her mother about the defilement after an argument ensued between them.






8.
PW2 was the complainant's mother. She told the court that she was in a relationship with the appellant and lived together between 2009 and 2018. She testified that she was hospitalized between 21
st
 July, 2015 to 17
th
 September, 2015 following an operation. She stated that she would leave her two children with the appellant when traveling to Nairobi for medical review. According to PW2, she learnt of the defilement incidences when the complainant broke down after an argument and accused the appellant of defiling her severally. She told the court that she escorted the complainant to the police and subsequent medical examination. In cross-examination, PW2 denied that the case was fabricated due to differences between herself and the appellant. She maintained that she had confidence in the appellant when she left the children in his custody.






9.
The clinical officer, PW3, testified on behalf of his colleague who examined PW1. According to PW3, PW1 was examined on 29
th
 November, 2018. He testified that the complainant's hymen was broken, although not recently. He stated further that vaginal discharge was noted on examination and produced the post-rape care form and P3 Form.






10.
PW4 was the investigating officer. She testified that the offence was reported to Nyeri Central Police Station on 29
th
 November, 2018, and the Appellant was arrested on 7
th
 December, 2018. She stated that she interrogated the complainant, who disclosed to her that the appellant had sexually assaulted her six times, and she concluded that the complainant was truthful.






11.
When the Appellant was placed on his defence, he gave a sworn statement. He denied the charge. He went into detail about the history of his relationship and stated that he had another family and children. At the time they met, PW2 had the complainant. He said that when PW2 was admitted, he only stayed with PW1 and her brother for three days before he took them to their aunt, PW2’s sister, to look after them. The thread running through his defence was that they had a strained relationship with PW2 and that he was a victim of a trumped-up charge. According to the appellant, he was arrested around the time when he was receiving his pension after being laid off from Telkom, which he believes was the main reason for the alleged fabrication of the charge. DW2 corroborated DW1's testimony on the strained relationship between DW1 and PW2. He also stated that he used to work with the appellant at Telkom, maintaining cables, which involved extensive patrolling and travelling.






12.
As the first appellate court, I am duty bound to `re-evaluate, re-examine and re-assess afresh the evidence tendered before the trial court to arrive at an independent conclusion or determination without losing sight of the fact that the trial court had the advantage of seeing and listening to the witnesses to assess their demeanour. These principles are laid out in Okeno and Another Vs. Republic (1972) E.A 32.






13.
The appellant was charged with an offence of incest by a male person contrary to section 201(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and, in the alternative, charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. I have considered the grounds of appeal herein against the record of appeal and submissions of both parties. The prosecution was required to establish the following ingredients: -
i.
The relationship between the victim and the perpetrator;
ii.
The age of the victim;
iii.
Whether there was penetration;
iv.
Whether the perpetrator was identified and linked to the offence.






14.
Section 22 of the said Act identifies the test of relationship in the following manner;
“
In case of the offence of incest, brother and sister include half-brother, half-sister and adoptive brother and adoptive sister and a father includes a half-father and uncle of the first decree, and a mother includes a half-mother and an aunty of the first decree whether through lawful wedlock or not.”






15.
On the relationship, it is not disputed that at the time of the alleged defilement, the appellant was married to PW2, the complainant’s biological mother. They lived together and had one child together; the appellant was the complainant’s stepfather, and the appellant conceded to this in his evidence.






16.
Is a stepfather considered a father under section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
? The Court of Appeal addressed this question in the case of LOA v Republic [2020] eKLR;
“
The appellant submits that being a stepdaughter, she was not his daughter. That a step-daughter is not one of the persons with whom a male person is guilty of incest if found to have had sexual intercourse with. On the other hand, the respondent takes a contrary view; that a step-daughter is just as good as a daughter as she is among the persons whom a parent is prohibited from having sex with. Section 22 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, sets out the persons with whom having sex with will amount to incest. These are brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, adoptive brother and sister, father, half-father, uncle of first degree, mother and mother and an aunt of the first degree. No doubt the appellant was PW1’s half-father and or stepfather. Therefore, the two having sex was incestuous.”






17.
The relationship between the appellant and the complainant, therefore, falls within the definitions provided for under Section 22 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
; the two having sex would be incestuous.






18.
Regarding whether the complainant's age was proved, the prosecution produced the complainant's Birth Certificate, indicating she was born on 28
th
 February 2004. I am thus satisfied that the complainant was a minor at the time of the incident complained of.






19.
On whether there was penetration, the incidents complained of were alleged to have occurred on diverse dates between the years 2015 to 2016. The medical examination was conducted in November 2018, given the period between the incidents and the examination, there was no forensic evidence to support penetration.






20.
Proof of penetration is required in proving a sexual offence, but it need not be proven solely by medical evidence. In the case of E.E v Republic [2015] eKLR, the court expressed itself on the question of penetration as follows;
“
Penetration’ means the partial or complete insertion of the genital organ of a person in the genital organ of another person.
The penetration or act of sexual intercourse has therefore to be proved to sustain a charge of defilement. In Bassita Hussein VS Uganda, Supreme Court criminal appeal No. 35 of 1995”,
The court stated:-
“
The act of sexual intercourse or penetration may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Usually, the sexual intercourse is proved by the victim's oral evidence and corroborated by medical evidence or other evidence.”






21.
In this case, the trial court convicted the appellant based on the complainant's evidence. Under Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, a court can convict based on the evidence of the victim alone in sexual offences. The critical question is whether the complainant was truthful and if the evidence, considered as a whole, points to the appellant as the perpetrator.






22.
The complainant claimed to have been sexually assaulted around 2015 and 2016. There was no attempt to estimate dates, months, or descriptions that would have clarified when the incidents occurred. It wasn’t until 2018 when the case was reported. It is also clear that the relationship between PW2 and the appellant had deteriorated around the same time. According to the prosecution witnesses, the incident was reported following an argument between PW2 and her daughter, the complainant. PW2 stated that, as a result of the argument, she had threatened to hit the complainant with an iron box. The complainant then went on her knees and told PW2 that she wanted to report what had transpired during her absence while receiving medical attention. These circumstances raise questions as to why the complainant did not report the defilement earlier despite the passage of time and chose to make the complaint at that specific time. The defence of victimization because of the hostility between the appellant and PW2 cannot be ignored, given that there is evidence, including from the complainant, that she would take sides during their conflicts.






23.
Even though a court has the power to convict under Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, this section should be applied with the utmost care and only be used when the victim's evidence is absolutely clear and without any doubt. This provision cannot be relied upon to save a weak prosecution case. It is not intended to evoke sympathy.






24.
Whereas innumerable witnesses need not be called to prove a case, some require the prosecution to call additional witnesses to dispel any doubt. In this case, there were glaring loopholes, and witnesses were mentioned but not called; one, Grace, who is stated to have been assisting in taking care of the complainant and her brother, is such a witness. This case required the court to exercise caution in relying on the complainant's sole testimony.






25.
The lower court record shows that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP), through the Prosecution Counsel, addressed a letter dated 8th December 2020 indicating that they had considered the evidence and opined that it was insufficient evidence to prove criminal culpability. As the respondents in this case, they conceded to the appeal. The letter and submissions were based on concerns about a potential miscarriage of justice due to doubts about the commission of the offence. It is imperative that the court process is never manipulated or exploited for the purpose of settling personal scores.






26.
I am satisfied that the prosecution's evidence did not meet the threshold of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed, and the sentence set aside.
It is so ordered.

NW (Minor suing through her next friend Purity Wanjiru Miruru)


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of Honourable P.O. Ooko delivered on the 17th day of January, 2024 in Kiambu CMCC E301 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This judgment relates to the memorandum of appeal dated  12
th
 February, 2024. It is an appeal from the Judgment of Hon. P.O. Ooko, Senior Principal Magistrate, delivered on 17
th
 January, 2024 in Kiambu Chief Magistrate’s Court Civil Suit No. E301 of 2021.






2.
The Respondent filed the CMCC case against the Appellant, seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident that occurred on November 16, 2020, along Northern Bypass Road. The accident involved motor vehicle registration number KCG 159N and motor vehicle KCN 218A, in which the plaintiff was traveling as a fare-paying passenger.






3.
The trial court adopted the liability finding from a test suit in Kiambu CMCC no. 304 of 2021, between Salome Wambui Miruru and Ezekiel Ken Otieno Karia. In the judgment delivered on 28
th
 November, 2022, liability was determined to be 100%. The trial court addressed itself on the issue of quantum and awarded Kshs. 150,000/- as general damages for the injuries sustained and Kshs. 3,550/- as special damages.






4.
The Appellant has raised 16 grounds of appeal, which are:
I.
The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant was wholly liable for the occurrence of the alleged accident.
II.
The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in finding that the plaintiff had discharged their burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.
III.
The learned magistrate erred both in law and in fact to appreciate that the plaintiff’s evidence was misleading and fraudulent.
IV.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to consider the defence evidence tendered to find the plaintiff’s case as fraudulent.
V.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact and he misdirected himself in failing to appreciate the principle of a just and fair hearing.
VI.
The learned trial magistrate’s decision occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
VII.
The learned trial magistrate acted on wrong principles of law.
VIII.
The learned chief magistrate misdirected himself in law by assessing general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities that were manifestly excessive and incomparable to the common judicial awards.
IX.
The learned magistrate erred in awarding the respondent the sum of Kshs. 150, 000/= for general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities and the sum of Kshs. 3, 550/= for special damages.
X.
The award in quantum of general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities in the circumstances is so inordinately high that it amounts to a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages suffered by the respondent.
XI.
The award in quantum of damages of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities is altogether disproportionate and is not in keeping with other comparable awards made in respect of similar circumstances.
XII.
The learned chief magistrate erred both in law and in giving a very high award in quantum of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities contrary to the evidence given in court.
XIII.
The learned chief magistrate erred in law in making such a high award as to show that the magistrate acted on wrong principles of law.
XIV.
The learned chief magistrate’s award on general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities was inordinately high as to be entirely erroneous.
XV.
The learned chief magistrate erred in fact and law by totally disregarding the appellant’s submissions and authorities in making a finding on quantum of damages.
XVI.
The judgment on quantum of damages was against the weight of the evidence.






3.
The Appellant seeks for orders that:-
a.
The appeal be allowed.
b.
This honourable court be pleased to vary, vacate, review and/ or set aside the judgment of the lower court both on liability and quantum.
c.
This honourable court be pleased to order that the respondent’s case in the lower court stands dismissed with costs.
d.
In the alternative to prayer (c) above, that this honourable court be pleased to review or set aside the award on quantum.
e.
This honourable court be pleased to assess downwards the quantum of damages awarded to the respondent.
f.
The respondent pays the costs of this appeal and the costs in the lower court.
g.
Such further relief be granted as may appear just and expedient.






4.
Parties agreed to canvass the appeal through written submissions. The Appellant filed written submissions dated 6
th
 June, 2024, while the Respondent did not.






Analysis And Determination


5.
In 
Mursal & another v Manese (suing as the legal administrator of Dalphine Kanini Manesa) (Civil Appeal E20 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 282 (KLR) (6 April 2022) (Judgment) the court stated as follows:
“


2.
A first appellate court is mandated to re-evaluate the evidence before the trial court as well as the judgment and arrive at its own independent judgment on whether or not to allow the appeal. A first appellate court is empowered to subject the whole of the evidence to a fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and make conclusions about it, bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses first hand. This duty was stated in Selle & another v Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd.& others and in Peters v Sunday Post Limited.”








6.
I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the record of appeal, and the submissions before this court and find that the issues that arise for determination are whether the apportionment of liability was correct, whether the award of general damages was excessive to warrant interference by this court and who should bear the costs of the appeal.








Liability;


7.
This court is being called upon to interfere with the liability apportioned by the trial court. The lower court record shows that on 22
nd
 November, 2024, the parties informed the court that liability had been determined in a test suit - Kiambu CMCC 304 of 2021 - and proceeded on quantum through written submissions. A copy of the judgment in the test suit was furnished to the court on the same date. The Judgment was delivered on 28
th
 November, 2022.






8.
The Civil Procedure Rules provide for test suits in Order 38 Rules 1 and 2; -
Order 38 – Selection of Test Suit
[Order 38, Rule 1.]: Staying several suits against the same defendant
Where two or more persons have instituted suits against the same defendant and such persons under rule 1 of Order I could have been joined as co-plaintiffs in one suit, upon the application of any of the parties with notice to all affected parties, the court may, if satisfied that the issues to be tried in each suit are precisely similar, make an order directing that one of the suits be tried as a test case, and staying all steps in the other suits until the selected suit shall have been determined, or shall have failed to be a real trial of the issues.
[Order 38, Rule 2.] Staying similar suits upon application by defendant
Where a plaintiff has instituted two or more suits, and under rule 3 of Order 1 the several dependants could properly have been joined as co-defendants in one suit, the court, if satisfied upon the application of a defendant that the issues to be tried in the suit to which he is a party are precisely similar to the issues to be determined in another of such suits, may order that the suit to which such defendant is a party be stayed until such other suit shall have been determined or shall have failed to be a real trial of the issues.






9.
The Appellant acknowledged in his submissions on appeal and before the lower court that the case Kiambu CMCC E304/2021 had been selected as a test suit. The accident was the same cause of action in the case now on appeal. Once liability was established in the test suit, it was binding and applied to the other cases within the scope of the test suit.






10.
The judgment in the test suit shows that liability was entered at 100% against the defendant, who is the appellant in this case. The issue of liability was fully determined in the test suit, and the trial court in Kiambu CMCC E301/2021 was bound to adopt the apportioned liability or provide reasons for departing from it. The trial court correctly adopted the finding on liability.








Quantum;


11.
The Respondent pleaded in the plaint dated 29
th
 March, 2021 that she sustained the following injuries;
a.
Blunt head injuries
b.
Blunt trauma to the right eye
c.
Soft tissue injuries- both hands






12.
In Jane Chelagat Bor vs. Andrew Otieno Onduu [1988-92] 2 KAR 288; [1990-1994] EA 47, the Court of Appeal held that:
“
In effect, the court before it interferes with an award of damages, should be satisfied that the Judge acted on wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the fact, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered. It is not enough that there is a balance of opinion or preference. The scale must go down heavily against the figure attacked if the appellate court is to interfere, whether on the ground of excess or insufficiency.”






13.
My duty as an appellate court is threefold regarding the quantum of damages: -
(a)
To ascertain whether the Court applied irrelevant factors or left out relevant factors;
(b)
To ascertain whether the award is too high as to amount to an erroneous assessment of damages;
(c)
The award is simply not justified by evidence.






14.
Both parties confirmed to the trial court that they were proceeding with the assessment of quantum through written submissions. The trial court considered the authorities that the parties relied on in their submissions when assessing damages. The respondent proposed an award of Kshs. 350,000/-, whereas the Appellant submitted an award of Kshs. 100,000/- as adequate compensation for the injuries sustained.






15.
The Appellant relied on the case of Ndungu Dennis v Ann Wangari Ndirangu & Another [2018] eKLR, in which the Respondent sustained soft tissue injuries to the lower right leg and soft tissue injuries to the back (trunk). The court awarded Kshs. 100,000/- as general damages.






16.
The Respondent relied on Meru HCCC No. 70 of 2019 John Mwendwa Kuti & Another v Ibrahim Kunyaga F. Gikonyo, J. The court awarded Kshs. 350,000/- as damages to the respondent who sustained mild head injuries and further relied on the authority of where the Respondent was awarded Kshs.350,000/- as general damages for blunt injury to the chest, bruises of the lower abdomen, bruises of the right hip joint, bruises of the thigh, and bruises on the knee.






17.
I find that the injuries outlined in the authorities the Respondent relied upon are more severe than those in the present case. The Respondent’s injuries were classified as soft tissue injuries of moderate severity. The trial court further considered a comparative analysis, the age of the authorities, and inflationary trends. Based on the above precedents, I find that the Lower court’s exercise of discretion in this issue was reasonable, and, therefore, I decline to upset the lower court’s finding on the same. The Kshs.150,000/- award as general damages was adequate in light of the injuries sustained.






18.
The award of Ksh.3,550 /- as special damages is as pleaded and proved. The same remains as awarded.






19.
Accordingly, the appeal is not merited and is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.






20.
It is so ordered.

          ((Being an appeal against the Judgment and Decree of Hon. S.Mwangi, Senior Resident Magistrate delivered on 11th January, 2023 in Murang’a MCELRC No.6 of 2019))
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellant was employed by the respondent from 29
th
 October 2012 till 30
th
 October 2018 when her employment was terminated. She filed suit in the lower court seeking compensation for unfair termination and terminal dues. The respondent filed defence denying liability but tendered no evidence during the trial. After considering the evidence tendered by the appellant, the trial court (Hon.S.Mwangi, SRM) held that the appellant had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability and dismissed the same with costs.






2.
The appellant was aggrieved and filed this appeal seeking the court to set aside the lower court judgment and in its place grant the prayers sought in the suit. The appeal stands on the following grounds: -
a.
The learned Trial Magistrate erred by failing to apply sections 41,43,44,45 and 47 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007, in so far as they are applicable to resolve the Appellant’s claim, including by failing to consider: -
i.
Whether there was a valid reason disclosed by the Respondent to terminate the Appellant’s employment.
ii.
Whether the Respondent conducted a fair hearing in accordance with the law prior to issuing the letter of termination.
iii.
Whether the terminal dues owed and confirmed as due and owing by the Respondent were paid to the Appellant at all.
iv.
Whether the Respondent had discharged its burden of proof to demonstrate that the termination was effected for a valid reason and that the requisite fair procedure was complied with.
v.
Whether the Appellant discharged her burden of proof that the terminal dues owed by the Respondent were not paid.
vi.
Whether the termination of the Appellant by the claimant was unfair and unlawful.
b.
The learned Magistrate erred in law by failing to evaluate, weigh and consider the evidence placed by the claimant before the court.
c.
The learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact by finding that the Appellant’s case was not proved to the required standard.
d.
The learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to substantively hear the evidence of the Appellant and determine the dispute on its merits.
e.
The learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to find that the Respondent’s did not tender any evidence to support their defence and to counteract and/or rebut the Appellant’s evidence.
f.
The learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in exercising her discretion by misdirecting herself and by failing to consider the evidence of the Appellant and by considering matters and/or facts which she should not have considered and/or by failing to take into consideration matters and/or facts which she should have taken into consideration and in doing so arriving at a wrong decision.
g.
The learned Magistrate misdirected herself on issues of law and fact and therefore arrived at a wrong finding.
h.
The judgment of the learned Magistrate contradicted the weight of evidence placed and adduced before the court.








Factual background


3.
During the trial, the appellant testified as CW1 and adopted her written statement plus 8 documents as her evidence in chief. In brief, her evidence was that she was employed by the respondent on 29
th
 October 2012 as a Technical Mechanic for a gross monthly salary of Kshs.70,000. However, from July 2016 to July 2018, her salary was unilaterally reduced by the employer by Kshs.20,000 and then increased by Kshs.10,000 from August to October 2018.






4.
On 30
th
 October 2018, the respondent unfairly and unlawfully terminated her employment without any lawful cause or reason and without giving her any opportunity to be heard as required by section 45 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007. She then entered into an agreement with the respondent vide which she was to be paid three months’ salary in lieu of notice, 23.75 leave days, service pay at the rate of 15 days per year for the 7 years served, withheld salary in respect of the unilateral reduction, HELB deductions and penalties (Kshs.94,186) and salary arrears (Kshs.69,361).






5.
The respondent only paid Kshs.163,547 comprising salary arrears and HELB deductions and penalties. The respondent ignored demand for payment and the appellant filed this suit seeking Kshs.895,492 terminal dues as per the agreement dated 30
th
 October 2018 plus Kshs.840,000 being 12 months salary as damages for unfair termination. She also prayed for costs.








Submissions


6.
It was submitted for the appellant that her employment was unfairly terminated by the respondent for no valid reason and without prior notice or being accorded any hearing as required by Section 41 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007. It was submitted that the termination was therefore unlawful, unfair and unjustified as the respondent did not discharge its burden of proof of fairness and justification. Reliance was placed on the case of Waite v Lets Go Travel Limited (2022) KEELRC 1163 (KLR).






7.
In view of the foregoing matters, it was submitted that the appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought. Reliance on the Court of Appeal decision in Coastal Bottlers v Kimathi Mithika (2018) eKLR that a settlement agreement constitutes a binding contract.






8.
As regards compensatory damages, it was urged that the maximum award of 12 months was justified because the appellant was exposed to diminished income and unnecessary embarrassing treatment.






9.
On the part of the respondent, it was submitted that the appellant was duly notified and she attended a meeting in which her terminal dues were computed. Consequently, it was urged that the respondent complied with section 41 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
. It was further submitted that the agreement failed to tender evidence to prove unfair termination as required by section 47 (5) of the 
Employment Act
, 2007.






10.
It was submitted that the respondent filed a list of documents dated 13
th
 July 2021 including a CR12 for Evereg Exporters Limited to prove that the appellant had registered a company to compete with the respondent in the same business and to confuse the potential customers by the names. Consequently, it was submitted that the respondent had proved that it had a valid reason for terminating the appellant’s employment as required under section 43 and 47 (5) of the 
Employment Act
, 2007.






11.
In view of the foregoing matters, it was submitted that the appellant is not entitled to the reliefs sought in the lower suit since she failed to prove the same. Besides, it was submitted that she had admitted receipt of Kshs.163,547 and as such she is estopped from the reliefs sought. Consequently, the court was urged to dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent.








Analysis and determination


12.
This being a first appeal, my mandate is to re-evaluate the evidence on record and arrive at my own independent conclusion, but with a precaution that I did not see the witnesses during their testimony. I am guided by the decision of Court of Appeal in the case of Selle v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd (1968) EA 123 where the court held thus: -
“
The appellate court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from a trial by the High Court is by way of a retrial and the principles upon which the Court of Appeal acts are that the court must consider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, the court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial Judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate he evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






13.
Having considered the record of appeal and the submission herein, the following issues fall for determination: -
a.
Whether the respondent terminated the appellant’s employment unfairly and unlawfully.
b.
Whether the appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought in the suit.






Unlawful and unfair termination


14.
Section 45 (1) and (2) of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 provides that: -
“
(1)
No employer shall terminate the employment of an employee unfairly.
(2)
A termination of employment by an employer is unfair if the employer fails to prove –
a.
That the reason for the termination is valid;
b.
That the reason for the termination is a fair reason -
i.
Related to the employee’s conduct, capacity or compatibility, or
ii.
Based on the operational requirements of the employer; and
c.
That the employment was terminated in accordance with fair procedure.”






15.
In this case, the termination was vide the letter dated 26
th
 September 2018 which gave one month notice up to 30
th
 October 2018 when the separation was to take effect. The letter did not cite any reason for the termination but under paragraph 5 of the response to the claim, the respondent pleaded that the appellant had started a company called Evereg Exporters Ltd to do competing business in flagrant breach of conflict of interest which went against the terms of his contract. It averred that the said conduct justified summary dismissal but it opted to terminate the contract by notice.






16.
The foregoing pleading is an admission that the appellant’s employment was terminated for a reason which was not explained to her before the decision was taken as required under section 41 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007 which provides that: -
“
(1)
Subject to section 42(1), an employer shall, before terminating the employment of an employee, on the grounds of misconduct, poor performance or physical incapacity explain to the employee, in a language the employee understands, the reason for which the employer is considering termination and the employee shall be entitled to have another employee or a shop floor union representative of his choice present during this explanation.
(2)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, an employer shall, before terminating the employment of an employee or summarily dismissing an employee under section 44(3) or (4) hear and consider any representations which the employee may on the grounds of misconduct or poor performance, and the person, if any, chosen by the employee within subsection (1), make.”






17.
The emerging jurisprudence in Kenya is that even where employer serves a termination notice or pays salary in lieu as provided by the contract or the statutes, the employer has a legal duty to accord the employee a hearing as required under section 41 above. I gather support from the Court of Appeal decision in Kenfreight EA Limited v Benson K. Nguti [2016] eKLR, thus: -
“
Apart from issuing proper notice according to the contract (or payment in lieu of notice as provided) an employer is duty bound to explain to the employee in the presence of another employee or a union official, in a language the employee understands, the reason or reasons for which the employer is considering termination of the contract. In addition, the employee is entitled to be heard and his representations if any, considered by an employer before the decision to terminate his contract of service is taken.”






18.
In this case, the respondent filed a defence but failed to adduce evidence to rebut the appellant’s evidence and to prove its defence case. The failure by a respondent to adduce evidence to prove its defence rendered the defence futile. As such, I find that the respondent did not discharge its burden of proof under section 43 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
, which requires an employer to prove substantive and procedural fairness in its separation with the appellant. Consequently, the termination was unfair and unlawful.






19.
In arriving at the foregoing conclusion, I have satisfied myself that the trial court erred both in law and fact by holding that the termination was fair and lawful because the appellant was served with one-month notice before the termination. As indicated above, even where notice has been served or salary in lieu of notice is paid, the employer is not absolved from the legal duty to act fairly by according the employee a hearing in the presence of another employee. The said duty becomes more pronounced where the employer is terminating the employment for a reason.








Reliefs


20.
In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the appellant gave sufficient evidence which proved unfair termination on a balance of probability. As such, I find she is entitled to declaration that the termination of her employment was unfair and unlawful.






21.
Under section 49 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007, she is entitled to compensation for unfair termination. Considering that no offence was proved against her, and that she had served for six years, I award her four months’ salary equalling to Kshs.280,000. However, she is not entitled to the claim for salary in lieu of notice because she served with one-month notice before termination. Further, she did not adduce any evidence to prove that she was entitled to three months’ notice before termination.






22.
The claim for withheld salary of Kshs.20,000 per month from July 2016 to July 2018 was admitted in the computation letter dated 25
th
 October 2018 and the agreement to pay the dues by instalments dated 30
th
 October 2018. The same was admitted with respect to Kshs.10,000 withheld from August to October 2018. There are also letters dated 29
th
 July 2016 and 30
th
 July 2018 confirming the said salary reduction without prior consent from the appellant. Hence, she is entitled to Kshs.20,000 x 24=Kshs.480,000 plus Kshs.10,000 x 3=Kshs.30,000 as withheld salary totalling to Kshs.510,000.






23.
She is also entitled to claim for leave of 23.75 days as admitted in the computation dated 30
th
 October 2018. Hence Kshs.70,000 x 23.75/30=Kshs.55,416.66.






24.
The claim for service pay is merited as it was also admitted in the said computation of terminal dues by the respondent. The respondent did not adduce any evidence during the hearing to prove that the appellant had registered for NSSF and it duly contributes for his benefit. Had that been the case, the respondent could not have factored the said benefit in the computation dated 30
th
 October 2018. Hence the appellant is entitled to service pay at the rate of 15 days salary for every year of service for six years equalling to Kshs.210,000.






25.
Finally, the appellant is not entitled to the claim for HELB deductions and penalties of Kshs.94,186 and salary arrears of Kshs.69,361 since she admitted that the said sum was paid vide deposit slip dated 3
rd
 December 2018.










Conclusion


26.
I have found that the appellant proved her case of unfair termination on a balance of probability. She also proved the claim for compensatory damages and terminal dues as highlighted above. Consequently, I allow the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment, and award the appellant the following orders: -
i.
A declaration that the termination of the appellant’s employment by the respondent was unlawful and unfair.
ii.
Compensation for unfair termination …………………Kshs.280,000.00
iii.
Withheld salary………………………………………………..Kshs.510,000.00
iv.
Leave……………………………………………………………….Kshs.55,416.66
v.
Service pay………………………………………………………
Kshs.210,000.00
Kshs.1,055,416.66
vi.
The award is subject to statutory deductions.
vii.
The Appellant is awarded costs of the appeal and court below.
viii.
The Appellant is awarded interest at court rates from the date of the judgment.

Judgment










1.
The claimant brought this suit on 28
th
 December, 2023 seeking the following reliefs: -
a.
A declaration that the actions of the respondent amount to constructive dismissal of the claimant.
b.
A declaration that the respondent violated the claimant’s rights as an employee.
c.
An order compelling the respondent to pay the claimant commensurate salary and all salary increments due to her position of senior factory manager from 2013.
d.
An order compelling the respondent to pay the claimant all her services and terminal dues.
e.
An order for General damages for unlawful dismissal equal to one (1) year.
f.
An order for costs of the suit and interests.
g.
Any other and or better order as may meet the ends of justice.






2.
The Respondent denied the alleged constructive dismissal and averred that the claimant evaded disciplinary hearing and mutual separation and voluntarily resigned from her job. Therefore, it prayed for the suit to be dismissed with costs.






Evidence


3.
The claimant testified as CW1. She testified that she joined the respondent on 1
st
 October, 1999 as a Cherry Recorder and rose through the ranks. In 2009, she was promoted to factory manager and in 2013 she became Senior Factory Manager based at the Head Office. In that position, she was in charge of all the four factories and answerable to the CEO/Secretary Manager. However, her promotion coincided with the promotion of Mr.Stephen Gichunge to the position of CEO and her life became hell because the new CEO did not recognise her new position instead he subjected her to move from one factory to another as Factory Manager between 2015 and 2022 and further denied her chance to attend trips like the other factory managers.






4.
On 17
th
 July 2023, she was suspended on the basis of vague grounds. Thereafter, she was invited to a disciplinary hearing on 30
th
 August 2023 but the meeting did not proceed and she was asked to leave the meeting. On 12
th
 September 2023, she was invited for another hearing but only her trade union officials were allowed into the meeting which went on from 10.00am to 1.30pm when she was given a show cause letter to respond to the same day. She was unable to meet the deadline and considered the short notice as harassment. As such, she never responded to the letter.






5.
She remained in the suspension until 9
th
 November, 2023 when she instructed a lawyer to serve a demand letter but the respondent served the claimant with a letter accusing her of absconding work. Sensing trouble, she tendered a resignation on 14
th
 November 2023 and the respondent accepted the resignation.






6.
She contended that the resignation was involuntarily but due to the respondent’s conduct including withholding salary from February 2023 and placing her under long suspension. She contended that the work environment had become unbearable. She was also not being issued with pay slip. She had not protested against the above matters because she loved her job. She contended that her salary as Cherry Recorder was Kshs.8,900.00 but when she became Factory Manager in 2009, her basic salary was Kshs.13,500.00. Her salary never changed after she became Senior Factory Manager and therefore she did not get to know the correct salary for that position.






7.
On cross-examination, she confirmed that the payslips filed by the respondent belonged to her but she reiterated that she received salary after February 2023. She admitted that she had loan from Capital Sacco and Imenti Sacco (Golden Pillar) and she paid through her business and salary. However, she admitted that she received SMS through her phone stating that her loans were not being serviced.






8.
She confirmed that the respondent had four factories each headed by a Factory Manager who were transferable. She contended that there was a position of Senior Factory Manager to which she was promoted and was allocated an office at the Headquarters at Gichugene factory. She was also overseeing the other three factories.






9.
Her salary came from the respondent but it was paid through Meru Central Cooperative Union. Her promotion letter to senior factory manager never mentioned salary. For the 24 years she served, she never complained about failure to be issued with pay slips.






10.
She contended that her disciplinary process was never concluded as she asked his lawyer to pursue mutual separation. However, she declined to sign the separation agreement because her lawyer never involved her in the negotiation meeting.






11.
In re-examination, she confirmed that from 1999 to 2013 she was being given pay slips but thereafter she was not given including the copies filed herein by the respondent.






12.
The respondent’s Secretary Manager Mr.Stephen Gichunge testified as RW1. He testified that the respondent has four factories namely Gichungene, Kinjo, Riiie and Kijijone each under a Factory Manager. The factory managers report to the Secretary Managers. He stated that the claimant was promoted to a factory manager in 2009 and denied that she was promoted further to Senior Factory Manager/Assistant Secretary Manager. He clarified that there is no position of Senior Factory Manager in the respondent’s Management Structure.






13.
He denied the allegation that the claimant was discriminated against or in any way unfairly treated through transfers, and contended that a Factory Manager was transferable from one factory to another. Further, that all the four factory managers were equally affected by the routine transfers/rotations which were not in any way a punishment. He further denied that he had a personal vendetta against the claimant and averred that the claimant never at any one time invoked the available internal dispute resolution mechanism against him or any other officer of the respondent.






14.
He clarified that there were various concerns raised against the claimant’s work and performance including authorising another employee, John Mukiri to use her System Password to handle stocks and weigh cherry which led to issues with cherry weights recorded; manipulating cherry weight and giving fictitious quantities to herself and member number 3931, Joy Kathure; and reporting poor ratios for other farmers leading to respondent’s reputational risk in the market.






15.
He denied that the respondent withheld salary from the claimant and averred that no officer of the respondent can interfere with salary of other employees since the same is handled by the HR Department of the Meru Central Coffee Union. He maintained that the claimant’s salary was paid every month less statutory deductions and loan deductions.






16.
He further stated that the claimant was issued with a show cause letter to a disciplinary hearing and responded by a resignation letter. In that regard, RW1 averred that the claimant is not entitled to the reliefs sought and prayed for the suit to be dismissed.






17.
On cross-examination, he denied that he discriminated the claimant by denying her chances to go for trips like the other managers. He contended that the claimant’s retirement was to be in 2023 when she was to attain 55 years.






18.
He admitted that the letters inviting the claimant to disciplinary hearing did not indicate any charges or allegations against her. He further admitted that suspension was supposed to last for 60 days from 17
th
 July 2023 but she was not called back because disciplinary hearing had not been done. He also admitted that she wrote letter dated 9
th
 November 2023 complaining of prolonged suspension and he wrote a letter to her accusing her of absconding duty.






19.
He contended that the claimant was paid salary up to December 2023 and stated that she has not filed her bank statement to disprove the said payment. He admitted that he signed the letter promoting the claimant to Senior Factory Manager but clarified that the claimant was never given a confirmation letter in respect of that position. He averred that the salary increase for new position was to be determined by the Management after confirmation of the promotion. He contended that the claimant refused to sign a mutual separation agreement.






20.
Respondent’s chairman Mr.Daniel Muruingi testified as RW2. He reiterated the evidence by the RW1. He admitted that the claimant was promoted to factory manager in 2009 and thereafter to Senior Factory Manager. However, the position of the Senior Manager was not in the Respondent’s Management Structure and the idea of promoting the claimant to the said position was coined by the Secretary Manager and the former chairperson without involvement of the entire Board or following the right procedure of creating a new office. Consequently, the said promotion was never confirmed and she continued serving as a factory manager.






21.
RW2 denied that the claimant was treated harshly or discriminated against by anyone in the respondent’s service, hence her long service in the respondent. He contended that, the claimant worked with RW1 for ten years and she never complained against him about anything. However, there were a number of complaints against the claimant regarding her performance and most of the time, RW1 mitigated for her.






22.
He contended that there were reports of the claimant being rude to farmers and abusing them; posting fictitious weights for members; issuing stocks without stock cards; and granting casual staff access to sensitive work and data.






23.
He contended that the claimant was always given her pay slips without which she would not have obtained loans from various institutions.






24.
He contended that the claimant was suspended for various reasons but the effort to complete her disciplinary process within 60 days stalled due to her theatrics. Her lawyer proposed a mutual separation arrangement but she declined to sign the agreement. She was then served with a show cause letter but she resigned and subsequently sued the respondent for alleged dismissal.






25.
He maintained that the claimant resigned to avoid disciplinary process and as such she is not entitled to any damages. Therefore, he prayed for the suit to be dismissed.






26.
On cross examination, RW2 confirmed that he became chairman of the respondent in 2009 and found claimant still working for the respondent. He stated that he was a member of respondent’s Management committee in 2013 when the claimant was promoted to the position of Senior Factory Manager by the former chairman.








Submissions


27.
It was submitted for the claimant that she was negatively discriminated against by being denied a chance to go on trips with other factory Managers; she was subjected to frequent and unreasonable transfers from one factory to another; her salary was intermittently paid and also, she was denied the attendant salary increments; she was promoted to senior factory manager but she was denied salary increase and the use of office facilities. In view of the foregoing matters, it was submitted that her resignation amounted to constructive dismissal. Reliance was placed on the case of Godfrey Allan Tolo v Tobias O.Otieno & another (2022) eKLR (Authority not availed to the court).






28.
It was further submitted that the payslips filed as evidence of payment were not genuine but tailor made to defeat the suit. It was submitted that all the said salary postings were done on 13
th
 December 2023(see page 58-65 of the respondent’s bundle of documents). Consequently, it was urged that the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought in her suit plus costs.






29.
On the other hand, it was submitted for the respondent that the alleged constructive dismissal does not arise. It was argued that the claimant was subjected to disciplinary process by the employer but she frustrated the same by her theatrics. At one time she proposed mutual separation but later refused to sign the separation agreement. Subsequently, the employer re-ignited the disciplinary process but the claimant served a resignation letter.






30.
It was submitted that the said resignation did not meet the requirements of a constructive dismissal. It was further submitted that the alleged unreasonable transfers were in fact normal and affected all the other factory managers; that she was paid salary regularly and was issued with pay slips which she used to apply loans; and that she has failed to produce her bank statements to disprove the said payment of salary.






31.
It was submitted that the claimant resigned to evade disciplinary process before being proved guilty of the misconduct allegations she was facing including fraud and falsification of cherry records among others. Consequently, it was submitted that the claimant is not entitled to the reliefs sought.






32.
It was further submitted that the claimant’s allegation that her basic salary was Kshs.13,000.00 is untrue since her pay slips indicated that Kshs.19,171 as her salary a confirmation that her salary was increased. It was argued that the claimant did not plead the specific terminal due she is seeking. Further that the claim for general damages is misplaced since she voluntarily resigned.






33.
It was submitted that the respondent did not create any working conditions that were intolerable to the claimant and as such there is no relief available to her for constructive dismissal. For emphasis reliance was placed on Enid Nkirote Mukire v Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board (2022) eKLR and 
Kenya Union of Sugarcane Plantation and Allied Workers v Othira (Appeal E005 of 2023
) (2024) KEELRC 843 (KLR) (18 April 2024) (Judgment).








Analysis and determination


34.
I have carefully considered the pleadings, evidence and submissions presented to the court by the two sides. The employment relationship between them is admitted. The resignation by the claimant is also admitted. The issues for determination are: -
a.
Whether the resignation amounts to constructive dismissal.
b.
Whether the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought.








Constructive dismissal


35.
Cambridge Dictionary defines constructive dismissal as: -
“
Actions taken by an employer that intentionally make working conditions for an employee difficult or unfair so that the employee feels forced to leave their job.”






36.
According to the Black’s Law Dictionary 9
th
 Edition, constructive termination means: -
“
A termination of employment brought about by the employer making the employee’s working condition so intolerable that the employee feels compelled to leave.”






37.
Constructive dismissal takes various forms including unilateral variation of the contract of employment; non-payment or delay in payment of salaries, indefinite suspension without pay, failure to assign duties, overworking, negative discrimination, and mistreatment such as verbal abuses. When the employer subjects his employee to the above conditions, the employee may resign or leave the employment without notice and sue for constructive dismissal because the resignation is not voluntary.






38.
In this case, the claimant contends that she was forced to resign by the intolerable working conditions including unreasonable and frequent transfers, intermittent payment of salary, prolonged suspension, negative discrimination and mistreatment by the Secretary Manager. The respondent denies all the allegations of intolerable working conditions and maintains that the claimant resigned voluntarily to evade disciplinary hearing.






39.
There is no dispute that the claimant was subjected to disciplinary hearing for various allegations of misconduct and negligent performance of duty. The process started with a suspension letter, two hearings were scheduled but the process was halted to allow negotiation for a mutual separation but the same also failed after claimant declined to sign the agreement.






40.
The suspension was vide letter dated 17
th
 July 2023 which cited the reasons but failed to state the duration of the suspension period. Under clause 15 of the CBA suspension period is capped at sixty (60) consecutive days on half pay. However, where the employee is facing criminal charges, the suspension is without pay. There is no evidence to show that the claimant’s suspension was lifted after the lapse of 60 days. According to her, she remained on suspension until the day she resigned vide the letter dated 14
th
 November 2023.






41.
In this case there is also evidence that salaries were paid intermittently if the payrolls filed by the respondent are anything to go by (see pay roll dated 25
th
 May 2023 and 11
th
 December 2023). It is therefore correct that throughout her suspension period, the claimant was not paid any salary.






42.
Having considered the foregoing evidence, I find that the claimant had a valid grievance against the respondent. She was subjected to a prolonged suspension and all her salary withheld. Although the issue of salary affected all the other employees, I have to say that two wrongs don’t make a right. The employee was entitled to resign due to the said breaches by the employer which fundamentally made the claimant unable to perform her obligations under the employment contract.






43.
In the case of Godfrey Allan Tolo, supra, the court held that;
“
For constructive dismissal to be inferred the employee must have resigned within a reasonable time from his employment with or without notice as a result of the employer’s hostile working conditions at his work place. The employer must also not have expressed the desire to terminate the employee.”






44.
In this case, employer had commenced disciplinary proceedings against the claimant but stalled to pursue an amicable separation. After the failure of the amicable settlement, the respondent revived the disciplinary proceedings and added a new accusation that the claimant had absented herself from work. That new accusation did not go down well with the claimant who had been out on suspension without pay for more than the required period of 60 days under the CBA.






45.
In this case, I am satisfied that failure to pay an employee salary for six consecutive months is one of the grounds upon which the court can infer constructive dismissal. The failure to pay salary had nothing to do with the disciplinary proceedings against the claimant.






46.
Besides, the failure to recall the claimant from suspension after the lapse of the maximum 60 days is also a good ground upon which constructive dismissal can be inferred especially when no salary was being paid. The suspension letter did not state the period of the suspension and therefore the claimant could not report back to work without being recalled in the same manner she was suspended. It is not correct for the employer to blame for the extended suspension on allegation that she proposed mutual separation. The problem started before that time because, as I have observed, the suspension letter was not specific on the period of the suspension.






47.
As regards the general hostility by the Secretary Manager, RW1 denied the same and no independent witness was called by the claimant. In any event, there is evidence that the transfers of factory managers was done across board and did not affect the claimant alone. Consequently, I find that the only two reasons why the resignation of the claimant became constructive dismissal were the prolonged suspension beyond the maximum 60 days and the failure to pay her salary for over six months. Even if the salary was paid, the same was paid after the resignation.








Reliefs sought


48.
In view of the above matters, I hold that the claimant is entitled to the declaration that the respondent’s actions amounted to her constructive dismissal from the date she resigned. It is also obvious that by the said actions the claimant’s rights under the contract of employment and statutes were violated and therefore she is entitled to damages for unlawful dismissal by dint of Section 49 of the 
Employment Act
, 2007.






49.
The claimant worked for 24 years before the separation. The court notes that she had performance and disciplinary issues although not proved. At her age, she may not be able to secure another job. Having considered all the foregoing issues, I award her twelve (12) months gross salary for unlawful termination. Based on the pay slip for October 2023, I award her Kshs.27,010 x 12 =Kshs.324,120.00.






50.
The claimant has urged the court to compel the respondent to pay her commensurate salary increments due to her from 2013 when she was promoted to Senior Factory Manager. However, the basis for such a request has not been demonstrated. However, I note that the respondent has demonstrated that the claimant’s basic salary was increased from Kshs.13,000 to Kshs.19,174 as at October 2023. Consequently, the said prayer is declined.






51.
There is also a prayer for terminal dues and service. The claim is not quantified but I note from Clause 18 of the CBA that the claimant is entitled to terminal benefits. Therefore, I direct the respondent to compute the terminal dues payable to the claimant based on Clause 18 of the CBA and file report in court for adoption within 30 days of this judgment.








Conclusion


52.
I have found that the claimant has proved a case of constructive dismissal against the respondent and awarded her Kshs.324,120.00 as compensation for the unlawful dismissal. I have also awarded terminal dues for her 24 years of service under Clause 18 of the CBA. Consequently, I now enter judgment for the claimant against the respondent as follows: -
a.
Declaration that the respondent has constructively dismissed the claimant.
b.
Award of Kshs.324,120.00 for the unlawful dismissal.
c.
Terminal dues under clause 18 of the CBA.
d.
Costs and interest at court rates from the date of this judgment.
e.
The award is subject to statutory deductions.

Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellants instituted suit vide a plaint dated 10
th
 June 2019 in which they sought general damages under the 
Law Reform Act
 and Fatal Accident Act as well as special damages, interest on the same and costs of the suit.






2.
The appellants’ case was that on or about the 26
th
 July 2017, the deceased, a lawful walking pedestrian, who was walking along the Kisumu –Busia road when at Yala township area the respondent’s driver so negligently and recklessly drove, managed and or controlled motor vehicle registration number KBL 869G Mitsubishi Lancer that he lost control of the said vehicle thereby causing an accident that resulted in the deceased’s fatal injuries.






3.
The respondent entered appearance and filed its defence dated 14
th
 November 2021 in which it denied being the appellants’ claims putting them to strict proof and instead blamed the deceased for negligence leading up to the alleged accident.






4.
The respondent never took part in the trial despite notice of the hearing. In her judgement, the trial magistrate found that based on the evidence on record, which was not controverted, the respondent was 100% liable for causing the accident.






5.
The trial magistrate awarded the appellants quantum of damages as follows: Pain & Suffering – Kshs. 10,000, Loss of expectation of life – Kshs. 100,000 and Loss of dependency – Kshs. 438,188 bringing it to a total of Kshs. 548,188. The trial magistrate however deducted the award for loss of expectation of life giving the appellants a total award of Kshs. 448,188 as the appellants failed to prove special damages. The trial magistrate further awarded the appellants interest on the award at court rates from the date of judgement till payment in full.






6.
Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellants filed a memorandum of appeal dated 3
rd
 November 2023 on the quantum awarded by the trial court raising the following grounds of appeal;
a.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in making an award in respect of pain and suffering thereby arriving at ana erroneously low award.
b.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in making awards for loss of expectation of life and loss of dependency thereby arriving at an erroneously low award.
c.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to make an award for special damages.
d.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in making a deduction of the award under loss of expectation of life from the total sum of general and special damages awarded.
e.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider the appellants’ submissions thereby arriving at an erroneous and low award in respect of general and special damages.
f.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to completely evaluate the appellants’ evidence on general damages and special damages.
g.
That the award by the learned trial magistrate on general and special damages goes against established and prevailing judicial precedents.






7.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions however the respondent did not take part in the suit nor file any submissions.








The Appellant’s Submissions


8.
The appellant submitted that on the award under pain and suffering, had the trial magistrate appreciated the evidence and submissions presented then she would have made a higher award under this head. It was submitted that the award of Kshs. 10,000 which was too low and that the same should be enhanced to Kshs. 50,000. Reliance was placed on the case of Acceler Global Logistics v Gladys Nasambu Waswa & Another [2020] eKLR and that of Sukari Industries Limited v Clyde Machimbo Juma, Homa Bay HCCA No. 68 of 2015 [2016] eKLR where an award of Kshs. 50,000 was awarded under this head.






9.
It was submitted that the trial court erred in its award of loss of expectation of life of Kshs. 100,000 and that the same ought to be enhanced to Kshs. 300,000 as was upheld in the case of Letayoro & Another v JK (Suing as the Legal Representative of the Estate of the CK(Deceased) Civil Appeal 13 of 2020 [2022] KEHC 10309 (KLR) (28 June 2022) (Judgement) as well as the case of Daniel Kuria Nganga v Nairobi City Council [2013] eKLR where Kshs. 300,000 was awarded on the same head.






10.
On loss of dependency it was submitted that in the absence of the parameters necessary to adopt the multiplier approach, a global award would have been the best in the circumstances as was held in the case of Mary Khayesi Awalo & Another v Mwilu Malungu & Another ELD HCCC No. 19 of 1997 [1999] eKLR.






11.
It was submitted that in adopting the multiplier approach and basing it on salary that was not supported by evidence on record, the trial court failed to take cognisance of the fact that the deceased was 78 years at the time of his death, well beyond retirement age thus rendering the multiplier approach unsuitable and had no anchor in law.






12.
The appellants thus submitted that an award of Kshs. 700,000 ought to have been made under this award. Reliance was placed on the case of Samuel Nyoro & Another v Joyce Wanjiku & Another (Suing as legal representative of the Estate of Kamau Muturi [Deceased] 2020 eKLR where a global award of Kshs. 600,000 was upheld where the deceased was 74 years old.






13.
It was submitted that the trial court erred in law in deducting the award of loss of expectation of life from the sum total of awards made under pain and suffering as was held by the Court of Appeal in the cases of Kemfro Africa Limited t/a “Meru Express Services [1976]” & Another v Lubia & Another (No. 2) [1978] KLR 30 and Hellen Waruguru Waweru (Suing as the Legal representative of Pete Waweru Mwenja [Deceased] v Kiarie Shoe Stores Limited [2015] eKLR.






14.
On special damages it was submitted that the same was specifically pleaded and proved and that the trial court erroneously disregarded the foregoing.








Analysis and Determination


15.
This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and make its own conclusions. It must, however, keep at the back of its mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand. In Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR, the court stated as follows-
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






16.
In that regard, an appellate court will only interfere with the judgment of the lower court, if the said decision is founded on wrong legal principles. That was the holding of the Court of Appeal in Mkube v Nyamuro [1983] LLR at 403, where Kneller JA & Hancox Ag JJA held that-
“
A Court on appeal will not normally interfere with the finding of fact by a trial court unless it is based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the judge is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching his conclusion.”






17.
In the instant case, the liability is not contested. The only issue for consideration is whether the award of general and special damages was inordinately low as to warrant this court’s interference.






18.
In Kemfro Africa Limited T/A Meru Express Services & Gathongo Kanini v A.M. Lubia & Olive Lubia (1982-88) I KAR 727 at page 730, Kneller J.A. stated:
“
The principles to be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the quantum of damages awarded by a trial judge were held by the former Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa to be that it must be satisfied that either the judge, in assessing the damages took into account an irrelevant factor, or left out of account a relevant one or that; short of this, the amount is so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. See Ilango V Manyoka [1967] E.A. 705, 709, 713; Lukenya Ranching and Farming Cooperative Society Limited Vs Kalovoto [1970] E.A. 414, 418, 419. This court follows the same principles.”






19.
The principles espoused in the above Court of Appeal decision have stood the test of time and continue to be applied by all appellate courts.






20.
In the case of P. J. Dave Flowers Ltd v David Simiyu Wamalwa Civil Appeal No. 6 of 2017 [2018] eKLR rendered itself on the matter of assessment of quantum as below:
“
… it is generally accepted from the laid down legal principles on assessment of quantum that personal injuries are difficult to assess with precision and accuracy so as to satisfy the claimant. The courts discretion has been left to individual judges to exercise judicious in respect of the circumstances of each specific case. The sum total of the evidence and the medical reports positive findings will form part of the consideration in the award of damages. The trial court will also be expected to apply the principles in various case law and authorities decided by the superior courts on the matter.”








Damages Under the Law Reforms Act


Pain and Suffering


21.
Damages for pain and suffering are recoverable by the estate of a deceased person as compensation for the pain suffered before death which results from an accident. In Sukari Industries Limited v Clyde Machimbo Juma [2016] eKLR, Majanja J. observed thus:
“
…it is natural that any person who suffers injury as a result of an accident will suffer some form of pain. The pain may be brief and fleeting but it is nevertheless pain for which the deceased’s estate is entitled to compensation. The generally accepted principle is that nominal damages will be awarded on this head for death occurring immediately after the accident. Higher damages will be awarded if the pain and suffering is prolonged before death.”






22.
In the instant case, PW2 was the only eye witness to the accident. He adopted his testimony filed in court on the 14th September 2021. PW2 testified that the deceased was hit by a car that was speeding. From his testimony, it was evident that the deceased died instantly. PW1 the deceased’s wife also testified that she received information that the deceased had been hit by a car and died on the spot.






23.
Given that the sums awardable under this head have ranged from Kshs 10,000/- to Kshs 100,000/- from past precedents, the sum of Kshs 10,000/- awarded by the trial court is not inordinately low or unreasonable as to warrant interference. See Sukari Industries Limited supra. I therefore decline to upset it.










Loss of Expectation of Life


24.
The conventional award for loss of expectation of life is Kshs 100,000/=, see the case of Hyder Nthenya Musili & another v China Wu Yi Limited & another [2017] eKLR. The trial magistrate’s award of Kshs 100,000/- is therefore not so unreasonable as to present an erroneously low estimate. It is thus upheld.








Damages Under the 
Fatal Accidents Act


Loss of dependency


25.
The evidence presented before the trial court that was not controverted was that the deceased was aged 78 years old, married and had been survived by 3 sons and 1 daughter, a total of 4 children. PW1 further testified that the deceased was a farmer who used to provide for his family and even pay school fees for his children. There was no evidence of the deceased’s earnings produced before court.






26.
The trial court in its calculation of quantum under this head used the multiplier approach being guided by the minimum wage of an unskilled employee as an employee. In their submissions, the appellants faulted the trial courts use of the multiplier approach on the grounds that the same was not based on any evidence presented before court.






27.
In Mwanzia v Ngalali Mutua Kenya Bus Ltd cited in Albert Odawa v Gichumu Githenji Nku Hcca No.15 of 2003 [2007] eKLR, the court made the following observation;
“
The multiplier approach is just a method of assessing damages. It is not a principle of law or a dogma. It can, and must be abandoned, where the facts do not facilitate its application. It is plain that it is a useful and practical method where factors such as the age of the deceased, the amount of annual or monthly dependency and the expected length of the dependency are known or are knowable without undue speculation; where that is not possible, to insist on the multiplier approach would be to sacrifice justice on the altar of methodology, something a Court of Justice should never do.”






28.
In the same breath, the court in Moses Mairua Muchiri v Cyrus Maina Macharia (Suing as the personal representative of the estate of Mercy Nzula Maina (deceased) [2016] eKLR, held as follows-
“
It has been held elsewhere that where it is not possible to ascertain the multiplicand accurately, as appears to have been the case here, courts should not be overly obsessed with mathematical calculations in order to make an award under the head of lost years or loss of dependency. If the multiplicand cannot be ascertained with any precision, courts can make a global award, which by no means is a standard or conventional figure but is an award that will always be subject to the circumstances of each particular case.”






29.
In Frankline Kimathi Maariu & another v Philip Akungu Mitu Mborothi (suing as administrator and personal representative of Antony Mwiti Gakungu deceased [2020] eKLR where the court was dealing with a similar issue, it stated:
“
(23). In the present case, there was no satisfactory proof of the monthly income. Where there is no salary proved or employment, the Court should be wary into subscribing to a figure so as to come up with a probable sum to be used as a multiplicand. In such circumstances, it is advisable to apply the global sum approach or the minimum wage as the appropriate mode of assessing the loss of dependency.
[24]. The global sum would be an estimate informed by the special circumstances of each case. It will differ from case to case but should not be arbitrary. It should be seen to be a suitable replacement that correctly fits the gap.”






30.
From the above, it is clear, therefore, that the choice of whether to adopt a multiplier or a global award approach is entirely a matter of discretion of the court, but of course, as dictated by the circumstances of the case.






31.
In the present case, it is my opinion that the circumstances of the case warranted that the trial magistrate use the global approach in calculating award for loss of dependency. This is because there was no evidence of specific earnings by the deceased, even from his alleged farming activities which were not stated to be on commercial or just subsistence farming. The trial court thus erred in law and fact in using the multiplier method in arriving at loss of dependency. Taking into consideration the aforementioned, I am satisfied that this is a case where it is more appropriate to adopt the global award approach and I thus proceed to do so.






32.
The appellants proposed a global award of Kshs. 700,000 for loss of dependency.






33.
In the case of Antony Njoroge Ng’ang’a (Legal representative of the Estate of the late Fred Nganga Njoroge aka Fred Ng’ang’a Njoroge) v James Kinyanjui Mwangi & 2 others [2022] eKLR the appellate court awarded the deceased’s representative Kshs. 400,000 for loss of dependency where the deceased was 64 years old.






34.
In the case of Samuel Nyoro & another v Joyce Wanjiku Kamau & another (Suing as Legal Representatives of Estate of Kamau Muturi (Deceased) [2020] eKLR where the deceased was 78 years old, the appellate court upheld the lower court’s award of Kshs. 600,000 for loss of dependency.






35.
Accordingly, taking into consideration the circumstances of this case as well as acknowledging the recent awards made in the Samwel Nyoro Case (supra) and the effects of inflation, it is my view that a global award of Kshs. 650,000 is a reasonable one. I award the same under this head.










Whether the award for loss of dependency ought to be reduced by the amount awarded for loss of expectation of life.


36.
The trial court in its final calculation for the award of quantum deducted the award for loss of dependency ought to be reduced by the amount awarded for loss of expectation of life. The appellants have argued that the same was an error of fact and law on the part of the trial magistrate.






37.
In the case of Hellen Waruguru Waweru (Suing as the legal representative of Peter Waweru Mwenja (Deceased) v Kiarie Shoe Stores Limited [2015] eKLR it was held interalia that there is no legal requirement for the court to deduct the amount awarded under the 
Law Reform Act
 from the award made under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
.






38.
In my view, the issue of double compensation does not arise because the two statutes independently provide for award of damages. This was the view taken by the Court of Appeal in Silverstone Quarry Limited & another v Beatrice Mukulu Kang’uta & another (suing as Administrators of the Estate of Philip Musyoka Muthoka [2020] eKLR.






39.
accordingly, I find and hold that the deduction was unjustified. I set it aside.








Special damages


40.
The trial court declined to grant the appellants special damages on the grounds that the same had not been proven and this was faulted by the appellant who submitted that they specifically pleaded and provided receipts of the special damages claimed.






41.
It is trite that special damages have to be specifically pleaded and proven. In the instant case, special damages were specifically pleaded in paragraph 10 of the plaint dated 10
th
 June 2019 and proven through the production of receipts. I shall thus award the appellants special damages of Kshs. 44,200.






42.
The upshot of all the above is that this appeal is partially successful to the extent that the trial court’s award vide its judgement dated 19
th
 October 2023 is set aside and substituted with the following awards on quantum of damages under each head:
Loss of dependency ……………………………. Kshs. 650,000
Pain & Suffering ………………………………. Kshs. 10,000
Loss of expectation of life …………………….. ..Kshs. 100,000
Proved Special Damages………………………....Kshs. 44,200
Total Kshs. 804,200






43.
Each parry shall bear their own costs of the appeal as the respondent did not contest the appeal and the appeal is only partially successful.

Ruling










1.
This ruling relates to the applicant’s Notice of Motion dated 15
th
 March 2024, brought under section 89 of the Public Service Commission (PSC) Act and section 12 (3) (VIII) of the Employment and Labour Relations Court (ELRC) Act. It seeks the following reliefs: -
a.
The motion herein be certified urgent and an inter-partes hearing date be allocated on priority basis on account of urgency.
b.
That the decision of the Public Service Commission made vide letter dated 14
th
 April, 2021 reinstating into service the Applicant without loss of benefits and payment of all outstanding emoluments be recognized, adopted and enforced as a judgment of the court and a decree to issue forthwith.
c.
Costs of this Application and interest thereon be provided for.
d.
Any other and further relief that this Honorable Court may deem fit and just to grant.






2.
The motion is premised on the grounds set out in its body and the Supporting Affidavit sworn on 15
th
 March 2024. Basically, the applicant’s case is that he was dismissed from employment by the respondents and appealed against the said decision before the Interested Party.






3.
The respondents have opposed the motion vide Replying Affidavit sworn on 20
th
 May 2024 by the respondent’s County Attorney, Ms Carolyne Kinyua. In brief, the respondents’ case is that the applicant was lawfully dismissed for participating in an illegal strike and failing to participate in disciplinary hearing. Further that the appeal to the commission was filed out of time and the ensuing decision is incapable of being enforced/implemented. Besides the appeal was never served on the respondents and therefore they were condemned unheard.






4.
The material before me shows that the Interested Party (PSC) considered the appeal and made the following decision: -
“
Commission decision.
The Commission found the appeal meritorious and therefore decided that it be allowed as Mr.Murimi availed evidence confirming that he has been working and no rebuttal has been given to challenge his claim.”






5.
Section 89 (1) of the 
Public Service Commission Act
 provides that: -
“
Any person who is affected by the decision of the Commission made under this part may file the decision for enforcement by the Employment and Labour Relations Court provided for under Article 162 (2) (a) of 
the Constitution
.”






6.
The essence of the above provision is that a party affected by the decision of the PSC in relation to an appeal under section 77 of the County Government Act, may file the decision before the ELRC and have it enforced as a decree of the court. Such provision does not give the court discretion to accept or reject, neither does it give the court any power to enrich the decision nor return it to the Commission.






7.
In my view, the law is deficient to that extent and I recommend for amendment to clarify the extent of the court’s powers, when faced with a decision like the one before me. Can a party who finds the decision by commission deficient, ask the court to make orders which are not contained in the decision by the Commission?






8.
My view is that, the court cannot travel outside the four corners of the decision by the Commission. Doing so would be reviewing the decision or sitting on appeal over the decision without jurisdiction.






9.
Having said that, I must hold that section 89 of the PSC Act does not leave any chance for litigation over the decision by the commission. The process is non-litigious and all what the court is supposed to do is to receive the decision and enforce it as if it were its own decision.






10.
The applicant has attached as “Exhibit NM8” to the application, copy of the appeal dated 18
th
 September 2020. The copy is illegible to a great extent but in the last paragraph the applicant requests the commission to rescind the decision by the respondents. The Commission allowed the appeal.






11.
In line with the provisions of section 89 of the PSC Act, I adopt the decision of the Commission dated 14
th
 April, 2021 for enforcement as a decree of this court. A decree to be drawn as per the decision adopted. Each party shall bear its own costs.

Judgment










1.
This Judgement relates to only one issue. The rent payable on Title NO. MASII MITHINI/143. But before we come to the determination of the same, we need to highlight the long and checkered history of the matter. It started with the Tenants’ reference dated 7/4/2021. The same together with the notice of motion application of even date were founded on section 12(4) of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) ACT
 (Cap 301) hereinafter “the Act”






2.
The Tenats namely Judy Mwelu and Silvester Karissa grieved that the 1st and 2nd Respondents were denying them quiet possession of the demised premises and had also arbitrarily increased the rent payable on the premises from Kshs 10,000/= to Kshs 20,000/= following the process of the law.






3.
It is important to note that Silvester Karissa, the purported 2nd Tenant and Peter Matheka the purported 1st Respondent remained Tenant and Landlord at large respectively and there was no mention of the two during the entire proceedings though their names kept appearing in the pleadings.






4.
By an order made on the 2/12/2024 by Hon. A. Muma, the Respondents were restrained from increasing the rent payable from Kshs 10,000/= to Kshs 20,000/= pending the hearing and determination of the reference. The Respondents were also restrained from interfering with he Tenants’ quiet possession of the demised premises.






5.
This matter took a different turn when there was filed the notice of motion dated 25/7/2022.The applicants were Lucia Ndululu Kimithi, Nzivo Muia Kimithi, Stellamaris Mbithe and Michael Kasio. Lucia and Nzivo are sister and brother to the 2nd respondent Lazarus Matheka whereas the 3rd & 4th interested parties are their niece and nephew.






6.
The four sought that they be enjoined as interested parties in these proceedings as they are sister, brother and children respectively to the owner of the title no. Masii/Mithini/143 namely Ruth Nzivulu Matheka and therefore with direct interest to the management of the demised premises and of the income being generated therefrom by way of rent.






7.
By an order issued by Hon A. Muma on the 27/7/2022, the applicants were enjoined in these proceedings as the 1st to 4th respondents/interested parties. The court was to later on the 27/1/2023 deliver a judgement that incorporated the reference and notice of motion application both dated the 7/4/2021 and the interested parties’ notice of motion application dated 25/7/2022.






8.
The import of the said judgement was that; -
(i)
Landlords allowed to vary the monthly rent payable to Kshs 20,000/= per month from February, 2023”.
(ii)
“The same shall be paid to the Tribunal in light of the succession cases ongoing or yet to be commenced more particular Masii/Mathini/143 where the suit premises is located”
(iii)
Parties to bear their own costs”






9.
The Tenants were however dissatisfied with the said judgement and filed the notice of motion application dated 56/2/2023. The motion sought for the following orders ;-
1)
Spent
2)
That this Honourable Court be pleased to review its Ruling delivered on the 27/1/2023
3)
That this Honourable Tribunal be pleased to stay, review and/or suspend the enforcement and/or execution of the ruling delivered on the 27/1/2023 and all consequential process arising therefrom pending the hearing and determination of this application
4)
That the tenant be allowed to pay rent at the old rate of Kshs 10,000/=per month pending succession proceedings
5)
That the costs of this case be provided for






10.
After the application was canvassed, Hon A. Muma delivered a Ruling on the 22/11/2023 and made the following orders;-
a)
I allow the Tenats’ application dated 6/2/2023. Tenants to continue paying rent at Kshs 10,000/= every month pending full hearing
b)
The Tenant to file a valuation report in 30 days
c)
Hearing for rent assessment on 24/1/2024
d)
Tenant’s Advocates at liberty to cease acting after service of hearing notice upon the Tenant and filing an affidavit of service
e)
Leave to appeal granted to the Landlords
f)
Thrown away costs assessed at Kshs 10,000/= in favour of the Landlords






11.
By directions issued by Hon. A. Muma on the 4/4/2024, this matter was ordered to be placed before Hon. Joyce Murigi, a Registered and Practicing Valuer and who sits in a panel with Hon. Ndegwa Wahome, MBS to rule on the rent payable on the demised premises by having due regard to the parties respective valuation reports.






12.
The Landlords valuation report is by M/S Quince Real Estate and it is dated 2/2/2024. That for the Tenants is by Proland Realtors Limited and is dated the 16/1/2024. Over and above the valuation reports, we found it desirable that the Valuers concerned testified and were cross examined on their respective reports.






13.
The Tenant’s Valuer Mr. Nicholas Kimathi testified on the 11/6/2024. He is a registered and practicing Valuer. He testified that in the valuation , he used the market rental comparison approach and fair market rent rates, On cross-examination, he claimed that his comparisons were not in the report but in his private notes. He proposed a rent of Kshs. 7,000/= per month and a maximum of Kshs 10,000/= in case the premises were renovated. The report was produced as exhibit No. 1.






14.
The Valuer for the Landlord M/S Linet Mwende Ngei testified on the 26/7/2024. She is a registered and practicing Valuer. Her report is dated 2/2/2022 under the firm name of Quince Real Estate. She said that she used the contractors method/cost approach of valuation. To her, there were no sufficient and/or enough premises for either market value or the comparable methods of valuation.






15.
However on cross examination, she indicated that she had also employed the comparable method to an extent and found that an Agrovet shop of the same size with the suit premises was charging rent at Kshs 40,000/= whereas a Butchery of the same size was charging Kshs 25,000/= in the year 2017. She however did not incorporate the comparables in her report.






16.
The witness produced a bundle of documents namely the valuation report, her certification as a Valuer, the certification of her employer Mr. Joseph Mwangi Mutiso as a Valuer, their gazettement in the Kenya Gazette as Valuers, a receipt on ownership of the plot from Machakos County Government dated 16/3/2021, the annual practicing certificates for herself and Joseph Mutiso Mwangi as exhibit no. 1.






17.
It was her evidence that the reasonable rent payable on the premises was Kshs 35,000/= inclusive of electricity, water and service charge.






18.
At the close of the hearing, both opted to rely on their pleadings already on record.






19.
The question of assessment of rent is a well beaten path with settled guidelines and principles on how to navigate the same. To start with, Section 9(2) of the Act provides that;- “without prejudice to the generality of this section, a Tribunal may upon any reference ;-
a.
Determine or vary the rent to be payable in respect of the controlled tenancy, having regard to the terms thereof and to the rent at which the premises concerned might reasonably be expected to be let in the open market and disregarding-
i.
any effect on rent of the fact that the tenant has, or his predecessors in title have, been in occupation of the premises
ii.
any goodwill attached to the premises by reason of the carrying as threat of the trade, business or obligation of the Tenant or any such predecessors
iii.
any effect on rent of any improvement carried out by the tenant or any such predecessor otherwise than pursuance of an obligation to the immediate landlord;
b.
Terminate or vary any of the terms or conditions of the controlled tenancy, or any of the rights or services enjoyed by the tenant, upon such conditions, if any, as it deems appropriate”






20.
Among the powers of this Tribunal includes addressing the question of rent variations and all matters related to rent payment. Section 12(1) (b) of the Act further defines some of the powers given to this court as follows;-
“
To determine or vary the rent to be payable in respect of any controlled tenancy, having regard to all the circumstances thereof”






21.
In determining this question, we also rely in the celebrated case of Tala Investment Ltd vs Green Spot Limited, Civil Appeal No 269 of 1993, Justice Shah as he then was, made the following holding;-
“
In dealing with principles upon which a Tribunal should act in assessing rent, its duty is to consider all reports properly before it. The Tribunal must go into individual comparables to decide which is a better report rather than merely arrive at a mean figure of the Landlord’s and the Tenant’s Valuer’s reports. That is not the proper criteria.”






22.
The proper criteria in assessment of rent was further provided in the court of appeal decision in the leading case of Cleaners Ltd v Barclays Bank & Co [1972] EA 188, the court of Appeal of East Africa held that;-
“
It is the reasonableness of the rent that must be in the forefront of the Tribunal’s investigations and determination. It must be the concern of this court too. The average rates per square foot or meter of a number of nearby buildings on the ground floor premises in which similar trades exercised are among other things relevant to assessing the rent that would reasonably be expected in the open market.”






23.
Though the tenant’s Valuer opted to use the comparison method of valuation, no comparisons were provided to help him reach the figures he did. It is therefore clear that the report thereof did not meet the market rental comparison methodology approach that they purported to employ






24.
On the other hand, the Landlord’s Valuer opted to employ the market value approach. She testified that the methodology looked at the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date. To her, the market dictated the rent of Kshs 35,000/= per month for the shop otherwise known as Masii Cyber Centre to be found on LR No. Masii/Mathini/143/ In our view, the Landlord’s report is a better report compared with that of the Tenant.






25.
However, before we adopt the said report in totality in assessing the rent payable, we have noted that, the respondents have not contested that they had intended to increase the rent payable on the premises at Kshs 20,000/= exclusive of taxes and service charge if at all.






26.
Though not an issue for determination in this judgement, we need to address the question of the purported termination of the tenancy herein as raised by the respondents. The respondents have continually complained that their notice to vacate by the letter dated 17/11/2020 was never considered. In our view, the said notice was illegal ab Initio. It was not in compliance with section 4 (2) of the Act.






27.
The section provides that;-
“
A Landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy, or alter, to the detriment of the tenant, any term or condition in, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under such tenancy, shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form”






28.
In our view, the sad letter dated 18/09/2020 (confirm correct date from the file) could not constitute a valid termination notice. The locus classicus case of Fredrick Mutua Mulinge T/A Kitui Uniform v Kitui Housing Co-operative Society Ltd [2017] eKLR addressed a similar situation and held as follows;-
“
It is clear from the foregoing authorities that the tenancy notice dated 28/6/2014 was null and void for failing to give the appellant two months notice as required under the Act and as such was of no legal effect. Life could not be breathed into the defective notice by the letter dated 1/7/2014 through which the respondent purported to amend the effective date of the notice. The letter was not a notice in the prescribed form provided by the ACT”.






29.
From a casual look, the purported termination notice, it is clear that the Landlord did not give the two (2) clear months envisaged by the law. The notice if it was in the proper form, it could only have taken effect in the 1/12/2020. Section 4(4) of the Act provides that;-
“
no tenancy notice shall take effect until such date, not being less than two months after the receipt thereof by the receiving party, as shall be specified therein”






30.
The purported notice of termination did not include the grounds under which the same was founded. This was contrary to the mandatory requirements of the section 7(1) of the Act. The section provides that;-
“
where under section 4 of this Act served a notice of termination of a controlled tenancy on the tenant, the grounds on which the landlord seeks to terminate such tenancy may be such of the following grounds as are stated in the aforesaid notice....”






31.
It is our respectful view then, that if the aforesaid notice of termination dated 18/09/2020 was under consideration, we would have dismissed the same without much ado.






32.
Having evaluated this matter in its totality including the averments by the interested parties herein, we are of the view that the justice of the matter speaks to each part.






33.
In the final analysis, and in view of the reason that no other order was sought to be reviewed from the judgement dated 27/1/2023, we make the following orders;-
1.
That the Tenants shall be allowed quiet possession of the demised premises known as Masii Cyber Centre as found on LR No. Masii/Mathini/143.
2.
That the rent for the demised premises is assessed at Kshs 20,000/= exclusive of any taxes or charges to be paid at the Tribunal before the 10th of each month in advance effective the 10/9/2024 until such time that the estate relating to Title No. Masii/Mathini/143 is completed.
3.
That each party shall bear own costs of the proceedings.
Those are the orders of the court.

Respondent







        
          (Being   an   appeal   against   the   whole   of   the   Judgement   of   the Honourable Mr. B. Mararo (SPM) delivered on 3rd  October 2023 in CMELRC Cause No. E016 of 2021 at Nanyuki)
        
      






Judgment










1.
By a Memorandum of Appeal dated 13
th
 October 2023, the Appellant impugned the aforementioned judgement on following grounds:
a.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact by denying the Respondent the opportunity of being heard and proceeded with the hearing of the cause despite the matter not being cause listed for the day.
b.
The Learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by denying the Respondent the right to cross examine the Claimant on his witness statement and oral evidence to verify the correctness of the same.
c.
The learned magistrate erred in law and fact by excluding the Respondent in the proceedings subsequent to the ex-parte hearing as no notice was served upon the Respondent for submissions or judgement yet the Respondent’s advocates were still on record.
d.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by awarding reliefs in form of notice pay and severance pay which reliefs are special damages claims and the amounts ought to have been specifically and proved.
e.
The learned magistrate erred in law and fact in awarding the Claimant notice pay of Kshs. 100,000/= without justification yet the net monthly salary as per contract was Kshs. 50,000/=.
f.
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by granting the Claimant severance pay despite the claimant having not pleaded and sought the said relief.
g.
The learned magistrate erred in law and fact by awarding the Claimant compensation of maximum 12 months’ salary without justification or explaining the reasons and contrary to the provisions of section 49(4) of the 
Employment Act
.
h.
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to order statutory deductions to be paid from the sums awarded to the Claimant.
i.
In all circumstances of the case, the finding of the learned magistrate are insupportable in law or on the basis of the evidence adduced.






2.
The Appellant urged the Court to allow the appeal, set aside the whole judgement and dismiss the respondent’s suit with cost and also award costs of the appeal.






Factual background


3.
The appellant employed the respondent as a Mechanic vide a contract dated 14
th
 August 2017 for a monthly salary of Kshs. 50,000 and he worked until he was retrenched vide the letter dated 31
st
 May 2019 due to low business. He filed suit in the lower court seeking declaration that the said retrenchment amounted to unfair and unlawful termination; salary in lieu of notice; general damages for unlawful termination of employment; terminal dues and benefits; and costs plus interest at court rate.






4.
The appellant filed a response admitting that it retrenched the respondent as alleged, and averred that it paid him one-month salary in lieu of notice amongst other terminal benefits. Consequently, it averred that the retrenchment was justified and a fair procedure was followed.






5.
During the trial, the respondent testified as PW1 and gave evidence which echoed the facts set out in the Statement of Claim and his written testimony. He tendered documentary evidence and oral evidence to demonstrate that; retrenchment was by a letter dated 31
st
 August 2019; there was no prior redundancy notice; and no payment was made to him in respect of salary, salary in lieu of notice, terminal benefits or at all.






6.
The appellant never tendered any evidence to support its pleadings and to rebut the evidence by the respondent and upon the consideration of the evidence presented, the trial (Hon Mararo SPM) found that the respondent had succeeded in proving that the appellant had terminated his employment unlawfully and unfairly. Further, the court awarded the respondent two months’ salary in lieu of notice, severance pay for two years, twelve months general damages for unfair and unlawful termination totaling to Kshs. 752,500 plus costs and interest.








Submissions in the appeal


7.
The Appellant’s Counsel filed written submissions dated 8
th
 May 2024. Grounds 1, 2, 3 & 9 were collapsed into one issue, the trial court erred by failing to grant the appellant an opportunity to be heard. It was submitted that the hearing date was taken ex-parte by the Respondent in Court on 28/03/2023, and service of the hearing notice upon the Appellant was not proved. Further that, there was no service of written submissions or notice of judgement upon the Appellant, and therefore it was excluded from participating in the proceedings. It was argued that had the Appellant been served with a notice of the hearing or subsequent notices, it would have recalled the Respondent for cross examination or filed its submissions.






8.
Grounds 4 and 6 of the appeal are about the award of salary in lieu of notice and severance pay ought not to be awarded because they were not specifically pleaded in the Statement of Claim. Reliance was placed on the case of Socfinaf Company Limited T/A Tatu Estate v Julius Ouma Okoth [2010’ eKLR, Nanyuki Water & Sewerage Company Limited v Benson Mwiti Ntiritu [2018] eKLR, Computer Revolution Africa Ltd v Anthony Mwai Munyi [2020] eKLR, Kenya Commercial Bank Limited vs Sheikh Osman Mohammed CA no. 179 of 2010 and Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & Another vs Stephen Mutinda Mule & 3 others [2014] eKLR where it was held that special damages should be specifically pleaded and further underscored the function of pleadings in adversarial litigation.






9.
As regards ground 5 of the appeal, it was argued that the Kshs. 100,000/= was erroneous as it was equivalent to 2 months yet section 35 (1) (c) of the 
Employment Act
 provides for issuance of 28 days’ termination notice by either party. Consequently, since there was no contract indicating a longer notice period, it was submitted that the award of two months instead of one-month salary was unjustified.






10.
Ground 7, reliance is about maximum compensation for unfair termination under section 49 of 
Employment Act
. It was argued that the Court ought to have considered the length of service and the opportunities available for the employee to secure comparable and suitable employment to justify the maximum award as required under subsection (4). Reliance was also placed on the case of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation v Geoffrey Wakio [2019] eKLR.






11.
Ground 8 of the appeal reliance was placed on section 49 (2) of the Act that provides for statutory deductions on awards made. Reliance was also placed on the case of Kioko Joseph suing as the legal representative of the Estate of Joseph Kilinda) v Bamburi Cement Ltd [2017] eKLR to argue that the court erred in not ordering statutory deductions on the awards. The Court was therefore urged to allow the appeal, set aside the judgement and dismiss the Respondent’s suit with costs.






12.
On the other hand, it was submitted for the Respondent that the Appellant was afforded a chance to be heard as its advocates were served hearing notice vide email dated 5
th
 April 2023 and an affidavit of service is on record.






13.
As regards grounds 4, 5, & 6 on salary in lieu of notice and severance pay, it was submitted that the Court arrived at the same after the court’s declaration that the termination was unfair and unlawful. Further that the salary in lieu of notice the computation in accordance with section 49. Reliance was placed on the cases of Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA page 93 and Gicheru v Morton and Another [2005] 2KLR 333 where the courts held that an appellate court would not normally interfere with an award of damages.






14.
as for ground 7, it was submitted that the maximum compensation of twelve months’ salary for unfair termination was in accordance with section 49 (1)(c) after the court exercised its discretion. Reliance was placed on the case of Kemfro Africa Limited T/A Meru Express Services [1976] & Anor vs Lubia & Another No. 2 [1987] KLR 30 and Catholic Diocese of Kisumu vs Sophia Achieng Tete Civil Appeal No. 284 of 2001 [2004] 2 KLR 55 to argue that the assessment of general damages is at the discretion of the trial court and an appellate Court is not justified to interfere with the same unless it is satisfied that the trial Court proceeded on wrong principles of the law or misapprehended the evidence and so arrived at a figure that is manifestly too high or too little.






15.
Grounds 8 is on the failure to subject the award in the impugned judgment to statutory deductions and it was submitted that section 49 (2) of the Act provides in mandatory terms that awards shall be subjected to statutory deductions, with or without a court order to that effect.






16.
Finally, the court was urged to seek guidance from the cases of Selle & Another v Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd & others and Peters v Sunday Post Limited on the mandate of a court in a first appeal court ought, that is, to, consider the law, pleadings and re-evaluate the evidence before the trial court. In the instant case the Court was urged to find no merits in the appeal and dismiss it with costs.








Analysis and determination


17.
The mandate of this court on a first appeal was enunciated in Selle v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd (1968) EA 123 the Court of Appeal held that: -
“
The appellate court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from a trial by the High Court is by way of a retrial and the principles upon which the Court of Appeal acts are that the court must consider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, the court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial Judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate he evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






18.
Being guided by the foregoing authority, I have carefully perused the Record of appeal and the rival submissions. The following issues fall for determination:
a.
Whether the Appellant was condemned unheard.
b.
Whether the retrenchment of the respondent amounted to unfair and unlawful termination.
c.
Whether this Court should disturb the award of damages by the trial Court.








Whether the Appellant was condemned unheard


19.
The Appellant’s argument was that the matter proceeded without its counsel’s knowledge and thereby it was denied a chance to cross examine the Respondent to verify the correctness of his claim. The Appellant contended that there was no affidavit of service on record to prove service upon it. However, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant was well aware of the hearing date as its counsel was served with a hearing notice on 5
th
 April 2023 via email and and Affidavit of Service was filed in Nanyuki Law Courts on 6
th
 April 2023.






20.
There is no denial that the matter was fixed for hearing on the 13/6/2023 and the appellant did not attend the hearing. The trial court satisfied itself that the appellant was aware of the hearing and allowed the respondent to prosecute his case. The appellant never followed up the matter until judgment was delivered on 3
rd
 October 2023. It is therefore an afterthought to raise the matter in the appeal without applying for review of the judgment. The decision to hear the matter in the absence of the appellant was made in June 2023 and therefore the right of appeal against the same lapsed before the impugned judgment was delivered. My conclusion is therefore that the appellant was given an opportunity of being heard before trial court but it deliberately failed to participate in the hearing.








Unfair and unlawful termination


21.
Section 45 (1) & (2) of the 
Employment Act
 provides that: -
”(1)
No employer shall terminate the employment of an employee unfairly.
(2)
A termination of employment by an employer is unfair if the employer fails to prove:
(a)
that the reason for the termination is valid;
(b)
that the reason for the termination is a fair reason—
i.
related to the employee’s conduct, capacity or compatibility; or
(ii)
based on the operational requirements of the employer; and
(c)
that the employment was terminated in accordance with fair procedure.”






22.
In this case, the termination was on account of redundancy and therefore, the employee was not to blame for any wrong doing. Redundancy is defined in section 2 of the 
Employment Act
 as:
”redundancy means the loss of employment, occupation, job or career by involuntary means through no fault of an employee, involving termination of employment at the initiative of the employer, where the services of an employee are superfluous and the practices commonly known as abolition of office, job or occupation and loss of employment;”






23.
In the instant appeal, the question at hand is whether the redundancy was done in accordance with the mandatory procedure set out under Section 40 of the Act provides as follows:
“
40.
Termination on account of redundancy
1.
An employer shall not terminate a contract of service on account of redundancy unless the employer complies with the following conditions—
a.
where the employee is a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the union to which the employee is a member and the labour officer in charge of the area where the employee is employed of the reasons for, and the extent of, the intended redundancy not less than a month prior to the date of the intended date of termination on account of redundancy;
b.
where an employee is not a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the employee personally in writing and the labour officer;
c.
the employer has, in the selection of employees to be declared redundant had due regard to seniority in time and to the skill, ability and reliability of each employee of the particular class of employees affected by the redundancy;
d.
where there is in existence a collective agreement between an employer and a trade union setting out terminal benefits payable upon redundancy; the employer has not placed the employee at a disadvantage for being or not being a member of the trade union;
e.
the employer has where leave is due to an employee who is declared redundant, paid off the leave in cash;
f.
the employer has paid an employee declared redundant not less than one month’s notice or one month’s wages in lieu of notice; and
g.
the employer has paid to an employee declared redundant severance pay at the rate of not less than fifteen days’ pay for each completed year of service.”  Emphasis added.






24.
Having considered the evidence on record, it is clear that the above procedure was not adhered to before laying off the respondent. First, he was not served with prior notice of at least one month and the area labour officer was also not served with the notice of the intended redundancy. Second, the appellant did not demonstrate that it undertook fair selection before the respondent was retrenched. Third, the respondent did not pay the respondent salary in lieu of notice, severance pay plus other accrued dues as required under the above provision. Consequently, I find that the retrenchment of the respondent amounted to unfair and unlawful termination of his employment and the trial court was right in arriving at the same conclusion.








Whether this Court should disturb the award of damages by the trial Court


25.
Whether or not an award of damages is to be disturbed on appeal, I am guided by the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Butt v Khan [1978] eKLR, thus:
“
An appellate court will not disturb an award of damages unless it is so inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate. It must be shown that the judge proceeded on wrong principles, or that he misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low.”






26.
Starting with the award of 12 months salary as compensation for unfair termination, the appellant faulted the trial court for not giving any justification for awarding the maximum award under section 49 (1) (c) of the 
Employment Act
. The respondent contended that the trial court was convinced that the award was deserving.






27.
Section 49(4) of the Act provides that:
“
A labour officer shall, in deciding whether to recommend the remedies specified in subsection (1) and (3), take into account any or all of the following-
a.
…”






28.
The above provision requires trial court to justify the award. In this case, the trial court applied the wrong principles of law in assessing the maximum award of 12 months’ salary compensation by failing to take into account any of the factors set out in above provisions. The Court, while exercising its discretion failed to consider the relevant factors set out in section 49 (4) (e), (f), (g) and (h) of the Act which include:
e.
“the employee’s length of service with the employer;
f.
the reasonable expectation of the employee as to the length of time for which his employment with that employer might have continued but for the termination;
g.
the opportunities available to the employee for securing comparable or suitable employment with another employer;
h.
the value of any severance payable by law”






29.
As a result of the failure to take into account the above relevant factors, the award made was manifestly excess. The respondent served for only two years as a Mechanic and he never tendered any evidence to demonstrate that it wasn’t possible to secure an alternative job. He was also entitled to payment of severance pay under section 40 of the Act. Having considered the foregoing factors and the fact that he did not contribute to the termination through misconduct, I am satisfied that an award six (6) months gross salary as compensation for unfair and unlawful termination equaling to Kshs. 300,000 is reasonable.






30.
I gather support from OlPejeta Ranching Limited vs. David Wanjau Muhoro [2017] eKLR, where the Court of Appeal held as follows:
“
The compensation awarded to the respondent under this head was the maximum awardable, that is to say, 12 months’ pay. The trial judge did not at all attempt to justify or explain why the respondent was entitled to the maximum award. Yes, the trial Judge may have been exercising discretion in making the award. However, such exercise should not be capricious or whimsical. It should be exercised on some sound judicial principles. We would have expected the Judge to exercise such discretion based on the aforesaid parameters. In the absence of any reasons justifying the maximum award, we are inclined to believe that the trial Judge in considering the award took into account irrelevant considerations and or failed to take into account relevant considerations, which act then invites our intervention.”






31.
As regards the award of Kshs. 100,000 as salary in lieu of notice, there is no evidence on record to justify the said award which was equivalent to two months salary. Even though the Respondent argued that it was in addition to the month’s salary that was not paid before termination, there was no evidence tendered to that extent. Section 40 (a) and (b) of the Act prescribes the conditions for redundancy including the following:
“
(f)
the employer has paid an employee declared redundant not less than one month’s notice or one month’s wages in lieu of notice; “






32.
In view of the foregoing provisions and the evidence, I find that the correct award is one-month salary being Kshs.50,000 and not Kshs. 100,000 which was not supported by evidence.






33.
As regards the award of severance pay, section 40 (1) (g) requires the employer to pay a retrenched employee, thus:
“
(g)
the employer has paid to an employee declared redundant severance pay at the rate of not less than fifteen days pay for each completed year of service.”






34.
In this case the respondent worked for two consecutive years which entitled him to severance pay for 30 days equaling to Kshs. 50,000. Consequently, I find that the trial court was right in awarding Kshs 50,000 as severance pay.






35.
Finally, I agree with the appellant that an award made under section 49 of the 
Employment Act
 ought to be subjected to statutory deductions. Consequently, I find that the trial court erred by failing to subject the decreed sum to statutory deductions.








Conclusion


36.
I have found that the appellant was not denied an opportunity to be heard in the primary suit, since he was served with a hearing notice and deliberately failed to attend the hearing. I have further found that the impugned judgment ought to be disturbed for the reason that the court applied the wrong principles of law ( failed to take into account relevant factors), and for being unsupported by evidence. Consequently, I enter judgment as follows:
a.
The appeal is partially successful
b.
The appellant is ordered to pay the respondent the following:
i.
Notice Kshs. 50,000.00
ii.
Compensation Kshs. 300,000.00
iii.
Severance pay Kshs. 50,000.00
Kshs.400,000.00
c.
Each party to bear costs of the appeal but the award of costs in the court below remains undisturbed.
d.
Interest at court rate from the date of the impugned judgment.
e.
The award of damages is subject to statutory deduction.

          ((An appeal arising out of the Judgment & Decree of the Honourable G.C. Serem in the Small Claims Court at Kisumu delivered on the 22nd June 2023 in Kisumu SCCOMM No. E193 of 2023))
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellant was sued by the respondent vide a statement of claim dated 11.4.2023 in which the respondent prayed for judgement in the sum of Kshs. 100,000 which amounts were monies allegedly advanced to the appellant on or about the 20.9.2022 vide a contract signed on the even date.






2.
The respondent in her statement of claim averred that she had entered into an agreement with the appellant wherein she advanced the appellant a loan of Kshs. 50,000 which money was to be paid on or before the 20th October 2022 and further that the amount advanced would bear interest at the rate of 20% per fortnight from the date of the agreement and thus the amount to be paid by the appellant was Kshs. 70,000 on or before 20th October 2022 and stood at Kshs. 100,000 at the time of filing of the claim.






3.
The appellant filed her response on the 5.7.2023 in which she denied signing the said agreement; that the said funds were not disbursed and further stating that the said agreement was not registered in accordance with section 5 of the Chattels Transfer Act and that therefore non-existent for lack of notice under sections 4, 6 and 16 of the Chattels Transfer Act.






4.
The matter proceeded under section 30 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 and parties proceeded to file submissions.






5.
The trial court found that there was a valid agreement between the parties by which both parties were bound and that there was no need to register the said agreement to align it with the Chattels Transfer Act as the Act was repealed by the 
Movable Property Security Rights Act
 No. 13 of 2017. The trial court further found that as the appellant did not dispute the interest, the respondent was entitled to the full sum claimed of Kshs. 100,000 as well as costs of the suit.






6.
Aggrieved by the trial court’s judgement, the appellant filed this appeal dated 17th January 2023 in which she raised the following grounds of appeal:
1.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact in finding that there was a valid contract between the appellant and the respondent.
2.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact in finding that the document was signed and executed by the appellant and therefore there was a claim based on it. The document required legal compliance for it to be effective.
3.
That the trial magistrate erred in law by not taking into account the provisions of th law relating to the salient features of a contract which were not present in this contract.
4.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact in finding that there was a disbursement of the said amount allegedly loaned without any substantial proof of the same.
5.
That the trial magistrate erred in law in finding that the document presented by the respondent was an instrument in terms of the law and yet the requirements of registration was still pending.






7.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions but only the appellant filed submissions and further, there was no evidence that the respondent participated in this appeal. I will thus consider the evidence, the grounds of appeal, the appellant’s submissions and the respondent’s submissions filed before the trial court.








The Appellant’s Submissions


8.
The appellant submitted that she had at the trial, erroneously (through genuine mistake) relied upon the provisions of the Chattels Transfer Act Cap 28 (Repealed) instead of those of The  
Movable Property Security Rights Act
 of 2017 and now she requests this Court to consider the corresponding provisions of the latter statute as those provisions were carried over to the new Act, and as no miscarriage of justice will occur if those corresponding provisions of the subsequent Act of 2017 are considered.






9.
It was submitted that Section 6(3) of the 
Movable property Security Rights Act
, 2017, (section 21 of the Chattels Transfer Act Cap 28 (Repealed) provides that the security agreement must be in writing, must be signed by the grantor, must identify the secured creditor, must describe the security/ asset and the secured obligation, otherwise it is unenforceable under sub-section 4 thereunder and that the document dated 20th September 2022 was neither a contract nor an agreement as it was never executed/ signed by the Respondent herein who is not bound by it and is thus barred/ precluded by the doctrine of privity of contract (which binds a non-party or a third party to a contract from suing for its enforcement) from founding its claim on it and that thus, without a contract, there was no foundation or basis for the Respondent’s claim which ought to have failed at the outset.






10.
The appellant thus submitted that the security agreement dated 20th September 2022 bound neither the appellant nor the respondent as the respondent never executed it. That therefore it could thus not confer any rights to the respondent, or place any obligations upon the appellant.






11.
It was further submitted that if the court deems otherwise that the agreement as impugned was a security agreement, then the respondent’s right lay only in attaching and selling the secured assets/ collateral rather than in filing a suit before the Small Claims Court, which suit was thus premature and that the respondent had, in any event, never proved that the collateral had dissipated so as to file a suit for recovery of the debt.








The Respondent’s Submission in the lower court


12.
The respondent submitted before the lower court that there was a valid contract between the parties herein with both parties executing the agreement dated 20.9.2022 and further that the appellant did offer chattels as security and consideration. It was further submitted that the appellant had neither produced any document nor asserted to the contrary and the response by the appellant before the trial court amounted to a mere denial.






13.
The respondent further submitted before the trial court that having established that there was a valid contract between the parties herein, then the appellant was liable to settle the claim in accordance with clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the contract. The respondent further submitted that she was entitled to the costs of her claim.








Analysis and Determination


14.
This is a first and last appeal from the Small Claims Court. Section 38 of the 
Small Claims Court Act
 is clear that appeals to this Court are final and on points of law only. The section provides:
“
38.
Appeals
(1)
A person aggrieved by the decision or an order of the Court may appeal against that decision or order to the High Court on matters of law.
(2)
An appeal from any decision or order referred to in subsection (1) shall be final.






15.
That said, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and make its own conclusions on proof of the claim by way of evidence adduced and the applicable law. It must, however, bear in mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand. In Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR, the court stated as follows-
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






16.
I have considered the pleadings, evidence adduced before the Small Claims Court and the grounds of appeal as well as the law applicable and the submissions.






17.
It is admitted by the appellant herein that the appropriate law in this case is the 
Movable Property Security Rights Act
 2017 and not the Chattels Transfer Act upon which the appellant’s whole defence before the trial court was anchored, the latter having been repealed by the former.






18.
On this basis alone, which basis is a legal basis, the appellant’s defence before the Small Claims Court was misplaced and was correctly dismissed.






19.
That notwithstanding, the appellant has offered a defence herein that the said contract between herself and the respondent was not valid as it did not meet the requirements of the Movable Property Security Rights, 2017. This is a point of law which this court is under a duty to consider.






20.
Section 6 of the 
Movable Property Security Rights Act
 2017 provides for the creation by execution of a security agreement. The section provides as follows:
6.
Creation by execution of a security agreement
1.
A security right is created by a security agreement, provided that the grantor has rights in the asset to be encumbered or the power to encumber it.
2.
A security agreement may provide for the creation of a security right in a future asset, but the security right in that asset is created only at the time when the grantor acquires rights in it or the power to encumber it.
3.
A security agreement shall—
a)
be in writing and signed by the grantor;
b)
identify the secured creditor and the grantor;
c)
except in the case of an agreement that provides for the outright transfer of a receivable, describe the secured obligation; and
d)
describe the collateral as provided in section 8.
(4)
A security agreement entered into in accordance with this section is enforceable and creates a security right, irrespective of the satisfaction of the requirements that may be imposed by any other written law.






21.
From the provisions above it is clear that there is no need for registration of the security as submitted by the appellant.






22.
The evidence of record shows that there was a contract between the parties herein executed on 20.9.2022 and further that the appellant did offer chattels as security and consideration for the loan advanced, contrary to the submissions and pleadings by the appellant.






23.
There was, between the parties herein, a contract which bound them and thus upon breach by either of the parties and as the parties failed to provide for dispute settlement clause in the said contract, there was no error or illegality in the respondent approaching the court for redress.






24.
It is a venerable principle of law that parties to a contract are bound by the terms and conditions thereof and that it is not the business of the Courts to rewrite such contracts. See the case of National Bank of Kenya Ltd v Pipe Plastic Samkolit (K) Ltd (2002) 2 E.A. 503, [2011 eKLR.






25.
There is no evidence of fraud, coercion, mistake or mis- representation and neither was any of the reasons for vitiating a contract pleaded and proved by the appellant herein.






26.
In the circumstances, I find the decision by the Adjudicator in line with the agreement between the parties. I find no reason to interfere with the same. I uphold the decision of the Small Claims Court Adjudicator.






27.
In the end, I find this appeal not merited. It is hereby dismissed.






28.
As the respondent did not participate in the appeal, I order that each parry shall bear their own costs of the appeal herein as dismissed.






29.
This file is hereby closed.

          (An appeal arising out of the Judgment & Decree of the Honourable E.A. Obina in the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Kisumu delivered on the 19th December 2022 in Kisumu CMCC No. 364 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellants were the defendants sued by the respondent plaintiff in the lower court vide a plaint dated 24
th
 August 2021 in which the respondent sought for general damages and special damages of Kshs. 140,130 for injuries that he sustained following a road traffic accident that occurred on or about the 5
th
 February 2021.






2.
The respondent’s case was that on the material date, he was lawfully riding his motorcycle registration no. KMCJ 343D along Kisian – Kisumu road moving towards Kisumu direction when near Skylark area the appellants’ motor vehicle registration number KAP 733N which was approaching from the opposite direction approaching the respondent was driven so carelessly, negligently and/or recklessly that it rammed into the respondent’s motorcycle leading to the respondent sustaining injuries.






3.
The appellants filed their statement of defence dated 13th September 2021 denying all the averments by the respondent and putting him to strict proof whilst attributing contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.






4.
In his judgement herein impugned, the trial magistrate found the appellants 90% liable for causing the accident whereas he held the respondent 10% liable. He proceeded to award the respondent Kshs. 1,000,000 in general damages which he added to the special damages claimed and lessened by 10% to arrive at a cumulative award of Kshs. 1,026,117 in favour of the respondent.






5.
Aggrieved by the trial court’s judgment, the appellants filed their appeal dated 17th January 2023 on 18
th
 January, 2023 in which they raised the following grounds of appeal:
1.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in treating the evidence and submissions on liability before him superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
2.
The learned trial magistrate erred in fact and law in awarding general damages for pain and suffering in a purely material damage claim.
3.
The learned trial magistrate erred in awarding damages for loss of user in the absence of evidence and/or sufficient evidence to support the same thereby arrived at a decision unsustainable in law.
4.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in treating the evidence and submissions on quantum before him superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
5.
The learned trial magistrate misdirected himself in ignoring the principles applicable and the relevant authorities cited in the written submissions presented and filed by the appellant.
6.
The learned trial magistrate erred in not sufficiently taking into account all the evidence presented before him in totality and in particular the evidence presented on behalf of the appellants.
7.
The learned trial magistrate erred in failing to hold that the respondent had failed to prove negligence on the part of the appellants while the onus of proof lay on the respondent.
8.
The learned trial magistrate proceeded on wrong principles (if any) when assessing the damages to be awarded to the respondent and failed to apply precedents and tenets of law applicable.
9.
The learned trial magistrate erred in awarding a sum in respect of damages which was so inordinately high in the circumstance that it represented an entirely erroneous estimate vis-à-vis the respondent’s claim.
10.
The learned trial magistrate failed to apply judicially and to adequately evaluate th evidence and exhibits tendered and thereby arrived at a decision unsustainable in law.
11.
The learned magistrate erred in finding the defendant 90% liable and the plaintiff only 10% liable since the plaintiff failed to avoid our insured motor vehicle causing the accident.
12.
The award of Kshs. 1,000,000 considering the plaintiff’s injuries is on the higher side.






6.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.








The Appellant’s Submissions


7.
The appellant submitted that throughout the trial process at the subordinate court, the respondent never established and proved to the required standard a single act of negligence by the appellants that caused the accident and further that he never called any medical doctor to testify in court and confirm the nature and degree of injuries suffered as a result of the alleged accident.






8.
It was the appellants’ submission that there were contradictions and inconsistencies in the respondent’s case like how he listed six witnesses he intended to call in support of his case but only ended up calling one, that he never called a single eye witness to testify in court and neither did he produce a sketch plan of the scene of the accident in an effort to prove his case.






9.
It was thus submitted that the glaring myriad of contradictions in eyewitness’ testimony and the witness statement filed before court ought to accord the appellants some benefit of doubt and find the respondent equally contributory negligent in the said accident.






10.
The appellants submitted that the trial magistrate did not demonstrate proper analysis of the facts and the law and as such the conclusion reached therein was unsustainable in law.






11.
It was submitted that the respondent in his own statement adopted by the court admitted that he was reckless and riding without any prior training and/or expertise and thus caused the accident by riding unlawfully and riding the said motorcycle in a zig-zag manner right in front of the suit motor vehicle.






12.
The appellants relied on the case of Pesa Hamisi v P.N. Mashru Limited [2020] eKLR where it was held interalia that if the possibility of danger emerging is reasonably apparent, then to take no precaution is negligence.






13.
It was further submitted that the respondent who sought redress in the Trial Court did not hold a current and valid riders’ license in total affront of the law and was therefore illegally and unlawfully riding it contrary to section 68 (3) of the 
Traffic Act
, 6 (1) of the National Transport & Safety Authority (Operation of Motorcycles) Regulations 2015.






14.
The appellants submitted that the mere fact that an accident occurred does not follow that a particular person has driven negligently and negligence must be inferred as was held in the case of Jamal Ramadhan Yusuf v Ruth Achieng Onditi & Anor [2010] eKLR.






15.
On quantum of damages, it was submitted that trial magistrate based his judgement on the wrong principles of law when assessing damages awarded to the respondent and that this court ought to set aside the decision by the trial court.






16.
It was submitted that an award of Kshs. 300,000 in damages was sufficient compensation for the respondent. Reliance was placed on the case of Harun Muyoma Boge v Daniel Agulo [2015] eKLR where the plaintiff sustained among other injuries, a compound fracture with permanent effects and the court awarded Kshs. 300,000 as well as the case of Rayan Investment Limited v Jeremiah Mwakulegwa Kasha [2017] eKLR where the claimant had suffered a fracture in the right fibula, severe blunt trauma in the left ankle joint, bruises on the right elbow and blunt trauma on the right wrist and the court awarded the claimant Kshs. 300,000.








The Respondent’s Submissions


17.
The respondent submitted that he proved his case on a balance of probabilities as required in civil cases and as set out in the cases of Kanyungu Njogu v Daniel Kimani Maingi [2000] eKLR and Kirugi & Anor v Kabiya & 3 Others [1987] KLR 347.






18.
On quantum, the respondent relied on his submissions before the trial court wherein he had submitted that a sum of Kshs. 1,000,000 was sufficient in general damages. The respondent had relied on the cases of Gichira Peter & Another v Jane Njura Mwangi Embu HCCA No. 23 of 2012 where the court awarded Kshs. 1,200,000 in general damages for injuries comparable to the ones sustained by the respondent as well as the case of SAO (Minor Suing Thro next Friend MOO v Registered Trustees, Anglican Church of Kenya Maseno North Parish [2017] eKLR where court awarded Kshs. 600,000 in general damages for injuries less severe to the ones sustained by the respondent.






19.
On liability, it was submitted that the appellants have failed to demonstrate how the trial court failed to consider their submissions and evidence whereas he tendered sufficient evidence against the appellant on liability on a balance of probability which was satisfactory leading to the trial court’s apportioning of liability.








Analysis and Determination


20.
This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and reach its own conclusions. It must, however, bear in mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand. In Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR, the court stated as follows-
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






21.
Thus, an appellate court will only interfere with the judgment of the lower court, if the said decision is founded on wrong legal principles. That was the holding of the Court of Appeal in Mkube v Nyamuro [1983] LLR at 403, where Kneller JA & Hancox Ag JJA held that-
“
A Court on appeal will not normally interfere with the finding of fact by a trial court unless it is based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the judge is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching his conclusion.”






22.
Having considered the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal and the parties’ Written Submissions, I find the issues for determination to be:
1.
Whether or not the apportionment of liability was fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
2.
Whether or not the award of quantum was unjustified in the circumstances of this case so as to warrant interference by this court.






23.
The above issues are resolved under the separate heads shown herein below.








Liability


24.
On liability, In Khambi and Another v Mahithi and Another [1968] EA 70, it was held that:
“
It is well settled that where a trial Judge has apportioned liability according to the fault of the parties his apportionment should not be interfered with on appeal, save in exceptional cases, as where there is some error in principle or the apportionment is manifestly erroneous, and an appellate court will not consider itself free to substitute its own apportionment for that made by the trial Judge.”






25.
That was the position in Isabella Wanjiru Karangu v Washington Malele Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1981 [1983] KLR 142 and Mahendra M Malde v George M Angira Civil Appeal No. 12 of 1981, where it was held that apportionment of blame represents an exercise of a discretion with which the appellate court will interfere only when it is clearly wrong, or based on no evidence or on the application of a wrong principle.






26.
On the burden of proof, the law is clear that he who alleges must proof. See section 107 and 108 of the 
Evidence Act
. The question therefore is whether the respondent herein discharged the burden of proof that the appellants were liable in negligence to the extent stated by the trial court for the occurrence of the accident wherein he was allegedly injured.






27.
The respondent was the only witness who testified in support of his case as PW2, No. 71788 P.C. Biwott testified and produced the police abstract for the said accident subject of this appeal. The respondent adopted his recorded statement filed together with his claim as his testimony in chief.






28.
For avoidance of doubt, a police abstract is not evidence of negligence and neither is failure to charge any of the parties involved in a collision accident evidence that no one or both were to blame for the accident in equal measure. Each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. This is so because the standard of proof in traffic cases which are criminal cases is that of beyond reasonable doubt whereas the standard of proof in civil cases is on a balance of probabilities.






29.
It was the respondent’s case that on the said date, the 5
th
 February 2021, he was lawfully riding his motorcycle registration No. KMCJ 343D along Kisian – Kisumu road moving towards Kisumu direction when near Skylark area, the appellants’ motor vehicle registration number KAP 733N which was approaching from the opposite direction approaching the respondent was driven so carelessly, negligently and/or recklessly driven as to ram his motorcycle leading to the respondent sustaining injuries. The respondent testified that the appellants’ motor vehicle was being driven on the wrong side of the road as it was on his lane and that there was a trailer behind him and thus despite his efforts to evade colliding with the oncoming appellants’ vehicle by slowing down, hooting and flashing his lights and even moving to the extreme left side of the road, he ended up being knocked down by the appellants’ vehicle on his left side.






30.
In cross-examination, the respondent stated that he had a licence and also had a helmet on the date of the accident and also wore a reflective jacket.






31.
The appellants called two witnesses in support of their defence. DW1, Alphonse Amondi Omboya, the driver of the suit vehicle adopted his recorded statement as his evidence in chief wherein he had stated that he was manoeuvring to park the said vehicle in front of Skylark when an oncoming motorcyclist at high speed grazed his front wing panel and shattered his side mirror with the impact throwing the rider behind him on the tarmac. DW1 testified that he did not get on to the tarmac. He further testified that the rider did not have a helmet and wore sandals and that he subsequently followed the rider to hospital where he saw that the rider had a broken leg.






32.
In cross-examination, he reiterated his testimony and further stated that he saw the motor cyclist 30 metres away and who not concentrating and so he put hazards and full lights on.






33.
DW2, Vincent Ochieng Odhiambo similarly adopted his statement of 20.9.2021 as his evidence in chief. He reiterated DW1’s testimony and stated that they were going to park the suit vehicle at a Perch Hotel and further that the suit vehicle was not in motion when the respondent’s motorcycle crashed into them. He reiterated that the rider did not have a helmet. In his statement, DW2 had stated that when the suit vehicle was being reversed is when the accident occurred. He reiterated his testimony in cross-examination.






34.
I have considered the evidence tendered before the trial court and I note that contrary to the appellants’ submissions before this court, the respondent was firm and consistent in his statement and testimony before the trial court.






35.
On their part, the both appellants’ witnesses told the court that the suit vehicle was not in motion when the accident occurred, but, in their statements, they indicated that the car was moving when the accident occurred. DW1 testified that he was maneuvering his way into a parking slot when the accident occurred and similarly DW2 had stated that DW1 was reversing when the accident occurred.






36.
The appellants submitted that the respondent had no helmet and was also not a licensed rider. However, this is contrary to the evidence on record. The respondent testified that he had a license and that it was on his phone. The appellants did not push him further on this and neither did they adduce any contrary evidence. Also, the respondent testified that he had a helmet when the accident occurred, a fact that was not controverted by the appellants. I hasten to add that in modern times where mobile phones play a very important role in evidence gathering, there is no reason why the appellants’ witnesses who themselves were not injured could not take photographs of the scene of accident and on how the respondent appeared allegedly without a helmet and in sandals when riding a motor cycle when he was involved in the accident.






37.
There is no doubt that an accident occurred, that the respondent was riding towards Kisumu from Kisian direction; that the appellants’ driver was looking for a parking at Skylark area which was the opposite direction from where the respondent was approaching from but on the same side. In essence, my view is that the appellants’ driver was on the respondent’s side of the road and had not left the road completely when the collision took place. That being said, it is also clear that the respondent was riding at a high speed as testified by both appellants’ witnesses and as such, he could not take the necessary measures to avoid the accident. Although the respondent testified that there was a vehicle right behind him, he did not say that there was another oncoming vehicle on his right and since he was facing the direction where the appellants’ vehicle was, nothing prevented him from swerving to the right to avoid hitting the appellants’ vehicle.






38.
Taking into account all the aforementioned circumstances, I find that the respondent contributed to the occurrence of the accident by riding at a high speed and failing to swerve so as to avoid the accident. It follows that his contribution to the accident was not just 10% as was apportioned by the trial court. I find that the respondent contributed to the accident in the ratio of 30%.






39.
I therefore interfere with the apportionment by the trial court which I hereby set aside and substitute it with 30% contribution.








Quantum


40.
The appellants submitted that the award on quantum of damages to the respondent was inordinately high considering the injuries sustained by the respondent and past comparable awards and that this court ought to reduce the same to Kshs. 300,000. On his part, the respondent submitted that the award of Kshs. 1,000,000 was sufficient and urged this court to uphold the same.






41.
In in Butt v Khan [1982-88] KAR 1 it was held -
“
An appellate court will not disturb an award for damages unless it is inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate. It must be shown that the judge proceeded on wrong principles, or that he misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low.”






42.
I have considered the submissions tendered together with the authorities cited by the parties. As the Respondent did not cross-appeal against the finding and conclusion of the trial magistrate, I think the issue is simply whether the award was too high as contended by the Appellants.






43.
General damages are damages at large whose purpose is to compensate the injured to the extent that such injury can be assuaged by a money award. It is now settled law that money cannot renew a physical frame that has been injured and crushed hence the courts can only award sums which must be viewed as giving reasonable compensation. Further, that awards ought to be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation bearing in mind that the large and inordinate awards may injure the body politic. Furthermore, it is desirable that so far as possible, comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards putting into consideration the current prevailing economic circumstances including inflation (see Tayab v Kinanu [1983] KLR 114 and West (H) & Son Ltd v Shephard [1964] AC 326, 345).






44.
The respondent pleaded that he sustained the following injuries:
Displaced bimmalleolar fractures of the left ankle joint.
Medical subluxation of the ankle joint
Dislocation of the left ankle joint
Swelling of the right leg
Injury to the left shoulder
Neck tenderness
Chest tenderness
Backache






45.
The said injuries were substantiated in the P3 form produced by the respondent as exhibit 8a wherein it was also noted that the respondent had sustained injuries in the nature of grievous harm. The said injuries were further documented in treatment notes produced as exhibits 2 – 6 and the medical legal report dated 20.8.2021 by Professor L.W. Okombo produced as exhibit 7a. In his own testimony the respondent testified that he had sustained a fracture.






46.
Taking all the aforementioned into consideration, it is my view that the respondent sustained a fracture of the left ankle joint and also suffered soft tissue injuries to the right leg, left shoulder, neck, chest and back.






47.
Having considered the parties’ authorities, the trial court found those relied on by the appellants to be on the lower side and proceeded to grant the award for quantum claimed by the respondent of Kshs. 1,000,000.






48.
In Rayan Investments Limited supra relied at by the appellants, the court awarded the claimant a sum of Kshs. 300,000 as general damages for a fracture of the right fibula, severe blunt trauma on the left; ankle joint, bruises on the right elbow and blunt trauma on the right wrist.






49.
Contrary to submissions by the respondent, in SAO (Minor Suing Thro next Friend MOO) supra where the court awarded Kshs. 600,000 in general damages, the injuries sustained by the claimant therein were far severe than those sustained by the respondent herein as they included:
Head injury with brain concussion and damage of right lower mandible jaw and left cheek
Blunt chest injury
Multiple friction lacerations/bruises on right elbow joint
Fracture of right tibia/fibula at midshaft region
Compound fracture left tibia/fibula at distal metaphysic
Multiple cut wounds on left lower limb involving thigh down to knee region
Fracture left ankle joint involving malleolus bones
Dislocation right ankle joint






50.
In the much older case of Ambrose Micheni Kinyamu v Gilbert Bundi & Another [2012] eKLR, the appellant sustained fracture of the right leg on the ankle. The appellate court in 2012 enhanced the award given by the trial court to Kshs. 400,000.






51.
In the case of Daniel Otieno Owino & another v Elizabeth Atieno Owuor [2020] eKLR, the Respondent had sustained head injuries with cut wounds, chest injuries, injuries to the right leg with cut wounds and a fracture, injuries to the left lower leg ankle joint and injuries on the left thigh. In its judgment delivered in May 2020, High Court reduced the award of Kshs. 600,000/= by the lower court to Kshs. 400,000.






52.
Finally, in the case of Vincent Mbogholi v Harrison Tunje Chilyalya [2017] eKLR the appellate court declined to disturb an award of Kshs. 500,000.00 for a fracture of the left tibia leg bone (medial malleolus), blunt injury to the chest and left lower limb and bruises on the left forearm, right foot and right big toe.






53.
In the circumstances of this case, it is my opinion that the award of Kshs. 1,000,000 by the trial court was inordinately high and not comparable to similar cases with comparable injury. I find that an award of Kshs. 550,000 would be sufficient in the circumstances. Accordingly, I set aside the award of Kshs 1,000,000 general damages and substitute it with an award of kshs 550,000 taking into account inflation and time lapse since the decisions cited above were made.






54.
As special damages were not disputed by the appellants as shown by the submissions made, I find no reason to interfere with the same.






55.
I therefore allow this appeal in the following terms:
a.
Liability- appellants to bear 70% while the appellant shall bear 30% contribution.
b.
General damages ………………….. Kshs.550,000
Less 30% contribution …………... Kshs. 165,000
Kshs.385,000
Add Special damages ………………Kshs. 140,130
Grand Total ………………………Kshs. 525, 130






56.
I order that each party bear their own costs of the appeal as the damages awarded have been substantially reduced following the enhancement of contributory negligence and reduction of general damages.

          (Being an appeal against the Judgment and Decree of Hon. B.Mararo Senior Principal Magistrate delivered on 3rd October, 2023 in Nanyuki MCELRC No.1 of 202)
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
This appeal concerns compensation for work related injury. The respondent was awarded Kshs.511,532.00 by the County Occupational Safety & Health Officer (COSHO) on 20
th
 May 2019. The award was never challenged but on 21
st
 November 2019, the parties herein executed form DOSH/WIBA 5A, titled: “FORM OF AGREEMENT AS TO WORK INJURY BENEFITS TO BE PAID BY THE EMPLOYER TO THE INJURED EMPLOYEE”. In the said, it was agreed that the appellant would pay the respondent Kshs.280,640 in discharge of the liability of the employer to pay compensation under the Act in respect of the injury to the employee. On the same day the respondent was paid the agreed sum and a certificate of payment was issued.






2.
Thereafter, the respondent filed a suit claiming damages for unlawful termination plus the outstanding balance of the award in respect of the Work injury aforesaid being Kshs.230,892. She also sought to recover Kshs.611,000 being conveyance costs due to the said Work Injury.






3.
The appellant denied the claim for termination and averred that the respondent had absconded duty. It further pleaded that the claim for work injury was fully settled and the suit was in fact statute barred. Trial court considered the pleadings, evidence and dismissed the claim for unlawful termination and conveyance expenses but allowed the claim for outstanding balance of the work injury claim.






4.
The appellant was aggrieved and brought this appeal seeking that the impugned judgment be set aside and the suit be dismissed with costs. The appeal stands on the following grounds: -
a.
That the Honourable trial court erred in fact by holding that the Respondent did not dispute the claim of Kshs.230,000 being part of the award made to the claimant by the County Occupational Safety and Health Officer despite the fact that this monetary claim was expressly denied in the statement of Response and disproved in the evidence adduced on behalf of the Respondent.
b.
That the Honourable trial court erred in law by permitting the claimant to renege on the Respondent’s exhibit DEXH 2 being an agreement dated 21/11/2019 executed by both parties and which discharged the Respondent from liability upon payment of Kshs.280,640/-.
c.
That the Honourable trial court erred in law by permitting the claimant to enforce a claim, and/or an award made, under the 
Work Injury Benefits Act
, 2007 by way of a statement of claim before a Magistrates Court.
d.
That the Honourable trial court erred in law and fact by awarding interest on costs without stating the grounds for condemning the Respondent with interest on costs.








Submissions


5.
It was submitted for the appellant that the trial court erred in fact by awarding the said Kshs.230,000 yet both parties had produced a copy of an agreement by which the parties unequivocally set the compensation at Kshs.280,640 all inclusive and the same was fully paid. Further that, the respondent accepted the said payment and discharged the appellant for further liability under WIBA.






6.
It urged that the trial court overlooked the said evidence in awarding the claim for Kshs.230,000 and therefore the appeal ought to be allowed and the respondent suit dismissed with costs.






7.
On the other hand, it was submitted for the respondent that while agreement exempted the appellant for liability, it did not reflect the legal and lawful award dated 20
th
 May 2019. It was therefore urged that the appellant only made a partial payment of the award by Director and the trial court was right in awarding Kshs.230,892.






8.
As regards the procedure followed in suing for the outstanding balance of award, it was submitted that respondent only prayed for enforcement of the award made by DOSH. For emphasis, reliance was placed on the case of Joash Shisia Cheto v Thepot Patrick Charles (2022) eKLR where it was held that there is no clear mechanism for enforcing DOSH awards and therefore a party can do so before this court or the lower court. Therefore, it was urged that the trial court had the jurisdiction to adopt and enforce the award herein and even to award interest thereon.






9.
Finally, it was submitted that the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing the respondents claim for unlawful dismissal and prayed for award of Kshs.414,926.20 inclusive of terminal dues.








Analysis and determination


10.
This being a first appeal, my mandate is to re-evaluate the evidence on record and make my own independent conclusions but taking into account the fact that I did not see the witnesses giving evidence. I am guided by the decision of Court of Appeal in the case of Selle v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd (1968) EA 123 where the court held thus: -
“
The appellate court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from a trial by the High Court is by way of a retrial and the principles upon which the Court of Appeal acts are that the court must consider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, the court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial Judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate he evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






11.
Having considered the record of appeal and the submissions made on the appeal, the following issues fall for determination: -
a.
Whether the respondent is estopped from claiming the Kshs.230,000 from the appellant.
b.
What are the appropriate orders.








Estopped against the claim


12.
This appeal turns on an agreement dated 21
st
 November 2019 contained in DOSH/WIBA 5A which states in part as follows: -
“
Now it is hereby agreed as follows:
Subject to the right to either the employer or the employee to make appeal to the Industrial Court under section 52, subsection (2) of the Work Injury Benefit Act before the execution of this agreement-
a.
As compensation for such injury as aforesaid, the employer will pay to the employee the sum of Kshs.280,640 in discharge of the liability (if any) of the employer under the said Act;
b.
The employee will accept the aforesaid sum of Kshs.280,640 in discharge of liability of the employer to pay compensation under the said Act in respect of the said injury to the employee.”






13.
The said agreement was made after the Director had determined the compensation payable to the respondent and communicated the same vide a demand (DOSH/WIBA 4) on 20
th
 May 2019. The award was Kshs.511,532 payable within 90 days of the demand. The appellant neither paid nor challenged the award. Instead, the parties executed the said agreement for payment of Kshs.280,640 as full settlement and discharge of the appellant from liability to pay compensation under the WIBA.






14.
My understanding of the said agreement was to settle the compensation claim amicably without involving the Director under the Act. The parties agreed on a compensation and the respondent waived and discharged the appellant from liability to compensate her under WIBA. The question that arises is whether the respondent voluntarily executed the agreement or not.






15.
She answered the question during the hearing, by stating that she signed the agreement (Exh.IV) because she needed money. She admitted that she agreed to the payment of Kshs.280,000 and discharged the appellant from liability. She admitted that the discharge was not qualified. Finally, she agreed that she received the said sum the same day she signed the agreement. (Exh.IV)






16.
The respondent did not plead or prove any vitiating factor that could invalidate the said agreement. She consented to the arrangement and voluntarily signed the agreement in the presence of COSHO, who stamped the same. Consequently, I find and hold that the settlement agreement dated 21
st
 November 2019 constituted a binding contract between the parties herein and it fully discharged the appellant from liability to compensate the respondent under the WIBA.






17.
I gather support from the case of Coastal Bottlers Ltd v Kimathi Mithika (2018) eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that: -
“
Whether or not a settlement agreement or discharge voucher bars a party thereto from making further claim depends on the circumstances of each case.
A court faced with such an issue, in our view, should address its mind firstly upon the import of such a discharge/agreement; and secondly whether the same was voluntarily executed by the concerned parties.
Further, a Discharge Voucher is a binding contract and it constituted a full discharge and the Court should not entertain the suit filed after execution of the discharge.”








Appropriate orders


18.
In view of the foregoing finding, I agree with the appellant that the award of Kshs.230,000 was not supported by evidence and it must give way. Consequently, I allow the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and substitute it with an order dismissing the suit all together. However, I will not condemn the respondent to costs because the appellant was the beneficiary from the settlement agreement as the respondent lost a bigger award under the WIBA.

Judgment










1.
By the amended Statement of Claim dated 19
th
 June 2023, the claimant sued the respondent seeking the following reliefs:
a.
A declaration that the Respondent be ordered to forthwith pay the claimant his sabbatical leave days for nine (9) months as per the salary scale of Kshs.1,244,503 x 9=11,200,527/- as per the Vice-Chancellor rates.
b.
An order compelling Respondent to forthwith pay the claimant his Gratuity benefits of Kshs.168,751.88.
c.
An order compelling the Respondent to stop deducting the gratuity so far paid to the claimant henceforth.
d.
An order compelling the Respondent to pay the claimant’s unpaid Annual leave of Kshs.3,650.542.
e.
Cost of the claim and interest at court’s rates.






2.
The respondent denied liability and averred that it paid the claimant all his dues as its vice chancellor and even exceeded by Kshs.831,704.






Factual background


3.
The claimant was appointed as a Principal of Meru University College for five years from 29
th
 March, 2010 but vide another letter dated 14
th
 August 2014 he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the respondent for the five years with effect from 21
st
 June 2013. His contract as the Vice Chancellor were governed by the Terms and conditions of service for a Vice Chancellor. Some of the terms his contract included a sabbatical leave at the end of the contract, annual leave and payment of gratuity for at the rate of 31% of basic salary every two completed years less what the employer would have contributed towards his pension scheme.






4.
The claimant served the whole contract term and exited as the Vice Chancellor but was employed by the respondent as a Professor. He then proceeded on Sabbatical leave for nine months but he was paid the salary of a Professor being a basic salary of Kshs.248,898 and house allowance of Kshs.73,715 totalling to Kshs.322,613. The said amount was contrary to the said terms and condition for Vice Chancellor which entitled the claimant to the same benefits he enjoyed during his tenure of duty as Vice Chancellor.






5.
A dispute arose and the respondent was advised by the Attorney General that the pay for the claimant during the sabbatical leave was the amount he was earning as Vice Chancellor. The respondent regularised the payment in August 2022 using the correct salary of Kshs.1,244, 503 and added a further Kshs.831,704 as gratuity during the period of sabbatical leave.






6.
On 15
th
 May 2022, the claimant received a letter informing him that the respondent would be recovering Kshs.831,704 for being an erroneous payment of gratuity during the sabbatical leave. The said payment was approved by respondent through an internal memo dated 15
th
 December 2020. He was then deducted a total of Kshs.168,751.88 between May-July, 2022. The claimant brought this suit and obtained orders to stop the said recovery pending the determination of the suit.








Evidence


7.
The claimant testified as CW1 and adopted his written statement and bundle of 14 documents as his evidence in chief. He reiterated the above facts in his testimony and clarified that Clause 9.8 of the Terms and conditions of service of a Vice Chancellor, entitled him to nine months sabbatical leave with the salary and benefits of a Vice Chancellor. He contended that his salary as Vice Chancellor was Kshs.1,244,503 per month and therefore his total salary for the nine months he was on sabbatical leave was Kshs.11,200,527.






8.
He further stated that under clause 9.3 of the said terms and conditions of service, he was entitled to 40 days annual leave and he had been authorised by the chairman of the University Council to accumulate some 88 leave days as at the end of his contract. He produced letters to that effect which bears an endorsement by the chairman.






9.
He also testified that clause 12 of the said terms and conditions of service entitled him to gratuity of 31% of his basic salary every two years. He admitted receipt of Kshs.831,704 as gratuity for the period he was on sabbatical leave out of which Kshs.168,758 was recovered as erroneous payment. He produced his pay slips for May, June and July 2022 as evidence. He contended that the respondent has not filed any counter claim against him.






10.
On cross examination, he admitted receipt of a gross pay of Kshs.11,393,293 in August 2019, which after statutory deductions, the net was about Kshs.7,000,000. He sought clarification from the respondent but got none. He contended that sabbatical leave was part of his contract as Vice Chancellor and therefore he was entitled to gratuity and sabbatical leave based on the salary he was getting as vice chancellor being Kshs.1,244,503. He further contended that he was entitled to 88 leave days since the chairman of the council had approved the accumulation of the leave.






11.
The respondent’s Vice Chancellor, Professor Romanus Odhiambo Otieno, testified as RW1. He adopted his written statement dated 29
th
 June 2023 and 15 documents as his evidence. He then clarified that the claimant was paid all his gross salary of Kshs.11,393,292 for the nine months sabbatical leave as per his pay slip for August 2019. The said amount was subjected to statutory deductions leaving a net pay of Kshs.7.4 million. He further stated that the sabbatical leave was not part of the five years term of the vice chancellor. He contended that the sabbatical leave was just a benefit to allow the vice chancellor to rest. He contended that the gratuity provided under clause 12 (3) of the terms and conditions of service did not extend to the period of sabbatical leave.






12.
He stated that the respondent erroneously paid the claimant gratuity for the period of sabbatical leave but the Auditors directed that the erroneous payment be recovered. The Attorney General also advised that the money be recovered from the claimant, hence the deductions from his salary.






13.
As regards the claim for leave, he maintained that claimant was not allowed to accumulate leave without approval from the chairman of the council. He contended that the claim for 88 leave days should be declined because the claimant did not get approval from the chairman to carry forward the same.






14.
On cross-examination, he maintained that the payment of gratuity during sabbatical leave was erroneous because he was no longer the vice chancellor. Besides his pension was being remitted for him as a Professor at the rate of 10% as employer’s contribution. He however admitted that there was written consent by the claimant authorising deductions of his salary to recover the erroneous payment. He admitted that a total of Kshs.168,751 was recovered from the claimant through salary deductions. He contended that there was no need to file a counter claim because as soon as the court order is lifted, recovery process will resume as a natural cause.






15.
He further admitted that the claimant was entitled to salary of vice chancellor during his sabbatical leave and it was paid as arrears in August 2019 after receiving advise from the Attorney General.






16.
He admitted also that the claimant had 88 leave days outstanding. He confirmed that the claimant requested to carry forward the 88 days vide letter (Exhibit 10) and it was approved by the chairman of the council. He further confirmed that he was not present when the chairman signed the leave form. He confirmed further that the chairman had made similar approval before but without affixing any stamp on it.








Submissions


17.
It was submitted for the claimant that the payment of Kshs.11,393,293 was an underpayment of Kshs.129,847 because it included salary for August 2019. It was submitted that when you deduct the Basic salary of Kshs.248,898 and house allowance of Kshs.73,715 from the total Kshs.11,393,293 you remain with Kshs.11,070,680 instead of the correct sum of Kshs.11,200,527 made up of monthly salary of Kshs.1,244,503 x 9 months.






18.
As regards gratuity for the nine months sabbatical leave, it was argued that the sum of Kshs.831,704 was not erroneous pay as alleged by the respondent. Reliance was placed on clause 9.8 of the terms and conditions of service to urge that the claimant was entitled to gratuity during the nine months sabbatical leave because it was part of his contract as Vice Chancellor. Consequently, the recovery of Kshs.168,757.88 from salary ought to be reimbursed and the respondent barred from further deductions from the claimant’s salary.






19.
As regards the claim for leave, it was submitted that the claimant adduced evidence to prove that the accumulation of the 88 leave days not taken was approved by the chairman of the respondent’s council. Therefore, it was argued that the claimant is entitled to Kshs.3,650,542.13 for 88 days leave based on his salary of Kshs.1,244,503.






20.
On the other hand, the respondent submitted that the alleged arrears of Kshs.129,847 was not pleaded and as such it is in attempt to sneak in a new prayer. It urged that the same ought to be disregarded since parties are bound by their pleadings.






21.
As regards the claim for gratuity during the sabbatical leave, it was argued that the said period did not form part of the contract period of five years for the Vice chancellor. Consequently, clause 12 of the terms and conditions of service did not apply to the period of sabbatical leave which was taken after the lapse of the contract.






22.
Finally, the claim for 88 annual leave days was denied and the respondent reiterated that all the days not utilized or carried forward with the approval of the chairman was forfeited. It was further argued that the 40 leave days for 2018 were utilised when the claimant took 15 days leave from 5
th
 February 2018 and 25 days from 7
th
 March 2018. Consequently, the court was urged to dismiss the suit with costs.








Analysis and determination


23.
The issues for determination are: -
a.
Whether the claimant is entitled to the claim for Kshs.11,200,527 being salary during sabbatical leave of 9 months.
b.
Whether the claimant is entitled to reimbursement of Kshs.168,751.88 and protection from further recovery of gratuity paid to him.
c.
Whether claimant is entitled to payment of Kshs.3,650,542 for 88 leave days.
d.
Who should pay costs of the suit?






Salary during sabbatical leave


24.
The claimant prayed for Kshs.11,200,527 calculated using Kshs.1,244,503 per month for 9 months. During the hearing, he admitted receipt of Kshs.11,393,293 in August 2019 which included the salary for that month. The salary for August 2019 was Kshs.248,898 plus house allowance of Kshs.73,715 totaling to Kshs.322,613 hence the payment toward salary during sabbatical leave was Kshs.11,070,680. The correct salary during sabbatical leave was Kshs.1,244,503 X 9 months =Kshs.11,200,527 less Kshs.11,070,680 paid =Kshs.129,847 outstanding.






25.
The respondent submitted that the said outstanding salary arrears of Kshs.129,847 cannot be granted because it was not pleaded. However, the court finds that the Kshs.129,847 was part of the Kshs.11,200,527 pleaded in the claimants Amended statement of claim and therefore I award the same to him.








Gratuity during sabbatical leave


26.
The claim for gratuity during sabbatical leave is based on the believe by the claimant that, it was a benefit attached to the expired contract as a vice chancellor. Clause 12 (a) states as follows: -
“
The Vice Chancellor shall be paid 31% of basic salary every two completed years, less what the employer would have contributed towards his/her pension scheme.”






27.
The respondent is of a different view, that paying the said gratuity would amount to extending the contract by nine months. I can’t agree more with the respondent. The benefit of gratuity to the claimant was limited to the contract period of five years.






28.
Clause 12 (a) of the Terms and Conditions of Service for a Vice Chancellor does not apply to the period when the retired Vice Chancellor proceed on sabbatical leave at the end of his contract. Doing so would be extending the contract period beyond five years. Consequently, the court cannot protect the claimant from the recovery of Kshs.831,704 erroneously paid to him as gratuity for the nine months sabbatical leave. Doing so would be rewriting the terms of the contract for the parties of which the court does not have jurisdiction.








Annual leave


29.
The bone of contention is 88 leave days which accrued during claimant’s tenure as vice chancellor. Clause 9.3 of the Terms and Conditions of Service bars a vice chancellor from accumulating leave except with written approval of the chairman of the council. If the leave is not taken and no approval for accumulation was given, the leave not taken stood forfeited.






30.
In this case, there is evidence that the approval to accumulate leave was granted by the chairman of the council. By a letter dated 6
th
 May 2016, the claimant sought to carry forward 107 leave days and it was approved by the chairman the same day. By another letter dated 10
th
 February 2017, the claimant sought to carry forward 143 leave days and it was approved by the chairman on 17
th
 February 2017.






31.
By a leave application dated 6
th
 March 2018, he applied for 73 leave days and left 88 days to be carried forward and the chairman approved the same. On the said 6
th
 March 2018, the chairman of the council wrote to him informing him that his contract would not be renewed and that he was required to proceed on his terminal and annual leave. Obviously, the remaining days of his contract were fewer than the accumulated leave. Consequently, I find that the claimant is entitled to 88 leave days which was accumulated with the permission of the chairman of the respondent’s council.






32.
The leave is based on the claimant’s basic salary as vice chancellor being Kshs.683,292. Hence Kshs.683,292 X 88/30 = Kshs.2,004,323.20.










Conclusion


33.
I have found that the claimant is entitled to salary arrears for the period he was on sabbatical leave plus 88 leave days accumulated with the approval of the chairman of the respondent’s council. Consequently, I enter judgment for him against the respondent as follows: -
i.
Salary arrears……………………………………………..Kshs.129,847.00

Judgment










1.
This suit arises from a Work Injury claim by the Interested Party against the claimant. The interested party was injured while in the cause of employment by the claimant and compensation was assessed by the Director of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) on 21
st
 August 2017 at Kshs.840,635.10. Subsequently, the claimant notified the respondent (its insurer) of the claim vide the letter dated 13
th
 February 2018 but the claim was not settled. However, the respondent wrote to the claimant on 18
th
 January 2019 requesting the claimant to refer the interested Party to a second medical examination by Dr.Wambugu P.M.






2.
Nothing came out of the foregoing exercise and the Interested Party filed application for adoption of the Directors award and enforcement. The claimant opposed but after hearing the parties the court allowed the application as prayed.






3.
The claimant then filed the instant suit seeking the following orders against the respondent.
a.
A declaration that the Defendant is liable to satisfy the judgment/decree in Meru Elrc Misc Appl.No. E009 Of 2022.
b.
Costs of the suit.






4.
The respondent never filed any response after service but the Interested Party did. The suit was first listed for hearing on 9
th
 November 2023 when the claimant called its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as its witness (CW1).






5.
In brief, CW1 stated that the interested party was involved in a motorcycle accident while in the course of duty on 23
rd
 December 2016 and a report was made to the DOSH. On 21
st
 August 2017, compensation of damages was then assessed by DOSH at Kshs.840,635.10 and it notified the respondent vide the letter dated 13
th
 February 2018.






6.
The award was never paid and the interested party filed Meru ELRC Misc.Applicati
on No. E009 of 2022
 for adoption of the award by Dosh as a decree of the court. The application was allowed and execution commenced. He prayed for judgment as prayed because at the time of the material accident, the claimant had taken out an insurance cover from the respondent.






7.
On cross examination, CW1 admitted that he did not produce the insurance contract between the claimant and the respondent. However, he contended that the respondent had made a proposal to pay six years ago (see Document No.8). He further admitted that the DOSH never wrote any demand for payment to the respondent. He also admitted that the NCAJ (Ombudsman) wrote to the claimant to pay the claim to the interested party.






8.
He stated that he served the respondent with a copy of the court judgment and decree in the primary suit but he failed to produce it as exhibit herein. He contended that the obligation to settle the compensation to interested party is on the respondent because it had insured him. However, the respondent had failed to pay despite every effort being made to pursue it. He admitted that the Interested Party was not a party to the contract between the claimant and the respondent.






9.
When the suit came up for hearing of the interested party’s case on 8
th
 April 2024, his counsel told the court that the judgment debt in the primary suit had been fully settled by the claimant. The claimant confirmed the settlement and prayed for the claim against the interested party to be struck out and it be given 14 days to file written submissions.






10.
The claimant filed submissions which basically reiterates the facts of the case as they appear in the pleadings and the evidence save that it was argued that section 7 of WIBA makes it mandatory for employer to take out and maintain insurance policy to cover employees. That since the claimant had taken out insurance cover from the respondent, it is only proper that declaratory order sought in the suit be granted.






11.
For emphasis, reliance was placed on Margaret Gakenia Mwaniki v Kenya Orient Insurance Limited (2020) eKLR where the court found that the Insurance Company had a legal duty to indemnify the insured for liabilities incurred as a result of accident that damaged a vehicle.






Analysis


12.
The only issue for determination is whether the respondent should indemnify the claimant for the financial loss incurred when it settled the claim for the interested party. Having considered the pleadings and the evidence on record, there is no dispute that the respondent had voluntarily entered into an insurance contract with the claimant to cover work- injury claims by the claimants’ employees.






13.
There is also no dispute that the interested party was injured while in the course of employment by the claimant. It is also a fact that the DOSH assessed compensation of Kshs.840,635.10 in favour of the interested party and the respondent was made aware of the same. It is also a fact that the respondent did not settle or challenge it as required under section 51 and 52 of the WIBA.






14.
As a result of the foregoing, judgment was entered in favour of the interested party and during the pendency of this suit, the decree was settled. Since the respondent never filed defence to challenge the suit herein, I am satisfied that the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought. Consequently, I enter judgment in favour of the claimant in the following terms: -
a.
A declaration be and is hereby made that the respondent is liable to satisfy the judgment/decree in Meru ELRC Misc. Applicati
on No. E009 of 2022
.
b.
Costs of the suit to the claimant.

Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          ((Being an appeal against conviction and sentence arising in Kandara Law Courts Criminal Case S.O No. 41 of 2018 delivered on 26th September, 2019 by Hon. M. Kinyanjui, P.M.))
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006.
The particulars of the offence are that; on 01
st
 June, 2018 at [Particulars Withheld], within Murang’a County, he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of L.M.W, a child aged 16 years. He was also charged with an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






2.
He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to serve ten (10) years’ imprisonment on the main charge. It is that conviction and sentence that necessitated the instant appeal wherein the Appellant raised the grounds of appeal enumerated as follows;
I.
That, the learned trial magistrate erred in matters of law and fact by failing to consider that the voire dire was conducted contrary to the laid-out stages for determining whether the minor should be sworn.
II.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in matters of law and fact by failing to establish paternity through a DNA test so that the contradictions in the evidence would have been resolved.
III.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in points of law and facts by failing to find that the elements of the offence of defilement were not conclusively proved to warrant a conviction.
IV.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in points of law and facts by failing to find that there was no direct or circumstantial link between the alleged commission of the offence and the arrest of the Appellant.
V.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in matters of law and fact for failure to procure the evidence of an informer who was a very crucial witness in the matter beforehand.
VI.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in matters of law and fact by convicting on a matter that was not proved beyond all reasonable shadow of doubt.






3.
The Court directed that the parties file written submissions at the appeal hearing. The Appellant submitted that the evidence of PW1 was not correctly received and faulted the quality of investigations conducted. He submitted that the prosecution had not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial court convicted him based on suspicion.






4.
On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that the ingredients of the offence of defilement had been proved and urged the court to uphold the conviction and sentence.






5.
I have considered the appeal before me and the written submissions by both parties. The duty of this court while exercising its appellate jurisdiction was set out in the case of Mark Oiruri Mose v R (2013) eKLR thus: -
“
This Court is duty bound to revisit the evidence tendered before the trial court afresh, evaluate it, analyze it, and come to its own independent conclusion on the matter but always bearing in mind that the trial court had the advantage of observing the demeanor of the witnesses and hearing them give evidence and give allowance for that.”






6.
The prosecution called five witnesses in support of their case. PW1 was the complainant; she testified that she was 17 years old and was born on November 18, 2001. Her evidence was that she was defiled by the Appellant in his house during a visit that she had made in the company of a friend referred to as Magdaline. She stated that the Appellant was her friend and neighbour and further about the escort to the police station and subsequent hospital visit, where she found out that she was pregnant. PW2, the complainant’s mother, testified that the chief caused the arrest of the Appellant and the complainant, who informed her that the Appellant was her boyfriend.






7.
PW3 was a Senior Assistant Chief of Kigio Sub Location. He testified that his involvement in the case resulted from the headteacher of Kigio Secondary School's communication that the complainant had run away from school. He told the court that the Appellant, a casual laborer in the area, went to his office following communication for him to do so and the discussions that took place on the relationship between the appellant and the complainant. He stated that the complainant was rescued from her grandmother’s house at Gitegi, the location disclosed by the Appellant, and escorted to the police station alongside the Appellant.






8.
PW4 was the investigating officer; she testified that the complainant reported that the appellant had defiled her against her will during a visit and further told the court about the subsequent referral to the hospital. PW5, a Clinical Officer at Kandara Level 4 Hospital, produced the medical notes and P3 form for the complainant herein. He stated that on examination, the hymen was broken, and the complainant was pregnant.






9.
In his defence, the Appellant told the court that he went to the Chief’s Office with his wife, Magdaline, after his employer told him that the Chief had summoned him. He denied the offence, stating that the complainant was his wife’s friend, not his own.






10.
I will first address the issue of voire dire. On 4
th
 December 2018, the trial court conducted a voire dire examination. The witness told the court she was 17 years’ old and would speak the truth. The learned trial magistrate was satisfied that the minor understood the nature of the oath and the duty of telling the truth. The complainant was not a child of tender years as to require voire dire. I am satisfied that the trial court employed the correct procedure in ascertaining the child's competence to give evidence.






11.
In Charles Wamukoya Karani Vs Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 72 of 2013, the Court highlighted the ingredients forming the offence of defilement;
“
The critical ingredients forming the offence of defilement are the age of the complainant, proof of penetration, and positive identification of the assailant.”






12.
The burden of proof rests with the prosecution to prove its case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. In Stephen Nguli Mulili vs Republic [2014] eKLR, it was held that: -
“
It is not in doubt that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. The locus classicus on this is the case of DPP V WOOLMINGTON, (1935) UKHL 1 where the court eloquently stated that the “golden thread” in the “web of English common law” is that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case. The Kenyan Courts have upheld this position in numerous cases. See Festus Mukati Murwa vs. R, [2013] eKLR.”






13.
The complainant and her mother testified about her age, which can be ascertained further from the evidence produced before the trial court (P.Exh. 3—Birth Certificate). I am satisfied that the first ingredient of the complainant's minority age was proved to the required standard.






14.
Turning to penetration, Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines penetration as follows:
“
The partial or complete insertion of the genital organ of a person into the genital organs of another person.”
Penetration can be proved through the victim’s sole testimony or the victim’s testimony corroborated by medical evidence.






15.
The complainant explained how she ended up at the Appellant’s house and what had transpired. She stated that she had sex with the Appellant after her friend, Magdaline, went home, and she was left behind. In observing the complainant's demeanour, the trial court recorded that the complainant was clear in her evidence and believable and found no reason for the complainant to frame the Appellant. There was no mention of anyone else being involved, and the evidence before the court was that the Appellant had sex with the complainant; there is no doubt about what was under reference. The complainant was a minor and lacked the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse.






16.
The events preceding the Appellant’s arrest, as narrated by the Assistant Chief, provided the nexus between the Appellant’s arrest and the commission of the offence and proved that there was no malice.






17.
The prosecution and the defence mentioned Magdaline in their testimonies. The Appellant claimed that Magdaline was his wife, and the Assistant Chief testified that the Appellant stated this while at the Chief’s Office. This is a valid reason for failure to call the witness, as the witness is under the Appellant's exclusive control.






18.
It is well established that a single witness's oral evidence is sufficient to warrant a conviction. See George Kioji Vs R Nyeri Criminal Appeal No. 270 of 2012 (unreported)]. The court held as follows:
“
Where available, medical evidence arising from examination of the accused and linking him to the defilement would be welcome. We however hasten to add that such medical evidence is not mandatory or even the only evidence upon which an accused person can properly be convicted for defilement. The court can convict if it is satisfied that there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the defilement was perpetrated by accused person. Indeed, under the proviso to section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya, a court can convict an accused person in a prosecution involving a sexual offence, on the evidence of the victim alone, if the court believes the victim and records the reasons for such belief.”






19.
The clinical officer testified that upon examination of the complainant, the hymen was broken, and she was pregnant. This corroborates the complainant's testimony, and I am satisfied that the learned trial court's conclusion on penetration was sound.






20.
The Appellant, in his defence raised the issue of DNA not having been conducted. In considering the absence of DNA results in a defilement case, the court stated in the case of Aml v Republic [2012] eKLR:
“
The fact of rape or defilement is not proved by way of a DNA test but by way of evidence.”






21.
In view of the foregoing, the Appellant's conviction was proper, given that the ingredients forming the offence of defilement were proved. The case was proved beyond reasonable doubt.






22.
I will now turn to the sentence. The trial court considered the Appellant’s mitigation and the social inquiry report dated 2
nd
 October, 2019 and sentenced the Appellant to 10 years’ imprisonment. Sentencing is the discretion of the trial court, and I find no basis upon which to interfere with the trial court’s decision on sentence. However, I note that the learned trial magistrate did not take into account the period the Appellant had been in custody during sentencing, as provided for under Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Appellant could not raise bond and remained in custody during the trial. The prison authorities shall take into account the period spent in custody, from his arrest on 9
th
 July, 2018 up to the date of his sentence on 9th October, 2019, in computing the sentence imposed on the Appellant.






23.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted with the sentence outlined in paragraph 
22
 of this Judgment.






24.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an appeal against conviction and sentence arising in Nyeri Law Courts Criminal Case S.O No. 50 of 2020 delivered on 12th August, 2021 by Hon. N.W. Kariuki, P.M.)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. The particulars of the offence are that; on 31
st
 August, 2020 at [Particulars Withheld], within Nyeri County, he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of SNW, a child aged 13 years. He was also charged with an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He was convicted on the main charge and sentenced to twenty (20) years’ imprisonment.






2.
In his amended grounds of appeal, the Appellant faulted the trial court’s decision on the grounds that the primary elements of the offence, including penetration, were not established. He argued that the prosecution evidence was riddled with discrepancies and pleaded that the statutory defence provided for under Section 8(5) and (6) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 applied in his favour.






3.
At the appeal hearing, the parties relied on the written submissions filed in court. The Appellant submitted that the respondent failed to discharge its legal and evidential burden and that consequently, the conviction and sentence should be set aside. On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that the appeal ought to be dismissed and the conviction and sentence upheld on the basis that the prosecution's evidence was substantive and sufficient to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt.






4.
In determining this appeal, this court being a first appellate court is alive to and considers the principles laid down in the case of Okeno vs Republic (1972) EA 32 where the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa stated that:
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be subjected to a fresh and exhaustive examination (Pandya V R 1975) EA 336 and to the appellate court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions (Shantilal M Ruwala VR [1957] EA 570. It is not the junction of a first appellate court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s findings and conclusions; it must make its own findings and draw its own conclusions. only then can it decide whether the magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, see (Peters V Sunday Post 1978) EA 424.”






5.
The prosecution called 5 witnesses in support of its case. PW1 was the Assistant Chief, Gichira sub-location. She stated that on 1
st
 September 2020, at about 5 a.m., she proceeded to the homestead of PW2’s brother after PW2 called her and complained of commotion in the said homestead. According to PW1, the Appellant was inside the house alongside the complainant and two others. The other two were identified as Collins, who was the caretaker and SM, a minor. PW1 narrated the subsequent report and investigations by the police. PW2 told the court that on the material date, he heard screams from his brother's house, where Collins, the caretaker, lived while his brother was staying in a school compound. He testified that when he gained access, Collins, the Appellant, and a girl were sitting on the bed. After that, he locked the door from outside and called the assistant chief -PW1. According to PW2, the presence of an additional girl was noted after PW1 had arrived; he maintained that his action was out of concern for the presence of the minors in the house during the wee hours of 4.40 a.m.






6.
PW3, a medical doctor, produced the P3 Form and post-rape care form that was prepared in respect of the complainant. He told the court that on examination, the hymen was broken and the minor’s private parts were inflamed.






7.
The complainant testified as PW4 after a voire dire examination was conducted by the trial court. She told the court that she was born on 30
th
 August, 2007 and was 13 years old. She testified that while in the company of SM, they met the Appellant and one Collins on a public road and accompanied them to the Appellant’s house, where they ate food and proceeded to Collin’s house at night. According to PW4, the Appellant, while undressed, ‘did bad manners’ to her as Collins and another girl (SM) left the room. She stated that later that night, the Appellant and Collins kept disturbing them through the window of the room they had placed a mattress on to lie down because they could not fit in one bed. According to PW4, a neighbour closed the door from outside before sunrise and thereafter, members of the public flocked to the homestead and assaulted them.






8.
The Appellant in his defence, told the court that on the material date, he was working at the the farm where he is employed alongside Luke (DW2). He stated that his presence at Collin’s house early in the morning was to collect a sprayer which he had lent him and that he needed to use in spraying livestock. According to the Appellant, while at Collin’s place, the complainant, in the company of another young girl, asked to be let in, and shortly afterwards, PW2 showed up and locked all of them inside the house. DW2, Luke, told the court that the Appellant had requested him to assist with farm work during the day on 31
st
 August, 2020 and that he slept at the Appellant’s house on that date. According to DW2, the Appellant woke up earlier than him on the said date. He stated that he was awakened by noise and found the Appellant and Collins being assaulted by a crowd.






9.
In George Opondo Olunga v Republic [2016] eKLR, it was stated that the ingredients of an offence of defilement are identification or recognition of the offender, penetration, and proof of the victim's age.






10.
The prosecution witnesses gave an account of the Appellant’s arrest, and the Appellant does not dispute that he was arrested at the house occupied by Collins’. It is not contested that the complainant was also in the same house at that time. The question is whether the complainant was defiled while in that house and by who.






11.
The proximity of the houses was given as so close that it is believable that PW2 was able to hear the movements in the house occupied by Collins. I have carefully examined the complainant’s testimony. The commotion stated by PW2 can be related to that stated by the complainant in her examination in chief. PW2 told the court that he sighted only one girl when he gained entry to the house, which corroborates the testimony of the complainant that she hid under the bed when a neighbour knocked at the door. The complainant gave an elaborate testimony of what had transpired during the day and how she ended up at that house. The sequence of events is believable and was not displaced in cross-examination.






12.
The trial court made an observation of the complainant’s demeanour in the judgment. I agree with the findings that the circumstances surrounding the presence of the complainant and SM in the house are as tendered by the prosecution. The trial court rightly rejected the defence that the Appellant had gone to the house that morning, as the evidence shows that his presence was earlier in the night and the alibi defence raised by DW2 at his house is an afterthought.






13.
As to what transpired in the house, the complainant used euphemisms to describe the sexual encounter. She explained that the person who defiled her removed his clothes and did bad manners to her. She testified in Kiswahili, translated to Kiswahili is ‘tabia mbaya’. Terms like ‘tabia mbaya’ have been interpreted to mean sexual intercourse when a child testifies in defilement cases. The proceedings before the trial court show that the trial magistrate observed that the complainant, when narrating the ordeal, became withdrawn, and the court had to prompt her to be audible.






14.
In Muganga Chilejo Saha v Republic [2017] eKLR the Court of Appeal stated as follows-
“
Naturally children who are victims of sexual abuse are likely to be devastated by the experience and given their innocence, they may feel shy, embarrassed and ashamed to relate that experience before people and more so in a court room. If the trend in the decided cases is anything to go by, courts in this country have generally accepted the use of euphemisms like, “alinifanyia tabia mbaya”, (IE V R, Kapenguria HC Cr Case No 11 of 2016), “he pricked me with a thorn from the front part of this body.”, (Samuel Mwangi Kinyati v R , Nanyuki HCCRA No 48 of 2015), “he used his thing for peeing”, (David Otieno Alex v R, Homa Bay HC Cr A
p No 44 of 2015
), “he inserted his ""dudu"" into my ""mapaja"", (Joses Kaburu v R, Meru HC Cr Case No 196 of 2016), “he used his munyunyu”, (Thomas Alugha Ndegwa, Nbi HC Cr. Appeal No 116 of 2011), as apt descriptions of acts of defilement. We, however, need to remind trial courts that the use of certain words and phrases like “he defiled me”, which are sometimes attributed to child victims, are inappropriate, technical and unlikely to be used by them in their testimony. See A M M v R Voi HC Cr Ap
p No 35 of 2014
, EMM V R Mombasa HC Cr Case No 110 of 2015, among several others. Trial courts should record as nearly as possible what the child says happened to him or her.""






15.
'Penetration' is defined under Section 2 of the act to mean 'the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person'. I am persuaded that the reference to bad manners by the complainant meant penetration into her vagina by a penis.






16.
In the case of George Kioji vs. R - Nyeri Criminal Appeal No. 270 of 2012 (unreported) the court held that:-
“
Where available, medical evidence arising from examination of the accused and linking him to the defilement would be welcome. We however hasten to add that such medical evidence is not mandatory or even the only evidence upon which an accused person can properly be convicted for defilement. The court can convict if it is satisfied that there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the defilement was perpetrated by accused person. Indeed, under the proviso to section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya, a court can convict an accused person in a prosecution involving a sexual offence, on the evidence of the victim alone, if the court believes the victim and records the reasons for such belief.”






17.
The first medical examination was done on 1
st
 September 2020, a day after the incident, and the second medical examination, when filling in the P3 form on 7
th
 September 2020, was within a week. The fact that no spermatozoa were seen does not mean that there was no penetration. In the present case, the medical records produced corroborated the testimony of the complainant that there was penetration.






18.
The trial magistrate observed that the complainant gave a clear account of the incident on how the appellant had sexual intercourse with her. The complainant’s evidence of the person who defiled her was that of recognition. There was only one other man in the house besides the appellant, Collins. There is no doubt about who the complainant referred to as between the Appellant and Collins.  She told the court that they took turns using the bed and that Collins and SM. also had sexual intercourse.






19.
Regarding the complainant's age, a birth certificate was produced in court indicating that she was born on 30
th
 August 2007. Thus, the complainant was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the offence.






20.
The Appellant, in his submissions, raised the issue of the complainant's age, raising a defence under Section 8 (5) and (6) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, which provides as follows;
(5)
“It is a defence to a charge under this section if—
(a)
it is proved that such child, deceived the accused person into believing that he or she was over the age of eighteen years at the time of the alleged commission of the offence; and
(b)
the accused reasonably believed that the child was over the age of eighteen years.
(6)
The belief referred to in subsection (5)(b) is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps the accused person took to ascertain the age of the complainant.”






21.
This defence was not raised in the proceedings before the trial court. If the Appellant relied on the defence of age under Section 8(5), then the evidential burden of proof would shift to him to prove that there was deception and that he took the necessary steps to ascertain the complainant’s age. In his defence, the appellant referred to the complainant and SM. as young girls. There was no evidence of deceit or steps taken to ascertain the complainant’s age.






22.
I am persuaded that the trial court correctly addressed the issue of the standard and burden of proof in this case. The learned magistrate arrived at the correct findings, and the conviction was proper and supported by the law and the evidence.






23.
On sentence, under Section 8 (3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years. The trial court considered the Appellant’s mitigation and the social inquiry report dated 23
rd
 September, 2021 and sentenced the Appellant to 20 years’ imprisonment. I find no basis upon which to interfere with the trial court’s decision on sentence. However, I note that the learned trial magistrate did not consider the period the Appellant had been in custody during sentencing as stipulated under Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Appellant could not raise bond and remained in custody through the trial. The prison authorities shall take into account the period spent in custody, from his arrest on 2
nd
 September, 2020 up to the date of his sentence on 23
rd
 September, 2021 in computing the sentence imposed on the Appellant.






24.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted with the sentence outlined in paragraph 
23
 of this Judgment.






25.
It is so ordered.

Respondent










Judgment










1.
The Appellant filed a claim against the Respondent vide Milimani Small Claims Court Claim No. E1368 of 2022 where he sought judgment against the Respondent for Kshs 550,000/=. The court dismissed the claim for the Appellant’s non-attendance on 25
th
 May, 2022. The Appellant filed an application for reinstatement of his claim against the Respondent, but the application was also dismissed by the lower court on 8
th
 July, 2022. Subsequently, the Appellant filed a fresh claim vide Milimani Small Claims Court Claim No. E4677 of 2022 in an attempt to have his matter heard and decided on merit. In this new claim, the Appellant sought the very orders he had sought in the dismissed suit, including a claim of Kshs. 550, 000/=. The trial court dismissed the claim.






2.
The Appellant was dissatisfied by the ruling of the court and filed a Memorandum of Appeal dated 5
th
 July, 2023 seeking to have his suit reinstated at the lower court. He listed three grounds of appeal, namely:
“
(a)
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in dismissing the Appellant’s Statement of Claim without hearing and determining the same.
(b)
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in dismissing all the      subsequent applications made by the Appellant in an attempt to reinstate      the said claims.
(c)
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in denying the      appellant his right to be heard as the right to be heard is a constitutional      right of the appellant.
(d)
The appeal was canvased by way of written submissions which this
court gave due consideration’.






The Appellant’s Case


3.
The Appellant argues that the learned magistrate erred when she dismissed the Appellant’s claim against the Respondent without hearing them on merit. He submitted that the lower court failed to give adequate reasons for denying the appellant his fundamental right to fair hearing. The appellant seeks that the court set aside the ruling of the subordinate court and substitute it with an order reinstating the suit.






4.
The respondent opposed the appeal. She argued that the chronological events that led to the dismissal of the suit suggest that the appellant was not keen to prosecute the matter and thus occasioned the previous dismissals. She also argued that the appeal is incurably and hopelessly incompetent and defective, and hence this Honorable Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear and determine it. She argued that the record of appeal was incomplete because it does not contain a certified copy of the typed proceedings of the trial court.






5.
In addition, the respondent submitted that the instant appeal is incompetent for having being filed by an advocate or firm of advocates that has not properly come on record for the Appellant in these proceedings, contrary to the provisions of Order 9, Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules. She argued that the Trial Court did not err in disallowing the Appellant’s Applications for Review. She opines that the trial court dismissed the Appellant’s Statement of Claim after hearing the same on merit and hence it did not err or violate the Appellant’s Constitutional Rights to be heard.








Analysis And Determination


6.
I have considered the grounds contained in the memorandum of appeal and the rival submissions by the parties. The appeal from the Small Claims Court is on issues of law only. Section 38 of the Small Claims Court provides that:-
“
SUBPARA -38. (1)
A person aggrieved by the decision or an order Appeals. of the Court may appeal against that decision or order to the High Court on matters of law.
(2)
An appeal from any decision or order referred to in subsection (1) shall be final.”






7.
The issues for determination are as follows:








Whether the instant appeal is competently before this Honorable Court


8.
The Respondent submitted that the record of appeal as prepared by the appellant does not include certified copies of the lower court’s typed proceedings. The Respondent argued that there is nothing to guide this court on how the lower court arrived at its findings, and that the appeal out to be struck out. The Respondent cited several precedents to support her position.






9.
I have perused the documents before me and I agree with the respondents that the Appellant’s record of appeal does not contain a certified copy of the typed proceedings of the trial court. In addition, there is no evidence on record showing that the Appellant herein even requested for a copy of the typed proceedings of the trial court.






10.
However, it is clear to me that the original file of the lower court together with typed copied of proceedings and judgment were forwarded to this court vide a letter dated 18
th
 August 2023. The file was available to me for perusal. There is then no substance in this argument.






11.
This is also supported by the High Court’s decision in Adan Chuda Sode v Madina Oshe Jira & another [2021] eKLR, where the court entertained an appeal despite the fact that initial record of appeal did not include the typed proceedings of the lower court. In the case, the typed copies of proceedings were forwarded later to the High Court vide a letter. The Court in Adan Chuda Sode v Madina Oshe Jira & another observed thus;
“
Mr. [Advocate] argued the appeal should be struck out as the record of appeal        did not include the typed proceedings of the lower court. It is however clear that        the original file of the lower court together with typed copies of proceedings and        judgment were forwarded to this court vide a letter dated 5th February 2021. The        file was available to me for perusal. There is then no substance in this argument.






12.
The Respondents also submitted that the instant appeal is incompetent for having been filed by an advocate or firm of advocates that has not properly come on record for the Appellant in these proceedings. He argues that the upshot it that the memorandum of appeal and the entire record of appeal should be struck out. He cited numerous decided cases, and Order 9 Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules to support his argument.






13.
However, I am not persuaded by the Respondent’s argument that the Advocates for the Appellant are improperly on record. I also do not agree with her argument that the Appellant had to file a consent between the outgoing and incoming advocates or file an application to seek leave of the Court to come on record.






14.
The prevailing jurisprudence is that Order 9 Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules does not apply in instances of an appeal because the advocate’s instructions in a lower court are exhausted at the conclusion of a matter.






15.
In Francis Omondi Odhiambo v Hippolitus Omondi Ochieng [2022] eKLR, the Environment and Land Court held thus;
“


17.
In my considered view and as has been held in various court decisions and rightly posited by the respondent, the intent of Order 9 Rule 9 and 10 of the Civil Procedure Rules was to cure the mischief of litigants sacking their advocates at the execution stage or at the point of filing their bill of costs thus denying their advocates their hard-earned fees. Had this court been the first court of call, I would not have hesitated but upheld that once judgement has been rendered, leave has to be sought from the trial court.






18.
However, the scenario is different in the instant, this court is sitting as an appellate court. Does one need to seek leave in such circumstances? Bearing in mind the provisions of Section 1A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 ….that courts have to ensure that cases are conducted in a manner that are just and expeditious. It is my view that Order 9 Rule 9 and 10 of the Civil Procedure Rules does not apply in instances of an appeal because the advocate’s instructions in a lower court are exhausted at the conclusion of a matter and requiring such leave would be tantamount to denying such an appellant a right to legal representation of his choice at an appellate stage thus negating the intent of just and expeditious disposal of a dispute”.








16.
The Court of Appeal in the case of Tobias M. Wafubwa v Ben Butali [2017] eKLR held that;
“
Once a judgment is entered, save for matters such as applications for review or        execution or stay of execution inter alia, an appeal to an appellate court is not a        continuation of proceedings in the lower court, but a commencement of new        proceedings in another court, … Parties should therefore have the right to choose        whether to remain with the same counsel or to engage other Counsel on appeal        without being required to file a Notice of Change of Advocates or to obtain leave        from the concerned court to be placed on record in substitution of the previous        Advocate”.






17.
I am also persuaded by the decision of the Environment and Land Court in 
Koske v Langat (Environment and Land Appeal E005 of 2021
) [2023] KEELC 21958 (KLR) (30 November 2023) (Ruling), where the court held that;
“
The Applicant herein has submitted that an Appeal process represented an        independent and distinct legal procedure, particularly when considering the        intent and purpose behind Rule 9 of Order 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules. I am        fully persuaded of the correctness of the said submissions, indeed where a firm of        Advocates had acted for a party in the lower court, those instructions are        terminated and/or are spent or exhausted with the conclusion of the trial in the        lower court. An appeal is different ball game; it can be filed by any other firm of        Advocates on instructions of the Appellant without necessarily having to file        Notice of Change of Advocates or filing an application to come on record in        place of the previous Advocates. However, in the present scenario, by seeking        stay of execution of the orders of the trial court, in effect is not related to an        independent Appeal but to a suit that was that is ongoing. The provision of the        law envisages a situation like this one where after judgment has been entered, a        new Advocate desires to come on record for purposes of applying for stay of        execution or to proceed with the execution proceedings in the previous suit. This        scenario is different from one where an incoming Counsel directly files his        Appeal (fresh proceedings) challenging the decision by the lower court”.






18.
In the instant case, the Appellant is not applying for stay of execution or to proceed with the execution proceedings in the previous suit. The incoming Counsel has directly filed his Appeal (fresh proceedings) challenging the decision by the lower court. Thus, I hold that the memorandum of Appeal and the record of appeal filed by the firm of Keengwe & Co. Advocates are competent and properly filed.








Whether the Lower Court erred in disallowing the Appellant’s Application for Review dated 10
th
 June, 2022


19.
The next issue for consideration is whether the trial court did err in disallowing the Appellant’s application for Review dated 10
th
 June, 2022 in which he sought to have the claim that the court had dismissed for non-attendance reinstated. The trial Court heard the said application, and upon considering the grounds supporting the said application, the trial court was unsatisfied by the grounds advanced thereon and dismissed the said application.






20.
The general legal principle is that in a first appeal, the duty if the court is to analyze and re-evaluate the evidence adduced at the lower court and draw its own conclusions. This Honorable Court is, therefore, required, as was also stated by the Court in Selle and Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Company Limited & 2 Others (1968) EA 123 to ‘reconsider the evidence, evaluate itself and draw its own conclusion.’






21.
I have re-looked at the Appellant’s Notice of Motion dated 10
th
 June, 2022, together with the Supporting Affidavit sworn by Samuel Keengwe dated the same day, and filed in court on 23
rd
 June, 2023. In the affidavit, the Appellant states that the initial hearing date was scheduled because the date was declared a Public Holiday. He also states that he did not attend because the Advocate how was acting on his behalf failed to check the Judiciary E-portal to furnish him with the new hearing dates.






22.
I have also read the Respondent’s replying affidavit sworn by Amina Mohamed on 24
th
 June 2022, in which she sought to oppose the Appellants application for reinstatement. She stated that the e-filing system has an automatic way of communicating new dates to the respective parties through their emails and text messages and thus the Appellant’s Advocate could not have missed the notification.






23.
The record of the lower court indicates that the court did not discuss at length the merit if the Appellant’s application. Despite the lengthy affidavits and submissions submitted before it, the court did not particularly address itself on the merit or demerit of the application. The entire ruling of the Lower court dated 8
th
 July 2022 was as follows;
“
It is my considered view that the reasons advanced by the Applicant are not        plausible. I find that the application has failed to meet the threshold for        reinstatement since upon perusal of the court record, I have noted that the        Claimant has been indolent. The claim herein was filed on 15
th
 March 2022. Time        has already lapsed due to the strict timelines wherein matters before this court        are to be heard and determined within the 60 day’s timelines as envisaged under        the SCC Act. I find that the notice of motion application dated 10
th
 June 2022 is        devoid of merit. It is dismissed with costs.






24.
Upon my evaluation of the evidence on record, I have formed the opinion that the Lower court erred in disallowing the Appellant’s allocation for review dated 10
th
 June 2022, because the mistake was largely caused by his advocate. This is in line with numerous court decisions that have held that courts should not punish litigants for the mistakes of their advocates.






25.
The High Court in the case of Geoffrey Oguna & another v Mohamed Yusuf Osman & 2 others [2022] eKLR held thus;
“
This Court is of the view that in the interest of justice, the mistake of the        Advocate who had conduct of the matter in the lower Court should not be        visited on the applicants herein.






26.
In the case of CFC Stanbic Limited versus John Maina Githaiga & another [2013] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held as follows:-
“
On the issue of the mistake of counsel, it is not in dispute that the appellant gave instructions to its advocates in good time once it was served with the pleadings and summons to enter appearance. Therefore, the failure to enter appearance and file a defence is clearly attributable to its advocate who failed to enter appearance and file defence in good time. This being the mistake of counsel, the same ought not to be visited upon the appellant. This Court is guided by the case of Lee G Muthoga V Habib Zurich Finance (k) Ltd & Another, Civil Application No. NAI 236 OF 2009, where this Court held: ""It's a widely accepted principle of law that a litigant should not suffer because of his advocate's oversight."" In the instant appeal, we are of the view that the appellant should not suffer because of the mistakes of its counsel.""






27.
Similarly, the court in Tana & Athi Rivers Development Authority v Jeremiah Kimigho Mwakio & 3 Others [2015] eKLR, held that mistakes of counsel should not be visited on an innocent litigant. It held;
“
From past decisions of this court, it is without doubt that courts will readily        excuse a mistake of counsel if it affords a justiciable, expeditious and holistic        disposal of a matter. However, it is to be noted that the exercise of such        discretion is by no means automatic. While acknowledging that mistake of        counsel should not be visited on a client, it should be remembered that unsel’s        duty is not limited to his client; he has a corresponding duty to the court in        which he practices and even to the other side.”






28.
In the case of Belinda Muras & 6 Others –vs- Amos Wainaina [1978] KLR in which Hon Madan JIA (as) he then was defined what constitutes a mistake as follows:-
“
A mistake is a mistake. It is no less a mistake because it is an unfortunate        step. It is no less pardonable because it is committed by senior counsel. Though        in the case of junior counsel court might feel compassionate more readily. A        blunder on a point of law can be a mistake. The door of justice is not closed        because of a mistake has been made by a lawyer of experience who ought to        know better. The court may not condone it but ought certainly to do whatever is        necessary to rectify if the interest of justice so dictate.” [own emphasis]






29.
Similarly, in Phillip Chemwolo & Another –vs- Augustine Kubede [1982-88] KLR 103 at 1040 Apaloo, J.A as he then was stated thus:-
“
Blunders will continue to be made from time to time and it does not follow that        because a mistake has been made that a party should suffer the penalty of not    having his case heard on merit”. [own emphasis]






30.
It is also not lost to the court that dismissal of a suit is a draconian act that drives a litigant away from the seat of justice and as such, discretion ought to be exercised judiciously. This position was amplified in the case John Nahashon Mwangi vs Kenya Finance Bank Limited (in Liquidation) [2015] eKLR as follows: -
“
Courts should sparingly dismiss suits for want of prosecution for dismissal is a draconian act which drives away the plaintiff in an arbitrary manner from the seat of judgment. Such acts are comparable only to the proverbial ‘Sword of the Damocles’ which should only draw blood where it is absolutely necessary.”






31.
In the case of Wachira Karani vs. Bildad Wachira (2016) eKLR as was quoted in the case of David Gicheru v Gicheha Farms Limited & another [2020] eKLR the Court held that: -
“
“The fundamental duty of the Court is to do justice between the parties. It is in        turn, fundamental that to that duty, those parties should each be allowed a        proper opportunity to put their cases upon the merits of the matter…”








Conclusion


32.
In the circumstances of this case, there was no reason grave enough that would warrant the locking out of the appellant from pursuing its claim and allowing the trial to proceed to its logical conclusion. The interest of justice warrants this Court’s intervention. In the circumstances, I take the view that the error of the appellant’s Advocate on record ought not be visited upon him by denying the Appellant an opportunity to canvass their Claim on merit.






33.
Therefore, and in the interests of justice I am inclined to allow the Appellant’s Appeal presented by the Memorandum of Appeal dated 5
th
 July 2023. Subsequently, the Lower Court’s order dated 25
th
 May 2022 dismissing the Appellant’s Claim E1368 of 2022 suit for non-attendance is hereby set aside and the Claim is reinstated. The SCC court will issue a mention date for directions as to hearing within 14 days of the date herein.






34.
That the Advocates for the Appellant, Keengwe &Company Advocates, do pay the Respondent throw away costs of Ksh.20,000/- to be made within 14 days of the date herein.






35.
No order as to Costs of the Appeal.

Between

Appellant




and




Jacob Iringu Wanjagi Mwangi


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the Judgment and Decree of Hon. G. Sogomo, Principal Magistrate, delivered on 30th November, 2021 in Milimani C.M. Civil Suit No. E5842 of 2020)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Respondent, a motorcyclist, got involved in a road traffic accident on 5
th
 July, 2019 while crossing Harambee Avenue in Nairobi. He was knocked down by a motor vehicle registration Number KBT 598K belonging to the Appellant. He sustained several injuries and sued the Appellant by instituting Milimani Commercial Courts Civil Case Number E5842 of 2020, under which he claimed damages for pain, suffering, and loss of amenities.






2.
On 28
th
 October, 2021, parties recorded consent on liability in the ratio of 85:15 in favor of the Respondent as against the Appellant. The consent also settled that the injuries sustained by the Respondent be deemed as:-
(a)
Right shoulder rotator cuff tear,
(b)
Blunt injury on the right knee, and
(c)
16.5% permanent incapacity.






3.
The trial court awarded the Respondent general damages for pain and loss of Kshs.1,000,000/=; and general damages for diminished capacity of Kshs.500,000/=. After subtracting the Respondent’s 15% contribution, the court awarded him Kshs.1,279,632.50/=. The Appellant, being aggrieved by the said judgment, appealed to this court through a Memorandum of Appeal dated 13
th
 January, 2022 in which she listed four grounds, namely;
a.
That the learned trial magistrate proceeded on wrong principles when assessing damages to be awarded to the respondent herein, if any, and failed to apply precedents and tenets of the law applicable.
b.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and, in fact, by awarding a sum in respect of general damages which was inordinately high in the circumstances occasioning a miscarriage of justice; and
c.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in law and, in fact, in finding that the plaintiff was entitled to general damages of Kshs.1,500,000/= which was manifestly excessive in view of the injuries suffered by the respondent.
d.
The Learned Trial Magistrate erred in Law and, in fact, by failing to consider the Appellant’s submissions and judicial authorities on quantum, thereby arriving at an erroneous figure on quantum.






4.
The appeal was canvased through written submissions, for which this court gave due consideration.






The Appellant’s Case


5.
The Appellant submitted that the damages awarded by the trial court were not commensurable with the injuries sustained. She proposed that this court quash the award of Kshs.1,500,000/= as general damages and reduce it to Kshs.400,000/= as general damages. She submitted that 400,000/= reflects the nature and gravity of the injuries in this case and the circumstances. She relied on Coast Broadway Co. Ltd v Elizabeth Alaka Achebi [2015] eKLR, John Wambua v Mathew Makau Mwololo and Another [2020] eKLR, and Patrick Kinoti Miguna v Peter Mburunga Muthama [2014] eKLR, where the Appellant courts awarded accident victims Kshs. 300,000/=, Kshs. 120, 000/=, and Kshs. 300 000/= respectively.








The Respondent’s Case


6.
The Respondent submitted that the award made was reasonable based on the evidence on record. Accordingly, he submitted that there is no basis to disturb the award and urged this court to affirm the awards. He further submitted that re-evaluating and re-assessing the evidence and proceedings on record would show that the trial court appreciated the evidence adduced and applied the correct principles.








Issue for Determination


a. Whether the award of general damages of Kshs.1,500,000/= in light of the injuries is inordinately high to persuade the court to interfere with it.


Analysis and Determination


7.
This being the first appellate court, it has a duty to re-evaluate the evidence and come up with its conclusions but also bear in mind that it should not interfere with the findings of the trial court unless the same were based on no evidence or on misapprehension of the evidence or the trial court applied the wrong principles in reaching its findings. The exercise of this duty must be within the principles set out in Selle and another v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd and Others [1968] 1 EA 123:
“
…this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence ...”






8.
Further, this being an appeal on quantum, the court is guided by the principles set out by the Court of Appeal in Kemfro Africa Limited t/a “Meru Express Services [1976]” & Another v Lubia & Another (No 2) [1985] eKLR
“
The principles to be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the quantum of damages awarded by a trial Judge were held by the former Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa to be that it must be satisfied that either that the Judge, in assessing the damages, took into account an irrelevant factor, or left out of account a relevant one, or that, short of this, the amount is so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.”






9.
These principles were later restated by the Court of Appeal in Catholic Diocess of Kisumu v Sophia Achieng Tete- Kisumu Civil Appeal No. 284 of 2001, where the court held as follows:-
“
It is trite law that the assessment of general damages is at the discretion of the trial court and an Appellate Court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded by the Court below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. The Appellate Court can justifiably interfere with the quantum of damages awarded by the trial court only if it is satisfied that the trial court applied the wrong principles (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one) or misapprehended the evidence and so arrived at a figure so inordinately high or low as to present an entirely erroneous estimate.”






10.
In the case of Morris Mugambi v Isaiah Gitiru [2014] eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated as follows:
“
………we wish to state that in assessment of damages the general method of approach should be that comparable injuries should, as far as possible be compensated by comparable awards keeping in mind the correct level of awards in similar cases.”






11.
After reviewing the cases cited by the parties, I noted that the authorities referenced by the Appellant involve less severe injuries compared to those in the current case.
In Coast Broadway Co. Ltd v Elizabeth Alaka Achebi [2015] eKLR, the accident victim had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder joint.
In John Wambua vs Mathew Makau Mwololo and Another [2020] eKLR, the plaintiff sustained a blunt injury to the right shoulder and a blunt injury to the right big toe. He was treated as an outpatient and was put on painkillers.
Lastly, in the case of Patrick Kinoti Miguna v Peter Mburunga Muthama [2014] eKLR, the Plaintiff suffered bruises on the right parietal region, loose lower incisors, a dislocation of the right shoulder, a cut on the left leg, a bruise on the right leg, and a bruise on the dorsum of the right hand.






12.
I reviewed the court’s decision in Roy Mackenzie v Cartrack Kenya Limited & Another [2012] eKLR, where the High Court awarded the plaintiff Kshs.700, 000/= as general damages. A comparison between the two cases (Roy Mackenzie and the current case) shows that the victims in both instances suffered similar injuries and underwent similar medical procedures. In Roy Mackenzie's case, the victim sustained an injury to his left shoulder and a tear of the rotator cuff tendon that required urgent arthroscopic correction. In the current case, the Respondent went through the same experience. According to the medical opinion dated 30
th
 July, 2020, and produced in court by consent of the parties, the Respondent’s MRI ‘showed major abnormalities of the right shoulder rotator cuff…..and underwent repair of the rotator cuff through arthroscopy.’






13.
I also reviewed the decision of the High Court in Erick Nyarangi Ondora & another v JMO & 3 Others [2019] eKLR. In this case, the court awarded the plaintiff Kshs.1,200,000/= in general damages. Liability was apportioned 85:15 in favor of the Respondent/Plaintiffs, with 16.5% permanent disability. The two cases can be differentiated. In the Erick Nyarangi Ondora case, the victim had suffered a compound fracture and was expected to incur future medical expenses and costs of Kshs.100,000/=. In contrast, the Respondent in the current case suffered less severe injuries. In addition, he is not expected to incur future costs concerning the injuries, and if anything, he did not plead for future expenses in the plaint.








14.
Taking the above comparable authorities into account as well as the nature and extent of the injuries sustained, the degree of permanent incapacity, and the inflationary trends, I find that while the learned trial magistrate considered comparable authorities, the award arrived at fell on the higher side and ought to be interfered with. I find that an award of Kshs.700,000/= would be reasonable in the circumstances.










Damages for Diminished Capacity


15.
In the Plaint dated 13
th
 October, 2020, the Respondent pleaded damages for reduced/diminished earning capacity. He stated;
“
6.
As a result of the accident, the Plaintiff sustained incapacitating injuries at the age of 40 years and due to the said injuries he can no longer engage effectively in any economic venture and his ability to compete effectively in the labour market has been severely curtailed and he claims damages for reduced/diminished earning capacity.”






16.
In the case of Alpharama Limited v Joseph Kariuki Cebron [2017] eKLR it was stated as follows on the method of awarding diminished earning capacity:-
“
The court would be properly entitled to make a global award because there is a general agreement in decisions rendered by courts that there is no formula for assessing damages for lost or diminished earning capacity provided the judge takes into account relevant factors.”






17.
I have perused the trial court’s record, and it appears that the Magistrate erred by referring to the wrong percentage of permanent incapacity in determining damages for diminished capacity. In the consent terms recorded by the parties on 28
th
 October, 2021, one of the mutually agreed terms was that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff be deemed as 16.5% incapacity. The records of the lower court reads:
“
By Consent, …..(2) The injuries sustained by the plaintiff be deemed as: (c) 16.5% permanent incapacity.”






18.
In the judgment, however, the magistrate quoted a different percentage. The court said:
“
Going by opinions in the medical records aforesaid, the court observes that the Plaintiff suffered 18% permanent incapacity of right shoulder.”






19.
The Court did not have to revisit the issue of the percentage of permanent incapacity because that issue had been settled by consent. The essence of the consent was that the parties had moved away from their pleadings and had recalibrated and narrowed the scope of the dispute to the issue of damages.






20.
I adopt the decision of the High Court in SNI v AOF [2020] eKLR, where the court observed as follows;
“
Prudence, indeed will dictate that parties legal effect deprived from the consent orders should be deliberately be bound unless there is evidence that every material fact in their possession was invariably mistaken or misrepresented to warrant a variation or complete setting aside the order. It is integral as the Court held in Flora N. Wasike v Destinno Wamboko [1988] eKLR that:
“It is now settled law that a consent Judgment or order has a contractual effect and can only be set aside on grounds which would justify setting a contract aside, or if certain conditions remain to be fulfilled, which are not carried out. (See the decision in J. M. Mwakio v Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd CA No. 28 of 1982).”






21.
Similarly, the Court in the case of Windsor Commercial Land Company Ltd & others v Century National Merchant Bank Trust Ltd. SCCA 114/2005:-
“
The Court will not interfere or disturb a consent order between the parties other than on those grounds in which it would interfere with any other contract. These would include mistake, misrepresentation, duress, and undue influence.”






22.
Thus, the Magistrate applied the wrong facts in assessing the damages for diminished capacity to the extent that she referred to the wrong percentage. I therefore set aside the 500,000/= damages awarded for diminished capacity.






23.
In determining the amount of damages to award in this category, I refer to the case of 
Nyatogo v Mini Bakeries Limited (Civil Appeal E38 of 2021
) [2023] KEHC 1593 (KLR) where the court awarded the plaintiff, who had suffered permanent incapacity of 32.5%, Kshs.800,000/= as damages for diminished capacity. In the case, the Judge observed that the percentage of permanent incapacity was a factor in determining the amount of the damages. It held;
“
I would thus award an additional global figure of Kshs 800,000/- bearing in mind what he used to earn before the accident and considering that the two doctors’ assessment of permanent incapacity varied and ranged between 15% to 50%.”






24.
In the current case, the Respondent suffered permanent incapacity of 16.5%, half of what the Plaintiff in Nyatogo v Mini Bakeries Limited had suffered.






25.
I also refer to the case of Ndung’u & Another v Mbau [2023] KEHC 26167 (KLR), where the High Court awarded the Plaintiff, who had suffered 37.5% permanent incapacity, Kshs.500,000/- as damages for diminished capacity. Taking into account these distinguishing factors, I find that Kshs. 300, 000/= in damages for diminished capacity will be reasonable.






26.
Accordingly, I allow this appeal on quantum and set aside the award of Kshs. 1,500,000/- general damages awarded to the Respondent by the trial court and substitute it with an award of Kshs. 1,000,000/= plus special damages as proved and not challenged on appeal in the sum of Kshs. 5,450/=. Liability is apportioned in the parties' agreed-upon ratio of 15%.
a.
General damages
I. Pain and suffering - Kshs.700,000/=
II. Diminished capacity - Kshs.300,000/=
Sub-total I - Kshs.1,000,000/=
Less 15% contribution - Kshs.150,000/-
Sub-total II - Kshs.850,000/=
b.
Special damages - Kshs.5,450/=
Total- Kshs.855,450/=






27.
Costs are at the court's discretion and, in any event, to a successful party. However, in this case, I order that each party bear its own cost of this Appeal as the appeal was only on quantum and the fact that the Respondent’s costs, as awarded in the trial court, are considerably reduced because of the reduction of the general damages by Kshs.500,000/= in this appeal.
Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
On 30
th
 July 2024, the convict Brucky Achieng Magak was sentenced to pay cumulative fines of Kshs.15,000 in default to serve one (1) year imprisonment on two counts of stealing contrary to Section 268 of the Penal Code and creating disturbance in a manner likely to cause breach of the peace.






2.
The sentences of one (1) year and 90 days respectively were to run concurrently.






3.
This was vide Winam SPM Criminal Case No. E207 of 2024. The convict is serving prison term because she is unable to raise the fines.






4.
From the presentence report dated 29
th
 July 2024, the convict is a 27 years old single lady. She was found to be mentally unstable although no mental assessment report was ordered on her. She is a first offender. She lived in Kisumu but her home is in Homabay. She was orphaned and suffered from financial distress and hardship, fending for her siblings.






5.
In view of the revelation that the convict was mentally unstable, it was the duty of the trial court to order for mental assessment report to establish whether the offences were committed involuntarily or voluntarily.






6.
I do not have a conclusive mental assessment report on the convict, either. The sentence imposed is short and the offender is a first offender.






7.

She told the Court she was examined and asked to go to the police station. She stated that the following day the went to Langas Police station and thereafter to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. She told the Court that she and the Appellant were facing each other when the act was committed, that he removed his pant and that she was born on 13/11/2007.






11.
PW4 was No.61309 Sergeant Magarine Jepkorir Kipyego attached to the Langas Police Station. She testified that on 17/12/2019 a report was made at the Station by PW1 accompanied by PW3 for defilement. She told the Court that she recorded the statements and issued a P3 Firm and also referred the complainant to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. She stated that on 18/12/2019 she went to Mosoriot Police Station to pick the Appellant who had attempted to flee but the Mosoriot officers managed to arrest him. She told the Court that she then recorded his statement and thereafter charged him.






12.
PW5 was Dr. Irene Simiyu, she testified that she works at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital where she works with Dr. Taban and is familiar with her handwriting and signature. She told the Court that Dr. Taban saw the complainant and on examination she had changed clothing and that the complainant narrated that she was going to milk when the Appellant pulled her and carried her to the store and defiled her and that he threatened to kill her if she screamed. On examination her head, neck, stomach, back, lower limbs were normal, her private parts healed, hymnal tears, 3 and 9 o’clock, confluence of vestibule, redness of vulva, had whitish discharge, HIV test was negative, pregnancy test was negative urinalysis was normal and syphilis was negative. She told the Court that the doctor opined that the minor had been defiled and then proceeded to fill the P3 Form which was signed and stamped on 18/12/2019.








Defence Evidence


13.
At the close of the prosecution case, the trial Court made a finding that there was a case to answer and put the accused to his defence. The defence was based on the sole unsworn testimony of the Appellant. He basically denied all the charges levelled against him and prayed for leniency.








The submissions


14.
Both parties filed their respective submissions. The Appellant filed his submissions on 22/2/2024 whereas the Respondent filed on 20/2/2024.








The Appellant’s Submissions


15.
Counsel for the Appellant, Mr. Martim submitted that the charge sheet was defective. He argued that the offence as framed in Count one read subsection 8 (1) (3) which is an non-existence provision of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. Counsel relied on the provision of Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He argued that the trial Court ought to have the acquitted the accused person on the basis that the offence as captured in the charge sheet was not known in law.






16.
With regard to the evidence tendered, Counsel submitted that the complainant (PW3) testified that “ He forcefully removed my trouser and also removed his trouser, I asked him to leave me alone, he wanted to defile me but we struggled and when my cousin called me, he left me and I ran” Counsel submitted that the accused then goes ahead to retell what she recorded in her statement. Counsel maintains that there was no actus reus for the offence of defilement. Counsel argued that as per the testimony of the victim, no penetration took place. According to Counsel the nature of such an offence is such that it is shrouded with stigma and that there is pressure to nail the perpetrator and the societal pressure to exert pressure to whoever is accused to be convicted. Counsel maintained that the Appellant did not commit the offence of defilement as framed in the charge sheer and that the elements of defilement were not proved. Counsel argued that the burden of proof in criminal cases lies with the prosecution and that this burden never shifts. Counsel referred the Court to the case of Alex Chemwotei V Republic in that regard. Counsel further argued that a medical report cannot be used to resuscitate a dead case.






17.
Counsel also referred the Court to the following cases; Okeno v republic [1972] EA and Kiilu & Another v Republic [2005] 1 KLR 174.








The Respondent’s Submissions


18.
State Counsel Mr. Mugun, submitted that the main issues for determination are; whether the conviction is supported by evidence and whether the conviction is legal. With regard to proof that the complainant was a child Counsel submitted that the complainant’s birth certificate was produced in evidence which shows that her date of birth is 13/11/2007 and therefore as at 16/12/2019 she was 12 years old. Counsel argued that the Appellant was the complainant’s relative and if there was evidence to contrary, he would have alluded to it in cross-examination but he did not do so, as such he knew the complainant’s age.






19.
With regard to proof of penetration, Counsel submitted that the Appellant partially inserted his manhood into her genitalia and that as he was doing so he heard PW2 calling out the complainant’s name and that is how she freed herself from his grip and rushed towards PW2. Counsel further submitted that PW5, Dr. Irene Simiyu testified that when the complainant was examined, her genitalia had healed hymenal tears at 3 and 9 o’clock positions, there was also confluence of the vestibule which all drove her to conclude that the minor had been defiled. Counsel argued that these findings corroborate the testimony of the complainant that she was defiled.






20.
With regard to positive identification of the Appellant, Counsel submitted that PW1 testified that the Appellant is her cousin and that in cross-examination she confirmed that the complainant knew the Appellant very well and that PW5 on her part testified that the complainant informed her that Adish alias Moses had defiled her and that she pointed the Appellant as the man who went by that name. According to Counsel, the implication of these witnesses’ testimonies is that they support the complainant’s testimony that the Appellant is not a stranger to her but someone that she is very familiar with. Counsel argued that the Appellant refused to cross-examine the complainant on this aspect therefore crystallizing the fact that he was known to the complainant. Counsel submitted that thus this becomes a case of recognition rather than identification of stranger as was stated in the case of Reuben Taabu V Republic where the court opined that recognition is more believable and more reliable than identification of a stranger.






21.
Counsel submitted that the Appellant made two statements in his defence; he introduced himself and stated that the accusations against him were untrue. Counsel argued that he did not put up a defence therefore cannot cry that his defence was not considered while in essence he offered none.






22.
With regard to the legality of the sentence, Counsel submitted that the sentence prescribed by Section 8 (3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 is 20 years imprisonment which the trial Magistrate did not hesitate to pronounce. Counsel cited the case of Bernard Kimani Gacheru v Republic [2002] eKLR in that regard. Counsel observed that there has been conflicting jurisprudence on whether Courts have discretion in sentencing in minimum mandatory sentences prescribed by the Sexual Offence Act. Counsel maintained that in light of the Statutory provisions, the sentence was lenient and not excessive. Counsel cited the Court of Appeal in Onesmus Safari Ngao v Republic [2021] KECA 154 KLR.






23.
In the end, Counsel urged that there was satisfactory and compelling evidence to show that the Appellant committed the offence as charged, that the trial Court sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment and that he has not advanced any lawful reason for the Court to interfere with the sentence.








Determination


24
In determining this appeal, this court being a first appellate court is alive to and takes into account the principles laid down in the case of Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32 where the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa stated that:
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be subjected to a fresh and exhaustive examination (Pandya v R [1975] E.A. 336 and to the appellate Court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions (Shantilal M. Ruwala v R [1957] E.A. 570. It is not the junction of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s findings and conclusions; it must make its own findings and draw its own conclusions. Only then can it decide whether the Magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, see (Peters v Sunday Post [1978] E.A. 424.”






25.
I have carefully considered the evidence on record, the grounds of appeal and submissions for and against the appeal. In my humble view, the main issue for determination is whether the prosecution proved their case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Appellant who defiled the complainant. There are other issues that have been raised by the Appellant in his submissions which I will address my mind to as I determine this main issue.






26.
The Appellant challenged the conviction and sentence on the basis that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, particularly on the question of penetration. Counsel for the Appellant argued that there was no penetration and further maintained that a medical report cannot be used to resuscitate a dead case.






27.
This being a case for defilement what was to be proved are the ingredients of the offence of defilement and in the case of George Opondo Olunga v Republic [2016] eKLR, it was stated that the ingredients of an offence of defilement are; identification or recognition of the offender, penetration and the age of the victim.
Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides as follows:
“8. (1)
A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.
(2)
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life""






28.
In this case the issue of identification has not been challenged in this appeal. The complainant evidence is that of recognition and has not been disputed. Therefore, the two critical elements that must be proved to sustain a conviction for the offence of defilement under these provisions of the law are the act of penetration and the age of the victim.






29.
In this case the issue of identification has not been challenged in this appeal. The complainant evidence is that of recognition and has not been disputed. Therefore, the two critical elements that must be proved to sustain a conviction for the offence of defilement under these provisions of the law are the act of penetration and the age of the victim.






30.
In regard to the age of the complainant herein, the same is not in dispute, as the copy of the certificate of birth on record indicates that the victim was born on 13/11/2007, thus the complainant at the time of commission of the alleged offence was (12) years old.






31.
The next element is proving of penetration. Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines penetration thus:
“penetration” means the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person;






32.
As such even the slightest insertion of the genital organs of one person into the genital organs of another is sufficient to establish a sexual offence.






33.
In her testimony at the trial Court PW3 the complainant testified that as she was going to fetch water when the Appellant pulled her to the store and told her that if she made a sound he will strangle her, he asked her to remove her clothes but she refused and he forcefully removed her trouser and also removed his trouser, she asked him to leave her and he wanted to defile her but they struggled and when her cousin called her, he left her and she ran. She told the Court that she recorded her statement and that the accused inserted his penis into his vagina and removed his underwear but his whole penis did not go inside. She told the Court that they were both standing when the incident occurred.






34.
In Erick Onyango Ondeng’ v Republic [2014] eKLR the Court of Appeal had this to say about penetration:
“
…even partial penetration of the female genital by male genital will suffice to constitute the offence. In Twehangane Alfred v Uganda(supra) the Uganda Court of Appeal expressed the same view as follows:
In sexual offences, the slightest penetration of a female sex organ by a male sex organ is sufficient to constitute the offence. It is not necessary that the hymen be ruptured.”






35.
And in Mark Oiruri Mose v Republic [2013] eKLR, the Court of Appeal had this to say about penetration:






36.
Many times the attacker does not fully complete sexual act during commission of the offence. That is the main reason why the law does not require that evidence of spermatozoa be availed. So long as there is penetration whether only on the surface, the ingredient of the offence is demonstrated, and penetration need not be deep inside the girl's organ.






37.
Further, it is also worth noting that key evidence relied by the Courts in rape cases and defilement in order to prove penetration Is the complainant own testimony which is usually corroborated by the medical report presented by the medical officer. In this case since the complainant was a minor, the evidence of the doctor is key so as to corroborate such testimonies. I have critically analyzed the evidence of PW5 the doctor who testified herein.






38.
It was her testimony that on examination the complainant’s head, neck, stomach, back, lower limbs were normal, her private parts healed, hymnal tears, 3 and 9 o’clock, confluence of vestibule, redness of vulva, had whitish discharge, HIV test was negative, pregnancy test was negative urinalysis was normal and syphilis was negative. She told the Court that the doctor made the observation that the minor had been defiled






39.
From the foregoing there is no doubt that the medical evidence available on record is cogent and consistent, as well as corroborating the testimony of the complainant.






40.
With regard to the charge sheet being defective. The Appellant although not framed as a ground of appeal has submitted that the charge sheet herein is defective as the offence as framed in Count one reads “subsection 8 (1) (3)” being a non-existence provision of the Sexual Offence Act and such the trial Court ought to have acquitted him.






41.
I have myself carefully examined the charge sheet which states the offence and the section of the law under which the Appellant was charged. The only issue with the charge is that it does not clearly state that the offence committed was contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 but instead states as read with Section 8 (1) (3). This omission however does not make the charge sheet defective for the reason that the particulars give the date and the place where the alleged offence took place. The particulars also give the name of the Appellant as well as the name and age of the complainant. It cannot therefore be said that the charge sheet was defective. In any event even if there was such a defect, like the one pointed out earlier, the same is curable by dint of the provisions of Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 of the laws of Kenya. It is also worth noting that the Appellant did not raise this complaint during the trial.






42.
The court recognises that the circumstances surrounding individual offences can vary greatly, and that is so even before one comes to consider the circumstances of the individual offender. While a consistency of approach to sentencing is highly desirable, it is not to be expected that there will be a uniformity in terms of the actual sentences that are imposed. There are just too many variables in terms of circumstances of individual offences, but even more so in the circumstances of individual’s offenders, for that to happen. Again the court recognises that there is no clear blue water between the ranges. Often the most that can be said is that an offence falls in the upper mid-range/lower higher range. In many cases whether an offence is to be labelled as being at the high end of the mid-range or at the low end of the high range for an offence is often a fine call. The judge’s legitimate margin of appreciation may well straddle both. In that event, how is labelled may in fact not impact greatly on the sentence that will ultimately be imposed.






43.
The 
Sexual offences Act
 the letter and the Spirit on Sentencing is to provide effective deterrence for both the convicts and those out there having the itch to go after the young children of Kenya to commit offence prescribed in the Act. That is certainly the objective and design by the legislature for the court to carry out and impose sentences against those found culpable. In the case of R vs Radich 1954 NZ LR 56 deterrence is stated to achieve the following. “ One of the main purpose of punishment is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment. In all civilised countries all ages. That has been the main punishment and it still continues so. “






44.
The Appellant was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. The complainant was 12 years old at the time when the offence was committed. Her certificate of birth shows that she was born on 13/11/2007. In the circumstances, I find that the sentence imposed was merited.






45.
The upshot of the foregoing is that the appeal on both conviction and sentence is hereby dismissed in its entirety.

The Case


The Claimants’ Case


10.
The Claimants filed an application through a Notice of Motion accompanied by a Certificate of urgency and a supporting affidavit based on the following grounds;
i.
That the Respondents conducted a national competition on May 4
th
, 2024, which was not held in a fair manner, was riddled with inconsistencies, and contravened the Laws of Kenya.
ii.
That the qualifiers that were held were full of match fixing, thus rendering the same unfair.
iii.
That given that this activity involves income generation by players, it is equitable and just for the Applicants' rights to be protected by this Honourable Tribunal.






11.
The Application was certified urgent based on the grounds that;
i.
On May 4
th
, 2024, the first Respondent organized and facilitated a national competition. However, the manner in which these competitions were conducted did not adhere to principles of fairness and were in contravention of the applicable legal statutes and regulations of the Republic of Kenya.
ii.
The Applicants hereby pray for the cancellation of the International Esports Federation Kenyan Qualifiers which took place on May 4th, 2024, due to identified procedural and regulatory discrepancies associated with the 1st Respondent and planned execution of these qualifiers.
iii.
These qualifiers, which were organized by the 1st Respondent, were intended for the selection of the national team representing Kenya in the International Esports Federation African Qualifiers which are scheduled for 10
th
 June 2024. The Kenyan qualifiers and the subsequent African Qualifiers include monetary prizes provided by the International Esport Federation.






12.
The 1
st
 Claimant in his Supporting Affidavit stated that;
The Claimants participated in the International Esports Federation National Qualifiers and on May 4th, 2024, the Kenya Professional Esports Federation (1st Respondent) organized the qualifiers.






13.
These qualifiers were marred by irregularities such as match-fixing, preferential treatment, coercion, and discrimination as the 2
nd
 Respondent held multiple roles during the event, including Secretary General, participant, organizer, and referee, violating principles of fair play.






14.
The 2
nd
 Respondent manipulated outcomes, gave walkovers, and favored certain participants, as evidenced by the challenge platform's records. Additionally, short notice and high registration fees discouraged participation, while fee waivers were secretly granted to select players. Security was also used to limit spectator access.






15.
In the PUBG category, on April 24
th
 -25
th
 2024, NS was unfairly declared the winner, prejudicing other teams. The 1
st
 Respondent did not provide guidelines or dispute resolution mechanisms, consolidating decision-making with the 2
nd
 Respondent.






16.
After publicly announcing registration fees, the 1
st
 Respondent privately rescinded them, disenfranchising teams. Complaints of cheating were dismissed by the 2n Respondent, who threatened participants with expulsion.






17.
On May 8
th
, 2024, the 1
st
 Respondent acknowledged the cheating incident publicly. Investigations revealed the 1
st
 Respondent is not registered with the Sports Registrar, lacking legal standing for national events. The 1
st
 Respondent also lacked a professional sports license, violating regulatory requirements.






18.
No public participation was conducted for upcoming qualifiers, leading to concerns about transparency and fairness. The 1
st
 Respondent's lack of a constitution prevented it from legally organizing significant events.






19.
The absence of organizational structure hindered the protection of innocent members in disputes.






20.
The 1
st
 Respondent's failure to disclose key details of the competition exacerbates transparency and accountability issues.






21.
The Honourable Tribunal should take action against the 1
st
 Respondent for operating unlawfully without public participation, contrary to Section 46 of the 
Sports Act
 and that the 1
st
 Respondent’s actions constitute an abuse of Kenyan laws, misleading international bodies into recognizing it as the legitimate governing body for Esports in Kenya.










The Respondent’s Submissions/Response


The Respondents submitted that;


22.
In response to the instant application, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents filed Grounds of Opposition and a Replying Affidavit sworn by the 2
nd
 Respondent a representative of the 1
st
 Respondent on 21
st
 June 2024 in opposition to the Application dated 31
st
 May 2024.






23.
The Issues for determination were;
a.
Whether the Claimants have locus standi to file the present Application.
b.
Whether there were any irregularities during the National Qualifiers that compromised the fairness of the competitions.
c.
Whether the Claimants sufficiently made use of the dispute resolution mechanisms available to them.
d.
Whether the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents violated the orders granted by the Honourable Tribunal in this instant Application






24.
On Whether the Claimants have the locus standi to file the present application, the Respondents averred that the Claimants lacked the legal standing (locus standi) to file the current application challenging the national qualifiers. The Claimants, through Alex Otieno Ouma, alleged participation in these qualifiers. However, the Claimants had not registered for the disputed titles and had previously been assured by the Tribunal in a related case (SDTSC EO12 OF 2024) that they could participate. The Respondent provided evidence showing the Claimants did not participate, thus lacking the right to challenge the qualifiers or claim prejudice.






25.
They placed reliance on the case of Law Society of Kenya...v..Commissioner of Lands & Others, Nakuru High Court Civil Case No. 464 of 2000, where the Court held that: - ""Locus Standi signifies a right to be heard. A person must have sufficiency of interest to sustain his standing to sue in Court of Law"".






26.
Further in the case of Alfred Njau and Others...v..City Council of Nairobi (1982) KAR 229, the Court also held that ""the term Locus Standi means a right to appear in Court and conversely to say that a person has no Locus Standi means that he has no right to appear or be heard in such and such proceedings.""






27.
On whether there were any irregularities during the National qualifiers that compromised the Fairness of the competitions, the Respondents contended that the 1
st
 Respondent's primary goal is to ensure fair competitions, with all participants given equal opportunities. They argued that the rules were communicated to participants and upheld during the qualifiers. The Claimants' accusation of the 2
nd
 Respondent occupying multiple roles was deemed misplaced, as the 2
nd
 Respondent, who also serves as Secretary General, has been trained by the International Esports Federation (IESF) as a referee. The Respondents emphasised that in esports, the roles of a tournament administrator and referee are considered similar, and the Claimants failed to provide evidence to the contrary.






28.
They placed reliance on the IESF Regional Qualifiers 2024 Regulations, Regulation 1.1 which partly states as follows: ""All rules in these Competition Regulations may be changed without prior notice if tournament circumstances require it. All referee decisions are final unless a protest is explicitly allowed. Referees may also adjudicate any cases not specifically covered in this rulebook, and their authority extends to the entire tournament. Any rule changes will take effect immediately upon communication to the participants.""






29.
The claimants have further alleged that the competition was full of match fixing, limitation of participants in the efootball category to 8, charging of a registration fee and collusion with security guards to bar participants from accessing the venue of the tournament. In response to the allegations, the legal burden of proof is clearly stated in Section l07 of the 
Evidence Act
, Chapter 80 Laws of Kenya, which states that; 1) Whoever desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist. 2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.






30.
The Claimant's assertion that the 2
nd
 Respondent engaged in match manipulation using the pseudonym ""MajiMoto"" is baseless. The use of a gamer tag alone does not conclusively link it to the 2
nd
 Respondent, as these tags are common identifiers used by gamers online, and anyone could have used that tag during the tournament. Additionally, none of the participants in the eFootball category raised any concerns about irregularities, making the Claimants' allegations, especially given their non-participation in the event, both unfair and unfounded.






31.
The Claimants' allegation that the number of football participants was limited to 8 is untrue. The Respondents rely on the World Esports Championships 24 Competition Guidelines which provide the criteria for national selections.






32.
There was sufficient notice from the first announcement made on 16
th
 April 2024 to the official dates for the efootball tournament announced on 30
th
 April 2024. The tournament had 8 participants. This met the minimum requirements of the national selection process as efootball is a single game title whose threshold for participation was 8 players.






33.
The Claimants' allegations that the tournament was held in secrecy are incorrect. The announcement on April 30, 2024, clearly included the venue, registration fees, and event details, with a registration link stating a 10:30 AM kickoff time. Additionally, the eFootball tournament ran from morning to afternoon, and the Tekken event took place from 6 PM to 6 AM, all of which were clearly outlined in the announcement poster. Therefore, the Claimants' assertion of undisclosed event details is untrue.






34.
The Claimants' assertion of collusion between the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents and the security personnel is unfounded. The security team was fulfilling its duty to protect the premises, allowing two hours for tournament participants to enter before restricting movement from 9 PM to 6 AM for safety reasons. This was done in line with their contractual obligations and does not indicate collusion. The Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims of collusion at Pinetree Plaza.






35.
On whether the Claimants sufficiently made use of the dispute resolution mechanisms available to them, the Claimants' allegation that the 1
st
 Respondent lacks an internal dispute resolution mechanism is inaccurate. The 1
st
 Respondent offers multiple avenues for raising disputes, including contacting officials during competitions or using provided channels such as email or social media. Complaints are investigated, and actions may include cancelling the tournament or awarding a new winner. Additionally, the International Esports Federation Competition Regulations give referees the final decision-making authority in tournaments.






36.
That the nature of the issue raised by the PUBG participants regarding the winners Star 4orce did not result from a violation of the competition rules and instead it is regarding the nationality of one of the teammates of Star 4orce. In line with regulation 1.1 of the IESF Regional Qualifiers 2024 Competition Guidelines, ""A referee may adjudicate any cases not specifically covered in this rulebook and their authority extends to the entire tournament."" Further Regulation 1.2 partly states that: -""the competitive roster of each participating party must consist solely of citizens of the nation they represent.""






37.
The winning PUBG team included non-Kenyan nationals, and upon inquiry, the team couldn't provide valid identification. The captain admitted one teammate was not Kenyan and used someone else’s ID. As the team failed to provide a substitute within the given timeframe, they were disqualified. The second-place team was then declared the winners of the PUBG competition.






38.
It is worth noting that while the Claimants alleged irregularities in the efootball tournament, they have failed to raise the issue with the 1st Respondent which would have allowed for avenues to mitigate their concerns. Further, they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that they attempted to raise their concerns and the same was not dealt with.






39.
On Whether the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents violated the orders granted by the Honourable Tribunal in this instant Application, the Respondents only became aware of the orders during their Tribunal appearance due to the Claimants' failure to serve them properly. The names of selected players were submitted before the application: for PUBG on May 15, 2024, at 7:41 PM, and for efootball on May 21, 2024, at 12:04 PM. These players secured spots in the offline Africa Regional Qualifiers and the World Esports Championships, scheduled for Casablanca, Morocco, in August 2024, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in November 2024.






40.
The World Esports Championships 2024 had specific deadlines that needed to be met for gamer participation. The names of the selected players have been sent to the Moroccan Embassy for visa processing by the International Esports Federation. On the same day the Respondents became aware of the orders, fixtures for the online Africa Regional Qualifiers 2024 were scheduled. The Claimants' allegations about players participating in the tournament are unfounded.






41.
We assert that the Claimants' orders have expired, and once the Respondents were informed of them, they complied fully. Participants scheduled to compete after the Respondents' awareness of the orders have been disqualified. Only the winners of the PUBG and efootball categories, who qualified directly, are set to participate in the Offline Africa Regional Qualifiers and the World Esports Championships. Additionally, the Claimants have not provided adequate evidence to show that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents violated the Tribunal's orders.






42.
The instant application against the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent should be dismissed for the following reasons:
i.
The Claimants in this application did not participate in the national qualifiers and have failed to prove their participation in the national qualifiers which is the subject matter of this instant application.
ii.
The Claimants have failed to provide sufficient evidence that the tournament was filled with irregularities and should therefore be nullified.
iii.
The Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence to warrant nullifying the national qualifiers that would otherwise amount to Kenya being disqualified from participating in the offline Africa Regional Qualifiers according to Regulation 1.4 of the Regional Qualifiers Competition Regulations. Thus, disenfranchising those that actively participated and qualified for the regional qualifiers.










Hearing


43.
The matter proceeded by way of written submissions.








Discussion


44.
Having taken into account the parties’ pleadings and written submissions, the Tribunal states as follows:






45.
The jurisdiction of this Tribunal stems from Section 58 of the 
Sports Act
 which provides as follows:
“
The Tribunal shall determine—
a.
appeals against decisions made by national sports organizations or umbrella national sports organizations, whose rules specifically allow for appeals to be made to the Tribunal in relation to that issue including —
i.
appeals against disciplinary decisions;
ii.
appeals against not being selected for a Kenyan team or squad;
b.
other sports-related disputes that all parties to the dispute agree to refer to the Tribunal and that the Tribunal agrees to hear; and
(c)
appeals from decisions of the Registrar under this Act.”






46.
Section 59 of the 
Sports Act
 states further that:
“
The Tribunal may, in determining disputes apply alternative dispute resolution methods for sports disputes and provide expertise and assistance regarding alternative dispute resolution to the parties to a dispute.”






47.
This is a claim touching on issues of procedural compliance, deadlines for participation, and whether the Respondents adhered to the Tribunal's orders regarding player participation in esports tournaments. This is therefore a dispute falling under section 58 (c) of the 
Sports Act
. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to handle this matter.






48.
We also take the view that the Claimant is properly before us and has locus standi to file this case. Section 58(c) of the 
Sports Act
 provides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine appeals from the decisions of the Sports Registrar under the Act. As much as the proposed sports organization, the Kenya Professional Esports Federation is not registered this suit has been brought by the Claimants who have capacity to sue or file this appeal against the Respondents.






49.
The interpretation by the Respondents and the assertion that the Claimants have no locus standi is to say the least too narrow and bereft of critical underpinnings of the law. Certainly, this was never the intention of Parliament when they promulgated the 
Sports Act
, 2013.Indeed, Article 48 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya provides that:
“
The State shall ensure access to justice for all persons...”






50.
Having stated as much we are of the view that this dispute can best be addressed under Section 59 of the 
Sports Act
. The Claimants and the Respondents have attempted to resolve this matter amicably but without any measure of success as seen from their pleadings. However, this dispute still provides a watershed moment for the parties to resolve it through mediation with the expertise and assistance of this Tribunal.








Conclusion


51.
It is therefore in consideration of this, as well as the parties’ submissions that the Tribunal makes the following orders:
a.
The parties will proceed to mediation immediately. The file will be placed before Hon Bernard Murunga who is already handling a mediation process in STDSC/E012/2024 involving Kenya Professional E-Sport Federation. Mr. Murunga will advise the parties after review of the file on the modalities of the process within 7 days of this decision. The Tribunal may extend such timelines where it considers it necessary;
b.
Should the parties herein fail to agree the Tribunal shall proceed to determine the matter on merit;
c.
The matter shall be mentioned on 24
th
 September 2024 virtually via a platform that will be shared with the parties ahead of time to confirm compliance and for further directions;
d.
Each party shall bear its own costs.

          ((Being   an   Appeal   from     the   Judgment     delivered   by   the Honourable S. MWANGI Senior Resident Magistrate on the 16th August 2023 in Murang’a Civil Suit No 399 of 2016))
        
      






Judgment










1.
By a Plaint dated 2
nd
 November 2016, the Plaintiff ( Respondent herein), sought for  Judgement  against the Defendants ( Appellant herein) for the following orders:
i.
A declaration that the Plaintiff is the legal owner of Land Parcel No. Kakuzi/Kimiri/Block 8/349.
ii.
The Defendant be ordered to forthwith render vacant possession of the portion of land that he does occupy to the Plaintiff, otherwise he be forcefully evicted at his own cost.
iii.
The costs and interest of the suit.
iv.
Any other or better relief the Honourable court may deem fit to grant.






2.
The Plaintiff’s(Respondent’s) claim was premised on dispute of the ownership and occupation of the land parcel No. Kakuzi/Kirimiri/Block 8/349. The Plaintiff (Respondent) had alleged that the Defendant/Appellant illegally encroached unto the suit property, and constructed on the said land parcel, which parcel of land belonged to the Plaintiff(Respondent).






3.
The Plaintiff(Respondent) had relied on his Witness Statement dated 2/11/2016, his list of documents, further list of witnesses and documents dated 23
rd
 January 2020, and 21
st
 April 2022 respectively, and urged the trial court to allow his claim.






4.
The initial Defendant (Joseph Njenga Kaguma), passed away on 23
rd
 May 2020, before the conclusion of the case and vide a Notice of Motion Application dated 23
rd
 February 2021, leave was sought to substitute the said Defendant Joseph Njenga Kaguma- deceased, with his legal representative Jane Wangari Njenga. Subsequently, an amended Defendant’s Statement of Defence was filed on 24
th
 May 2021.






5.
The Defendant (Appellant) vehemently denied the Plaintiff’s/ Respondent’s claim, and averred that he was in quiet possession and occupation of her(their) parcel of land No. Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/351, and that the Plaintiff’s claim were wild allegations. She also denied ever having encroached on the property owned by the Plaintiff(Respondent), and that the claim for vacant possession is made in bad faith.






6.
Further, the Defendant(Appellant), alleged that the Plaintiff claim was stale, and the court had no reasons to hear stale claims, made by a party who came to court with dirty hands.






7.
Further, the Defendant had alleged that the Plaintiff’s claim was bad in law, incompetent, frivolous, vexatious and without a reasonable cause of action, as the claim lacked legal basis. He had urged the trial court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s suit with costs.






8.
After the Pre-trial, the matter proceed for viva voce evidence. In his evidence, the Plaintiff claimed that he was the owner of the suit land, and that the Defendant had illegally and wrongfully occupied the suit land, which occupation denied the Plaintiff the use of the suit land. On the other hand, the Defendant alleged that the suit land was his, and that the Plaintiff had no ownership of the land in question.






9.
The Plaintiff called one witness, namely Charles Mwangi Ndungu, (Pw2), who was identified as the secretary of Mutithi Farmers’ Cooperative Society. He adopted his witness statement as his evidence in chief, and reiterated the Plaintiff’s evidence.






10.
In cross examination, PW2 gave the history of the land, and detailed how one became a member of the said Society, and that upon payment of the required money, one would be issued with a Share Certificate, which entitled one to ballot for land. He further averred that the Society members were to be apportioned 2 acres of land each on condition that they called a Surveyor to subdivided the entire land. Upon subdivision, each member was shown his/ her parcel of land on the grounds by the Surveyor.






11.
The Appellant herein, Jane Wangari (DW2) testified that the original Defendant, her late husband (Joseph Njenga Kaguma), was the owner of land parcel No.  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351, wherein as a family they have been in possession and occupation since 1977.






12.
The Appellant(Defendant) adopted her Witness Statement as her evidence in chief. On cross examination, she stated that she occupied the suit land in 1977, as a squatter as the title deeds were yet to be issued. Further, that when the Surveyor subdivided the land, he asked those who had occupied other lands to move, and subsequently, they were issued with title deed in 1989, after balloting.






13.
After hearing the parties and their witnesses, the trial court ordered for a site visit, to the disputed parcels of land, in the presence of the County Surveyor, who ascertained the status of the land parcels Kakuzi/Kirimiri/Block 8/349 and 351 on ground and on the map. The Surveyor later produced a Survey Report dated 24
th
 April 2024, which the trial court relied on to make its determination.






14.
Upon hearing both parties, the trial court delivered its Judgement on 16
th
 August 2023, in favour of the Plaintiff (Respondent) as follows:
a.
A declaration be and is hereby made that the Plaintiff is the legal owner of land parcel number Kakuzi/Kirimiri/Block 8/349.
b.
The Defendant, and or his legal representative, be and is hereby ordered to forthwith render vacant possession of the portion he does not occupy to the Plaintiff, otherwise he and/or his legal representatives be forcibly evicted at his and/or their own cost.
c.
A permanent injunction be and is hereby issued against the defendant and/or his legal representatives and their servants or agents from entering, remaining, trespassing, dealing or otherwise interfering with the plaintiff’s possession and use his suit land No. Kakuzi/Kirimiri/Block 8/349.
d.
The plaintiff is also awarded costs of this suit and interest therein until payment in full.






15.
Dissatisfied with the trial court’s decision, the Appellant, filed the instant Appeal vide a Memorandum of Appeal dated 14
th
 September 2023, on the following grounds:
1.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact by making a finding that the Appellant had encroached on the Respondents land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/349 despite there being evidence to the contrary.
2.
The Learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by making a finding that the Appellant and his family encroached the entire land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/349 and a portion of land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/350 and further that the registered owner of land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/350 is the one who had encroached on land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/351 and the other part of KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/350.
3.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact by making a finding that the Appellant and her family be evicted from the Respondents land which they had allegedly encroached upon in light of the protection afforded by Sections 24,25and 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
.
4.
The Learned Magistrate erred in both law and facts by issuing a permanent injunction against the Appellant despite the fact that the Respondent had not met the threshold for granting of a permanent injunction.
5.
The Learned Magistrate erred in both facts and law by failing to appreciate the evidence tendered by the Appellant and Land Surveyor and analyse and the correct law thereby arriving at an erroneous conclusion that is not premised on evidence and law in respect of the orders sought by the Respondent.
6.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider all the issues presented before her to enable her make an informed decision.
7.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in putting more weight on the Respondent's submissions than the Appellants' to the detriment of the appellant and which is clearly demonstrated in the lopsided Judgment.
8.
The Learned Magistrate erred in both law and facts by granting the prayers/remedies sought by the Respondent thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice.
9.
The Learned Magistrate erred in both law and facts by issuing orders that were ambiguous, nebulous, imprecise and/or incapable of compliance.
10.
The Learned Magistrate misapprehended the law and facts by considering extraneous matters which were not in issue.
11.
The Learned Magistrate erred in both law and fact by ruling the way she did.






16.
The Appellant sought for orders that :
a.
This appeal be allowed.
b.
The lower Court Judgment delivered on 16th August 2023, and orders thereeof be vacated and/or set aside and the orders sought by the Aappellant in lower court for dismissal of the Respondents suit with costs be granted.
c.
The costs of this appeal and of the proceedings in the lower court awarded to the appellant.






17.
The Record of Appeal was filed on 29
th
 November 2023, and this Court admitted the Appeal, and directed that the same be canvassed by way of written submissions. The Appellant filed his written submissions on 11
th
 March, 2024, through the Law Firm of MBUE NDEGWA & CO ADVOCATES, and set out the following facts;
a)
That the Appellant is the registered owner of land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/351, measuring approximately 0.8040 Hectares or thereabouts.
b)
That the Appellant has been in actual, physical occupation and possession of the said land since 1977.
c)
That the Appellant has extensively developed the said land over the years.
d)
The Appellant was allocated the said parcel of land by MUTITHI FARMERS CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY, which he had occupied since the year 1977.
e)
That upon his demise, his mortal remains were interred on the said parcel of land.
f)
The Respondent is the registered owner of land parcel number KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/349.






Appellant’s Case:


18.
In his submissions, the Appellant submitted that from the Surveyor’s Report dated 24th April 2023, it was evident that the Appellant has never encroached on the Respondent’s parcel of Land, as alleged in his Plaint. Further, the Appellant submitted that it was clear that the Respondent’s land was affected by the road running along land parcels numbers, 342,349,350,367 and many others along that strip. That the Respondent’s recourse if any lies elsewhere, but not against the Appellant.






19.
The Appellant disputed the findings of the Surveyor as contained in his Report on pages 8-9, and submitted that the said finding failed to take into account the fact that the Appellant was in occupation and use of the said parcel of land, since the year 1977. Further, the appellant pointed out that the subdivision of the properties came much later, including the road that affected Respondent’s parcel of land that is land parcel No. KAKUZI/KIRIMIRI/BLOCK 8/349. Therefore, the Appe1lant cannot be said to have wrongly entered and developed land parcel No.349.






20.
It was his further submissions that the Surveyor’s Report on one hand at pg. 6 stated that the Respondent’s land was affected by the road, and then at pages 8-9 stated that the Appellant wrongfully entered and developed the Respondent’s land, and therefore the two positions are diametrically opposed.






21.
The Appellant was in agreement with the proposition of the Surveyor on page 9 of the Report which stated;
“
In the interest of settling this matter, one Harrison Kunyona Mungai, who has been rendered landless in the mixed up occupations agrees to take up land parcel Kakuzi Kirimiri B1.8/352 which in the title register belonged to one Benard Kariuki Nduati (who is settled in parcel Kakuzi Kirimiri B1.8/351). Either the option of Transfer of Title deeds or the Map amendment by re-numbering the parcels of land to match ground occupations shall be considered where best possible following set practice regulations.”






22.
Further, the Appellant invited the court to have a look at Section 15-17 of the 
Land Registration Act
, 2012, and submitted that in the said sections, the Director of Survey is empowered to alter and rectify boundary lines or position of a boundary, based on a cadastral as per the subdivision plan, combination plan or any other approved plan necessitating the alteration of the boundary.






23.
It was submitted that from the Surveyor’s Report referred to above, the other Surveyor’s Report dated October 2016, and 5th September 2016 (pgs. 41 and 42) of the Record, it is  abundantly clear that the issue at hand is one of a boundary dispute, and establishment of beacons for the two (2) parcels of land and not an encroachment/trespass issue.






24.
To buttress the submission above, the Appellant relied entirely on the decision in the case of Reuben Kioko Mutyaene v Hellen Kiunga Miriti & 4 others; Ntalala Eric Mutura &amp; another (Interested Parties)[2021] eKLR;






25.
In the Court of Appeal Case of Azzuri Limited v Pink Properties Limited [2018] eKLR, the court stated as follows in relation to the application of Section 18 of the 
Land Registration Act
;
“
This means that under the aforesaid provisions, boundary disputes pertaining to lands falling within general boundary areas must be referred to the Land Registrar for resolution…….From this analysis of the law, it should be clear from the above that, we are in agreement with the learned Judge’s conclusion that the dispute ought to have been heard by the Land Registrar as stated in the statute. Jurisdiction is everything. It has been said many times before, that, without it a court has no powers to make one more step, irrespective of the strength and nature of evidence in the parties’ possession”






26.
Reliance was also placed in  the case of George Kamau Macharia & Dexka Limited (2019)eKLR,  where the court  stated as follows:
“
From the above provisions of the law, it is manifestly clear that the above section gives the mandate to the Land Registrar to resolve boundary disputes of land with general boundaries. Registry index map (RIM) only indicates approximate boundaries and the approximate situation on the ground. Even if this court was to hear and determine this matter it will still require the input of the Land Registrar. The framers of section 18 (2)of the 
Land Registration Act
 placed this matter before the land registrar who has the technical advice and resources of the district surveyor to determine and ascertain the boundaries. It is trite law that where the law has given a legal obligation to a department of government, it is important for the court to let that department proceed to meet its legal obligations. In this case the office of the land registrar is mandated to deal with the general boundary dispute first before the same is escalated to the court. It is the view of this court that the dispute is prematurely before the court”.






27.
The Appellant further cited the decisions of the Court in case of Willis Ocholla v Mary Ndege (2016) Eklr, and Court of Appeal Case of Estate Sonrisa Ltd &amp; another v Samuel Kamau Macharia & 2 others [2020] eKLR , that reiterated what was held in the case cited above, that disputes relating to boundaries ought to be resolved by the Land Registrar in the first instance. Further, that such decision can thereof be challenged in court, pursuant to provisions of Sections 79 (3A), 80,86 and 91(9) 0f the 
Land Registration Act
.






28.
Ultimately, the Appellant submitted that the trial court ought not to have made a determination of the matter the way it did, but instead ought to have referred the matter back to the Land Registrar for determination of the boundary dispute as per the provisions of Sections 18 and 19 of the 
Land Registration Act
, 2012. It was also submitted that the Land Registrar, has the requisite technical skills and expertise to determine the same.






29.
The Appellant invited this court to look at the Respondent’s Plaint appearing on pg.3 of the Record of Appeal where the Respondent at prayer (d), urged the court to make: “Any other or better relief the Honourable Court may deem fit to grant.”






30.
The Appellant cited the case law in Reuben Kioko Mutyaene v Hellen Kiunga Miriti & 4 others; Ntalala Eric Mutura & another (Interested Parties) [2021] eKLR; where it was held that;
“
It is trite law that where the 1aw has given a legal obligation to a department of Government, it is important for the Court to let that department proceed to meet the legal obligations. In this case the office of the Land Registrar is mandated to deal with the general boundary dispute first before the same is escalated to the Court. It is the view of this Court that the dispute is prematurely before the Court.”






31.
Reliance was also placed in the case of Speaker of National Assembly -Versus- Karume (1992) KLR 21, where the court held:-
“
Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures.”






32.
Further, the Appellant invited this court to look at the record and find that both the Appellant and the Respondent produced their respective title deeds, and that the Respondent did not challenge the Appellant’s title. That in light of Sections 25 and 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
,2012, he remains the rightful, absolute and indefeasible owner of his parcel of land, with all the rights and privileges accruing therefrom; including the right to possession, to a quiet and peaceful occupation and right to use of his property.






33.
In conclusion, the Appellant submitted that he had demonstrated that the Respondent did not prove that he was deserving of the orders that were eventually granted by the trial court, vide the Decree issued on 26
th
 October 2023.








Respondent’s Case:


34.
The Respondent filed his written submissions dated 26
th
 April 2024, through the Law Firm of R.M NJIRAINI & CO ADVOCATES, and submitted that this being a first Appeal, then the duty of this court as the first appeal are well settled and he cited the case of Nashon Onyango Otieno v George Onyango Otieno [2021] eKLR, where the court stated;
“
This being a 1
st
 appeal, it is the duty of this court to review the evidence adduced before the lower court, and satisfy itself that the decision was well-founded. The jurisdiction of 1
st
 appellate Court was well settled in the case of Selle & Another vs. Associated Motor B Co.Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123, which was quoted in the case of Barnabas Biwott v Thor Kipkorir Bundotich [2018] eKLR as thus:
“...this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court …is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect...”






35.
The Respondent further submitted that the jurisdiction of this court is set out under sections 162(2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, Section, Section 13 of the 
Environment and Land Court Act
 and Section 9 of the Magistrates Courts Act.  it was also submitted that an Appeal on jurisdiction is thereof misconceived.






36.
Further, the Respondent submitted that the trial court heard the parties and their witnesses, visited the site, called for an expert opinion in form of a Surveyor, and the evidence was very clear that the Appellant had illegally occupied the Respondent’s parcel of land. That the Surveyor Report was emphatic, and therefore, the trial Court pronounced itself properly on facts, evidence and the law.






37.
In conclusion, the Respondent submitted that the Appeal herein is misconceived, since the trial court pronounced itself in accordance with the law and evidence. Further, the Respondent submitted that Section 13. (7) of the Environment and Land court gives the Court powers to make orders namely;
(7)
In exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act, the Court shall have power to make any order and grant any relief as the Court deems fit and just, including-
(a)
interim or permanent preservation orders including injunctions;
(b)
prerogative orders;
(c)
award of damages;
(d)
compensation; The 
Environment and Land Court Act
, 2011 10
(e)
specific performance;
(f)
restitution;
(g)
declaration; or
(h)
costs.






38.
It was also submitted that since   this is a first Appeal, then it is the  duty of the Court  to analyse and re-assess the evidence on record, and reach its own independent decision in the matter as provided by Section 78 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
.  Reliance was placed in the case of Selle …Vs… Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123, where the Court held that;
“
An appeal to this Court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial, and the principles upon which this Court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this Court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions, though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular this Court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence or if the impression based on the demeanor of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally (Abdul Hameed Saif vs. Ali Mohamed Sholan(1955), 22 E. A. C. A. 270).
1.
The above is the summary of the facts and evidence before the trial court, as contained in the Record of Appeal, the Memo of Appeal and the rival written submissions. As this Court determines the instant Appeal, it will take into account that it can  only interfere with the discretion of the trial Court, where it is shown that the said discretion was exercised contrary to the law, or that the trial Magistrate misapprehended the applicable law, and failed to take into account a relevant factor or took into account an irrelevant factor, or that on the facts and law as known, the decision is plainly wrong.  See the case of  Mbogo & Another V Shar(1968) EA 93;
“
An appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of the trial court’s discretion unless it is satisfied that the court in exercising its discretion misdirected itself in some matters and as a result arrived at a decision that was erroneous, or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the court has been clearly wrong in the exercise of judicial discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice.” “The discretion is intended so to be exercised to avoid injustice or hardship resulting from accident, inadvertence, or excusable mistake or error, but is not designed to assist the person who has deliberately sought whether by evasion or otherwise, to obstruct or delay the course of justice.”






39.
Having carefully read and considered the Record of Appeal, the Grounds of Appeal, the respective  written submissions by the parties herein, this court finds the issues for determination are;
1.
Whether the trial Court had Jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute.
2.
Whether the Appeal is merited
3.
Who should bear costs of this Appeal?






I). Whether the trial Court had Jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute.


40.
It is trite that Jurisdiction is everything, and without it, the court has no option but to down its tools. The Appellant herein has averred and submitted that the trial court erred in law and fact when it proceeded to determine the dispute before it, which was purely a boundary dispute and ought to have been referred to the Land Registrar as provided by sections  18 and 19  of the  
Land Registration Act
, 2012,  and thus the trial court had no Jurisdiction.






41.
On his part, the Respondent submitted that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the dispute before it, as the dispute is over encroachment of the Respondent’s land and thus it was one falling under section 13 of ELC Act, which sets out the jurisdiction of the ELC. He proceeded to submit that trial court made a sound determination based on the available evidence and applicable law.






42.
For this court to determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the matter before, this court will consider the claim as filed, the evidence tendered, and the exhibits produced by the parties.






43.
What is not in dispute is that the Respondent(Plaintiff)  Harrison Kunyonya Mungai,  is the registered owner of land parcel No.  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349.  Further, there is no doubt that the late Joseph Njenga Kaguma,  is the registered owner of land parcel No.  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351.






44.
Though the Respondent(Plaintiff) had sought for a declaration that he was the legal owner of the land parcel no Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349, there was no evidence that anyone else leave alone the Appellant had claimed ownership of this title. The Respondent had produced his certificate of title, and the Appellant did not dispute it. The appellant too had his own certificate of title.






45.
Further, the Late Joseph Njenga Kaguma, had his title deed for land parcel no  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351,  registered in his name of  5
th
 May 1989,  and no one is disputing this registration in his name. therefore, as the registered owners, the Appellant and the Respondent, were deemed to be the absolute and indefeasible owners of their respective parcels of land.






46.
As the absolute and indefeasible owners, the Appellant and Respondent are entitled to enjoy all the rights and privileges appurtenant thereto. Right to possession, occupation and use of their parcels of land is one of such right.






47.
The above rights can only be enjoyed if one is in actual possession and occupation of their respective parcel of land. A proprietor of land can take possession and be in occupation of the land, if he is shown the physical land, enters unto it and start to use it. This is done after the land is identified by the Surveyor and Land Registrar, and then delivered to the registered owner.






48.
The dispute herein is that though both the Appellant and Respondent have their respective certificates of title, the Respondent is landless as he has no land to occupy , possess and make use of it. On the other hand, it was alleged that the Appellant entered unto the Respondent’s parcel of land being Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349,  and thus should give the Respondent vacant possession.






49.
It was the Appellant’s claim that she has been in occupation of the suit land since 1977, and certainly, her family and herself could not have entered into the wrong parcel of land, that is Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349, instead of block 8/ 351.






50.
From the Surveyor’s report that was produced in court as exhibit, the issue in dispute is a boundary dispute . The law is very clear that boundary disputes ought to be referred to the Land Registrar. See section 18 of the  
Land Registration Act
.






51.
In the case of  Azzuri limited vs Pink Properties limited (2018) eKLR,  the court of Appeal stated as follows:
“
... boundary disputes pertaining to lands falling within general boundary areas must be referred to the Land Registrar for resolution; while disputes pertaining to lands with fixed boundaries may be investigated and possibly resolved simply through a surveyor…From this analysis of the law, it should be clear from the above that, we are in agreement with the learned Judge’s conclusion that the dispute ought to have been heard by the Land Registrar as stated in the statute. Jurisdiction is everything. It has been said many times before, that, without it a court has no powers to make one more step, irrespective of the strength and nature of evidence in the parties’ possession.”






52.
Further, in the case of  Willis Ochola vs Mary Ndege( 2016) eKLR,  the court held:
“
That in terms of Section 18 (2) of the 
Land Registration Act
, proprietors of registered land with a boundary dispute are obligated to first seek redress or solution from the Land Registrar before moving or escalating the dispute to this court. That where such a party fails to do so, and comes to court without first seeking redress from the Land Registrar, the court being a court of law, has to remind such a party that he/she has moved the court prematurely. That the provisions of Section 18 (2) of the 
Land Registration Act
 shows clearly that the court is without jurisdiction on boundary disputes of registered land until after the land Registrar's determination on the same has been rendered.”






53.
From the above case law and provisions of law, it is clear that any dispute relating to boundaries ought to be resolved by the Land Registrar in the first place, before coming to court. This was the holding of the court in the case of  George Kamau Macharia v Dexka Limited [2019] eKLR:
“
Registry Index Map (RIM) only indicates approximate boundaries and the approximate situation on the ground. Even if this Court was to hear and determine this matter it will still require the input of the Land Registrar. The framers of section 18(2) of the 
Land Registration Act
 placed this matter before the Land Registrar who has the technical advice and resources of the District Surveyor to determine and ascertain the boundaries. It is trite law that where the law has given a legal obligation to a department of Government, it is important for the Court to let that department proceed to meet its legal obligations. In this case the office of the Land Registrar is mandated to deal with the general boundary dispute first before the same is escalated to the Court. It is the view of this Court that the dispute is prematurely before the Court.”






54.
Where the Law has set out the clear procedure for redress, or mechanisms for dispute resolution, then the parties are obligated to follow the laid down procedures before appearing in court. See the case of Kimani Wanyoike versus Electoral Commission Civil Appeal No. 213 of 1995 (UR), where the Court held that:-
‘Where there is a law prescribed by either 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament governing a procedure for the redress of any particular grievance that procedure should be strictly followed’.






55.
In the case of  
Speaker of the National Assembly v Karume (Civil Application 92 of 1992
) [1992] KECA 42 (KLR) (29 May 1992) (Ruling), the Court held:
“
In our view, there is considerable merit in the submission that where there is a clear procedure for the redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. We observe without expressing a concluded view that order 53 of the Civil Procedure Rules cannot oust clear constitutional and statutory provisions.”






56.
What is clear is that the dispute before the trial court was not a challenge over the Certificate of titles held by either the Appellant or the Respondent, but a boundaries dispute, or physical identification of each parcel of land. Therefore, the dispute before the trial court was a boundary dispute, which falls under section 18 and 19 of the  
Land Registration Act
.  therefore the trial court ought to have referred the matter to the Land Registrar for hearing of the boundary dispute. This court finds and holds that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine a boundary dispute before referring it to the Land Registrar.








ii)Whether the Appeal is merited?


57.
In its findings, the trial court issued four substantive order. The first order was a declaration that the Plaintiff( Respondent) was the legal owner of land parcel No. Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349. As the court held earlier, the Respondent as the Plaintiff before the trial court was a holder of certificate if title for the above parcel of land. There was no dispute over the said certificate of title. The said certificate of title was not challenged under any of the exceptions provided in section 26(1) a& b of the 
Land Registration Act
. The Respondent being the registered owner of the land parcel no. Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349, then the trial court had no option but to declare him as the legal owner of this parcel of land .The Appellant was not claiming this title at all.






58.
The second order issued by the trial court was for the Defendant(Appellant) to give vacant possession of the portion of land he does not occupy to the plaintiff, otherwise he be forcibly evicted. This order is a bit confusing, in that it refers to the land that the Defendant does not occupy, and if he does not occupy it, how can she give vacant possession to what she does not occupy?






59.
However, this court can take it that there was a typographical error, which error was not corrected. The court has considered the Plaint filed before at the trial court, and has noted that prayer no b was to the effect ‘ the defendant be ordered to forth with render vacant possession of the portion he does occupy to the plaintiff, otherwise he be forcibly evicted at his own costs”






60.
Given that prayer No b, on the statement of claim was for vacant possession of the portion of land that he does occupy, then this court will presume that the trial court meant the portion of land that he does occupy, but not the portion of land that he does not occupy.






61.
Be that as it may, the Appellant,(as Defendant) had denied that she was in occupation of the Plaintiff’s(Respondent) portion of land. This court has found and held that the dispute is a boundary dispute, which ought to have been referred to the Land Registrar, but which was not, and thus the trial court had no jurisdiction. Without jurisdiction, then the trial court ought to have referred the dispute to the right forum. See the case of 
Speaker of the National Assembly v Karume (Civil Application 92 of 1992
) [1992] KECA 42 (KLR) (29 May 1992) (Ruling).






62.
The Appellant denied to have been in occupation of the Respondent’s parcel of land. This court does appreciate that the trial court did visit the locus quo, in the presence of the County Surveyor. The trial court made some observations, and thereafter the surveyor prepared a Report, which was produced in court as an exhibit.






63.
This court also note that in the site visit, the Land Registrar was not present, but the Muranga County Surveyor, Mr Ndivu was present, and the trial court noted that the Surveyor showed the trial court the boundaries as per the R.I.M. Further the trial court observed that there was encroachment from land parcel no. 354, down to 349 upto 354.






64.
It was further observed that the Surveyor was to meet with all the proprietors of the affected parcels of land, and then prepare a Report. From the court record, the Surveyors Report dated 16
th
 May 2023, contains conclusions and recommendation. Of particular concern to this court is that:-  the owner of land parcel no Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351, one Joseph Njenga Kaguma( deceased), who was represented by Jane Wangari Njenga , should surrender this title deed number Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351, and be registered as the owner of land parcel no Kakuzi/ Kirimiri Block 8/ 349.






65.
From the above findings, it is very clear that there is a dispute over the identification of the registered parcels of land on the ground. This problem cannot be resolved by evicting one party. The concerned government officers should visit the disputed parcels of land, involve all the parties and pick out the boundaries, and the parcels of land as per the Registered Index Map, Survey plan and the title deeds.






66.
The 
Land Registration Act
 is very clear on which office should carry out the above stated exercise, AS this office is that of the Land Registrar, assisted by the County Surveyor. Sections 18 and 19 of the 
Land Registration Act
 provide as follows:
“
Section 18 of the 
Land Registration Act
 states as follows:
(1)
Except where, in accordance with section 20, it is noted in the register that the boundaries of a parcel have been fixed, the cadastral map and any filed plan shall be deemed to indicate the approximate boundaries and the approximate situation only of the parcel.
(2)
The court shall not entertain any action or other proceedings relating to a dispute as to the boundaries of registered land unless the boundaries have been determined in accordance with this section.
(3)
Except where, it is noted in the register that the boundaries of a parcel have been fixed, the Registrar may, in any proceedings concerning the parcel, receive such evidence as to its boundaries and situation as may be necessary:
Provided that where all the boundaries are defined under section 19 (3), the determination of the position of any uncertain boundary shall be done as stipulated in the 
Survey Act
 (Cap. 299).
Section 19 of the 
Land Registration Act
 stipulates as follows:
(1)
If the Registrar considers it desirable to indicate on a filed plan approved by the office or authority responsible for the survey of land, or otherwise to define in the register, the precise position of the boundaries of a parcel or any parts thereof, or if an interested person has made an application to the Registrar, the Registrar shall give notice to the owners and occupiers of the land adjoining the boundaries in question of the intention to ascertain and fix the boundaries.
(2)
The Registrar shall, after giving all persons appearing in the register an opportunity of being heard, cause to be defined by survey, the precise position of the boundaries in question, file a plan containing the necessary particulars and make a note in the register that the boundaries have been fixed, and the plan shall be deemed to accurately define the boundaries of the parcel.
(3)
Where the dimensions and boundaries of a parcel are defined by reference to a plan verified by the office or authority responsible for the survey of land, a note shall be made in the register, and the parcel shall be deemed to have had its boundaries fixed under this section.”






67.
The parties herein ought to have given the Land Registrar a chance to address the boundary dispute herein. This court will be guided by the holding of the Court of Appeal in the case of  the Estate of Sonrise ltd & another vs Samuel Kamau Macharia& 2 others ( 2020) eKLR,  where the court held:
“
It is the 
Land Registration Act
 that makes provisions relating to the determination of boundaries. Those provisions are found in sections 16 to 19. Specifically, for this dispute, the Registrar is empowered, after giving notice to all the affected parties, in this case, the 1st appellant and 1st respondent, indeed as well as any owner whose land adjoins the boundaries in question, and with the assistance of the surveyor, to ascertain and fix the disputed boundaries… Under that Act, the Registrar carries out his functions without any restrictions and may rely on any other relevant document and existing records in order to resolve any dispute between landowners. Because a title deed is only prima facie evidence of the matters shown  therein, the Registrar’s investigations, of necessity must encompass all entries in the register, rely on any other relevant document and existing records, conduct proceedings in accordance with section 14(1) and cause a survey to be carried out and determine the dispute…It is only after determining the dispute can parties move to court to challenge it.”






68.
Having found that the dispute herein ought to have been referred to the Land Registrar, and also considering that the Surveyor’s Report indicated that there was a road running along land parcels nos 342, 349, 350 and 367 and many others which could have affected the sizes of these parcels of land, this court finds that it was not certain that the Appellant had occupied the land parcel No.  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349,  which is registered in the name of the Respondent herein.






69.
There was also undisputed evidence that the Appellant and her family have been in occupation and possession of the disputed parcel of land since 1977. The Respondent has not been in occupation, of the said parcel of land and for a family that has been in long occupation of a portion of land to be dislodged, then it should be very clear that they are occupying another person’s parcel of land. That ascertainment can only be done by the Land Registrar, who has such mandate as per the 
Land Registration Act
.






70.
As submitted by the Appellant, the Surveyor’s Report is contradictory as on one hand it stated that the Respondent’s land was affected by the road, and then on another hand it stated that the Appellant wrongly entered into and developed the Respondent parcel of land. Therefore this court finds wholy that the trial court could not rely only on the Surveyor’s Report to come to a conclusion that the Appellant had encroached on the Respondent’s parcel of land being Kakuzi/ Kirimiri Block 8/ 349.






71.
The best available option was for the Land Registrar to visit the disputed parcels of land and fix the boundaries and identify each proprietors parcels of land on the ground. As was held by the Court of Appeal in the case of Estate of Sonrisa ltd Another(Supra)  it is only after determining the dispute that parties can move to court to challenge it”.






72.
The boundary dispute herein ought to have been referred to and resolved by the Land Registrar in the first instance, which was not the case herein. This court has found and held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear the boundary dispute herein as filed by the Respondent. This court too has re-analysed and re- considered the available evidence before the trial court, and finds that the said evidence was not sufficient to sustain the Respondent’s claim and/or proof it on the required standard of balance of probabilities.






73.
For the above reasons, this court finds that the instant Appeal is merited, and thus the same is allowed entirely. Further the trial court’s Judgement delivered on 16
th
 August 2023, and all consequential orders be and are hereby vacated and / or set aside, and the Respondent’s claim before the trial court is dismissed, safe for a finding that he is the holder of the Certificate of title for  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 349, which the Appellant herein is the holder of Certificate of title for  Kakuzi/ Kirimiri/ Block 8/ 351.






74.
On the issue of costs, the court finds that section 27 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 is very clear that costs are awarded at the discretion of the court. However, costs follow the event, and are awarded to the successful litigant. The Appellant is the successful litigant, and is thus awarded costs of this Appeal together with costs of the trial court’s suit.




It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
Before court is the applicant’s motion dated 26 July 2024. It is expressed to be brought under Articles 10, 47 and 227 of the Constitution; Sections 7, 8,9,10 and 11 of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015; Sections 8 and 9 of the Law Reform Act, cap. 26; and, Order 53 Rule of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010. The applicant seeks the following orders:
“


1.
An order of Certiorari to remove into the High Court and quash the Respondent's decision dated 9
th
 July 2024 in Public Procurement Administrative Review Board Application No. 54 of 2024 in respect of Tender No: JUD/OT/048/2023-2024 for Supply, Delivery, Testing and Commissioning of Active Network Devices (Switches and Access Points) Under Framework Contract for a Period of Two (2) Years.






2.
An order of Mandamus directing the Respondent to hear and determine on merit Request for Review Number 54 of 2024 challenging the award of the tender to the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Interested Parties.”


The applicant also seeks the order that the costs of this application be borne by the respondent and interested parties.






2.
The application is based on a statutory statement dated 24 July 2024 and an affidavit verifying the facts relied upon sworn on even date by Mr. Henry Kamau who has sworn that he is the applicant’s chief executive officer.






3.
According to the applicant, the 2
nd
 interested party advertised a tender described as “Tender No.: JUD/OT/048/2023-2024 for Supply, Delivery, Testing and Commissioning of Active Network Devices (Switches and Access Pints) Under Framework Contract for a period of Two (2) years, renewable annually (once) Subject to Satisfactory Performance.” I will henceforth refer to the tender simply as “the tender”. As the description of the tender denotes, the tender was to run for a period of two (2) years but renewable for a one-year term, subject to satisfactory performance of the tender. The applicant was amongst the tenderers but its tender was unsuccessful for the reason that certain documents described as SD 1and SD2 were not signed by the donnee of the power of attorney.






4.
The applicant challenged the 1
st
 interested party’s decision in request for review no. 42 of 2024. On 30 May 2024, the respondent set aside the 1
st
 interested party’s decision of the intention to award the tender and directed the 1
st
 interested party to issue all tenderers with a fresh notification that complied with section 87 of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act. Being dissatisfied with this decision, the applicant filed in this Honourable Court judicial review application no. E130 of 2024 challenging the decision. In a judgment delivered on 26 July 2024, and for reasons given in that judgment, I dismissed the application with costs.






5.
In the meantime, the 1
st
 interested party complied with the respondent's decision in request for review number 42 of 2024 and issued to the applicant a notification of intention to award dated 31 May 2024 informing it that its tender was unsuccessful and further indicated that Lots 1 and 2 of the tender had been awarded to the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Interested Parties respectively.Amongst other requirements in the Tender document, the Technical Evaluation Criteria required the tenderer to provide a valid Manufacturer's Authorization Form (MAF) and one (1) year standard warranty for all devices and software if the bidder was not a manufacturer.






6.
The notification of intention to award indicated that the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Interested Parties offered Cisco devices and software. It was, therefore, a requirement for the said interested parties to submit MAFs and requisite warranty letters from Cisco showing that they were ‘authorized channel partners’ and, therefore, legally authorized by the manufacturer to represent the manufacturer in selling their products, services and solutions and conforming with all the legal, security and regulatory requirements.






7.
The applicant enquired from Cisco on 6 June 2024 whether it had issued MAFs and warranties to the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 interested parties authorising them to participate in the tender as a Cisco partner. Cisco wrote back to the applicant on 12 June 2024 and stated that the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 interested parties were not certified Cisco channel partners and, therefore, were not entitled to purchase and resell Cisco products or services. Armed with this information, the applicant protested the award of the tender to the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 interested parties on the ground that the said interested parties were not authorised to purchase and resell Cisco products or services. The applicant’s protest was contained in a letter dated 13 June 2024.






8.
The applicant followed the protest with a request for review of the 1
st
 interested party’s decision filed before the respondent as application no. 54 of 2024. In its decision rendered on 9 July 2024, the respondent struck out the request for review on the ground that the same was filed outside the 14-day statutory timeline contrary to provisions of section 167 of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act and regulation 203 (2) of the regulations made under the Act. Accordingly, the respondent held, it was divested of jurisdiction to hear and determine the request for review.






9.
The applicant is aggrieved by the respondent’s decision, hence this application. According to the applicant, the respondent failed to interpret section 167(1) of the Act correctly. Contrary to the respondent’s holding, it is the applicant’s case that the request for review was filed within time because the decision, the subject matter of the request for review, was communicated through the 1
st
 interested party's letter dated 31 May 2024 and served upon the applicant on 4 June 2024. The applicant contends that the request for review was filed on 11 June 2024, well within the fourteen-day period prescribed by section 167 of the Act.






10.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 interested parties filed a replying affidavit opposing the application. It was sworn on their behalf by Mr. Jeremiah Nthusi, the judiciary’s director of supply chain management services. According to Mr. Nthusi, the Judiciary invited sealed bids from eligible tenderers through the national open tender competitive method on 22 February 2024 for Tender No. JUDIOT/048/2023-2024 for the Supply, Delivery, Testing and Commissioning of Active Network Devices (Switches and Access Pints) Under Framework Contract for a period of Two (2) years, renewable annually (once) Subject to Satisfactory Performance.






11.
At the closure of the tender, more particularly on 7 March 2024, the 2
nd
 interested received bids from the the applicant and fourteen other tenderers whose bids were duly recorded and evaluated strictly in accordance with the law and the Tender Document. At the preliminary evaluation stage, it was noted that the applicant submitted mandatory Self Declaration Forms (Form SD1 and SD2) which were made and signed by two separate people. According to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 interested parties, this was not the proper way to depose and sign a self declaration and, for this reason, the applicant's bid was declared non-responsive at the preliminary stage.






12.
At the conclusion of the evaluation, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 interested parties settled on the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 interested parties as the successful bidders and sent to all bidders its Letters of Notification of Intention to Award the tender to the two successful bidders.The applicant, being aggrieved by the decision of the 2
nd
 interested party to award the tender to the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 interested parties, lodged a request for review No. 42 of 2024 before the respondent. The request for review was founded on the grounds, inter alia, that the 2
nd
 interested party did not comply with the law in declaring the applicant’s bid non-responsive at the Preliminary Stage of evaluation on the basis that its statutory declaration forms were not properly filled and signed; and, that the letters of Notification of Award issued by the 2
nd
 interested party to the bidders at the conclusion of evaluation process did not comply with the law.






13.
In its decision dated 30 May 2024, the respondent allowed the request for review to the extent that the notifications of the intention to award the tender were found to be not in accordance with the law. The respondent dismissed the contention that the 2
nd
 respondent wrongfully declared the applicant’s bid as non-responsive at the preliminary stage. The respondent then directed the 2
nd
 interested party to issue fresh Letters of Notification of Award to the applicant clarifying the reasons why its bid had been rejected, and to proceed with the tender process accordingly. On its part, the 2
nd
 interested party complied with the decision and directions of the respondent and issued the fresh Notification of Award to the applicant.






14.
The applicant challenged the decision of the respondent in this Honourable Court in application no. E130 of 2024 but, as noted, the application was dismissed on 26 July 2024. In the meantime, upon receiving the fresh Notification of Award issued by the 2
nd
 interested party pursuant to the decision application no. 42 of 2054, the applicant lodged a fresh request for review before the respondent, being application no. 54 of 2024. In that application, the applicant challenged the award of the tender to the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 interested parties on the grounds that the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 interested parties did not submit genuine Manufacturer Authentication Forms which were mandatory requirements in the tender. The respondent determined and dismissed this latter request for review on 9 July 2024. The respondent’s decision was sent to parties via e-mail on even date. The applicant contends that the instant application ought to have been filed on or before 23 July 2024 since according to law, the application is to be filed within 14 days of the date of the respondent’s decision. The applicants application having been filed on 24 July 2024 was thus filed outside time.






15.
Apart from being caught by limitation of time, the applicant’s application was also struck out in limine because the request was res judicata and sub judice. The issues raised in application no. 54 of 2024 , according to the applicant, had been raised and determined, or ought to have been raised for determination, in application no. 42 of 2024. The respondent also opined that, determining application no. 54 of 2024 when this Honourable Court was seized of a judicial review application challenging the respondent’s decision in application no. 42 of 2024, would expose the respondent and the this Honourable Court to embarrassment if they reached conflicting decisions arising from challenges to the same tender.






16.
According to the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 interested parties, the respondent was well within its right to raise the issue of jurisdiction on its own motion and to determine it without necessarily inviting submissions from the parties. Again, the respondent did not incorrectly interpret the provisions of Section 167(1) of the Public Procurement & Asset Disposal Act as alleged by the applicant or at all to the extent that the respondent found that the second request for review was filed out of time.






17.
I have considered the submissions filed by the parties in support of the positions with respect to the application before court. A substantial part of these submissions is made up of what parties have averred in their respective pleadings and deposed in affidavits sworn in support of or in opposition to the application.






18.
To begin with, in determining this application, I need state at the very outset that the point of entry for a judicial review court to intervene and check the powers of subordinate courts or tribunals or such other bodies whose powers are subject to judicial review is the grounds upon which the application for judicial review reliefs is made. Order 53 Rule 1(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules states in mandatory terms that the statement accompanying the application must contain, among other things, the grounds upon which the application is made. It reads as follows:
(2)
2) An application for such leave as aforesaid shall be made ex parte to a judge in chambers, and shall be accompanied by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought, 
and the grounds on which it is sought, and by affidavits verifying the facts relied on.
 (Emphasis added).
And Order 53 Rule 4(1) of those rules states unambiguously that at the hearing of the motion, no grounds should be relied upon except those specified in the statement accompanying the application for leave.






19.
The grounds to which reference has been made in these provisions of the law have not been left to speculation. They were enunciated in the English case of Council of Civil Service Unions versus Minister for the Civil Service (1985) A.C. 374,410. In that case, Lord Diplock set out the three heads which he described as “the grounds upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review”. These grounds are illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. While discussing susceptibility of administrative actions to judicial review and, in the process defining these grounds, the learned judge stated as follows:
“
My Lords, I see no reason why simply because a decision-making power is derived from a common law and not a statutory source, it should for that reason only be immune from judicial review. Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call “illegality,” the second “irrationality” and the third “procedural impropriety.” That is not to say that further development on a case by case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of “proportionality” which is recognised in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community; but to dispose of the instant case the three already well-established heads that I have mentioned will suffice.
By “illegality” as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.
By “irrationality” I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as “Wednesbury unreasonableness” (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 K.B. 223). It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. Whether a decision falls within this category is a question that judges by their training and experience should be well equipped to answer, or else there would be something badly wrong with our judicial system. To justify the court's exercise of this role, resort I think is today no longer needed to Viscount Radcliffe's ingenious explanation in Edwards v. Bairstow [1956] A.C. 14 of irrationality as a ground for a court's reversal of a decision by ascribing it to an inferred though unidentifiable mistake of law by the decision-maker. “Irrationality” by now can stand upon its own feet as an accepted ground on which a decision may be attacked by judicial review.
I have described the third head as “procedural impropriety” rather than failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice. But the instant case is not concerned with the proceedings of an administrative tribunal at all.”






20.
These grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety are ordinarily regarded as the traditional grounds for judicial review. The court will intervene and may grant the remedy for judicial review if any of them is proved to exist. But as Lord Diplock suggested, the list is by no means exhaustive. The learned judge hastened to say that further development of this area of law may yield further grounds on a case by case basis. It is in this spirit, the learned judge suggested, that the principle of proportionality, as a further ground for judicial review, has been developed.
Since they form the foundation upon which the application for judicial review is based, these grounds must be stated in precise, clear and unambiguous terms in the statement accompanying the application for leave.






21.
While reiterating the importance of stating grounds for judicial review in concise and precise terms, Michael Fordham in his book, Judicial Review Handbook, at Paragraph 34.1 states as follows:
“
The need to identify and express accurately the possible grounds for judicial review is not simply a matter of analytical nicety. It is one of practical necessity. The provisions of the new order require the accurate identification of (a) potentially applicable grounds and (b) the time at which they arose. Given the frequent presence of multiple targets, the elusive nature of certain grounds, their disarming interrelationship, and the understandable fear of missed opportunity, it is easy to see why public lawyers may feel tempted to ‘throw everything’ including grounds which are dangerously close to the inconceivable. This approach is unlikely to endear them to the court.”






22.
The ‘new order’ referred to in this passage is Order 53 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of England whose provisions are, more or less, in pari materia with our own Order 53 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010. The point is, however, clear that courts will not entertain applications where grounds have not been identified and accurately stated. Stating the grounds in precise terms is not, as it were, a matter of analytical nicety but it is a practical necessity. It follows that where the grounds are not stated, the application is fatally defective as, strictly speaking, it has no foundation upon which it is built.






23.
Against this background, I must state that I have struggled to single out any of the judicial review grounds in the applicant’s statement. A substantial part of what has been stated as the grounds for which relief is sought constitute the facts that would, ordinarily, be verified by an affidavit. The closest the applicant has come to stating the grounds is what it is contained in paragraphs 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the statement under the head of “grounds for the reliefs sought”. In those paragraphs, the applicant has stated as follows:
“
12)
The Applicant is aggrieved by the 1
st
 Respondent's decision and seeks to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this honorable court because in arriving at the impugned decision, the Respondent failed to correctly interpret the provisions of section 167 (1) of the Act.
13)
The Respondent failed to exercise its discretion reasonably and in good faith by failing to invite the parties to submit on whether the request for review was time barred since the 1?? and 2
nd
 Interested Parties had not challenged the Board's jurisdiction to entertain the request for review.
14)
By the said impugned decision, the Respondent improperly fettered its discretion by failing to exercise powers conferred on it under section 173 of the Act and therefore acted ultra vires the Act.
15)
The 1
st
 Respondent's conduct amounts to breach of the rule of law, the Applicant's legitimate expectation and fair administrative action under Articles 10 and 47 of the Constitution as read together with the provisions of the Fair Administrative Action Act.
16)
The impugned decision is misconceived, erroneous and an illegality having been rendered based on the erroneous interpretation of section 167 (1) of the Act as read together with Article 227 (1) of the Constitution.”






24.
Even then, it is not easy to tell from these pleadings which of the grounds of judicial review the applicant’s application is based. The applicant has, in a way, ‘thrown everything to court’ and left it to make out what these grounds are. Considering that Order 53 Rule 4(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules expressly states that no grounds should be relied upon except those specified in the statement accompanying the application for leave, the applicant’s application would fail because it is not open to the court to speculate the grounds of judicial review for which relief is sought.






25.
That said, my understanding of what has been presented as grounds for judicial review is that the applicant is, more or less, questioning the merits of the respondent’s decision rather than the process by which the decision was reached. When the applicant says, for instance, that “ the Applicant is aggrieved by the 1
st
 Respondent's decision and seeks to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this honorable court because in arriving at the impugned decision, the Respondent failed to correctly interpret the provisions of section 167 (1) of the Act”, there should be no doubt that it is appealing against the decision in an application that has been camouflaged as a judicial review application.






26.
It is not in dispute that judicial review jurisdiction is separate and distinct from appellate jurisdiction and neither is an alternate to the other. This distinction has been discussed by David Foulkes in his book Foulkes Administrative Law, 7
th
 Edition. Citing the case of Customs and Excise Commissioners versus J.H. Corbitt (Numismatists) Ltd (1981) AC 22, (1980) 2 2ALL ER 72, the learned author noted as follows:
“
It is to be noted that an appeal lies from, whether to an appellate tribunal or to a court of law, only when and to the extent that statute so provides, and the powers of the appeal body to review, reconsider etc. the decision of the tribunal likewise depend on the statute.
To be contrasted with appeal is judicial review. The decision of tribunals, as bodies exercising judicial functions, have always been subject to review by the courts (that is, to judicial review) by means of the order of certiorari. This enables the court to quash a decision on certain grounds. Whereas appeal lies only when and to the extent that statute provides, the court’s common law power of judicial review exists unless it is taken away or limited by statute. Thus where no appeal to the court is provided by statute the only possible challenge in the courts is by way of judicial review…” (at p.150-151).
And for avoidance of doubt that judicial review cannot be assumed to be an appeal, Lord Widgery CJ in R versus Peterkin, ex Soni (1972) Imm AR 253 noted as follows:
“
The prerogative orders form the general residual jurisdiction of this court whereby the court supervises the work of inferior tribunals and seeks to correct injustice where no other adequate remedy exists,
 but both authority and common sense seem to me to demand that the court should not allow its jurisdiction under the prerogative orders to be used merely as an alternative form of appeal when other and adequate jurisdiction exists elsewhere”. (Emphasis added).






27.
Judicial review would be concerned about the process and not the merits of the decision in issue. That being the case, a judicial review court will not fault the respondent for interpreting section 167(1) of the Act, or any other provision of the law for that matter, because a judicial review court has no jurisdiction to substitute its own opinion for that of a tribunal. Needless to say, it is not part of the purpose for judicial review to substitute the opinion of the judiciary or of individual judges for that of the authority constituted by law to decide the matters in question (see Lord Hailsham in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police versus Evans (1982) 1 WLR 1155 at 1160F).






28.
This point has been emphasised in 
R versus Entry Clearance Officer, Bombay ex p Amin (1983) 818 at 829 (B-C) per Lord Fraser
 that judicial review is entirely different from an ordinary appeal. It is made effective by the court quashing an administrative decision without substituting its own decision, and it is to be contrasted with an appeal where the appellate tribunal substitutes its own decision on the merits for that of the administrative officer.






29.
The same point was emphasised in Chief Constable of North Wales Police versus Evans (supra) where Lord Brightman said at page 1173F and 1174G that:
“
Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision-making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power…Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made
.”
Lord Hailsham stated in the same case that:
“
The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment, and not to ensure that the authority, after according fair treatment, reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a conclusion which is correct in the eyes of the court.” At page 1161A.
On his part Lord Roskil said in R versus Inland Revenue Commissioners ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd 1982(AC) 617 at 633C that:
“
The court must not cross that boundary between administration whether good or bad which is lawful and what is unlawful performance of a statutory duty.”






30.
Of course, where the impugned decision is outrightly illegal; in defiance of express provisions of the law or cannot stand to reason or rationality, the court will interfere not necessarily to substitute its own decision with that of the tribunal but because the decision is impeachable on all or any of the grounds of judicial review. This point was made by the Court of Appeal in Biren Amritlal Shah & anor vs. Republic & 3 others [2013] eKLR where it was stated thus:
“
The learned Judge would only have been entitled to interfere were it the case that there was absolutely no evidence before the Board that would have justified the upholding of the appellant’s termination of the tender. In other words, the case should have been so plainly and self-evidently devoid of evidence or basis for termination, as to render upholding of the termination an inexplicable act of capricious irrationality defiant of all logic and reason. It should have been such a decision that no reasonable tribunal, properly directing itself on the case would have arrived at. That is the Wednesbury unreasonableness that would invalidate a tribunal’s decision by way of certiorari.”






31.
Against this background, I find no basis for faulting the respondent’s decision questioning the applicant’s conduct of filing piecemeal, requests for review, when, after consideration of the material before it, the issues raised in request for review no. 54 of 2024 could, and ought to have been raised in review no. 42 of 2024. For the same reason there is no basis of questioning the respondent’s holding that the subsequent request for review by the applicant could or may well have been sub judice considering that this Honourable Court was seized of a dispute initiated by the applicant against the respondent over issues that either arose or could possibly arise in request for review no. 54 of 2024. To quote the respondent at paragraphs 88 and 89 of its decision, it held as follows:
“


88.
Turning to the circumstances in the instant Request for Review, as chronicled hereinbefore, this Board in directing the Respondent to re­issue a compliant letter of notification also addressed its mind to and determined the very issue that the Applicant seeks to re-litigate vide the instant application. We have carefully reviewed the re-issued notification letter dated 31
st
 May 2024 and find nothing therein to suggest that the procuring entity undertook a fresh evaluation or indeed made any other decision that would warrant the fresh invocation of the jurisdiction of this Board on the merits of the procurement process. It bears emphasis in this regard t
hat the substantive matters raised by the Applicant to impugn the procurement process were either already raised or ought to have been raised by the Applicant in Application No. 42 of 2024 and are accordingly time barred for the same were the subject of events that occurred well before 31st May 2024 and at best res judicata as the same were heard and determined by a decision of this board in Application No. 42 of 2024 involving both parties as to this Application.






89.
furthermore, it has been brought to the attention of the Board that the Applicant has filed a similar application No. HCJR No. E130 of 2024 before the High Court seeking the same or substantially the same reliefs as before us. The Applicant did not contest this allegation and/or submission. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the Respondent, to entertain the matter under such circumstances exposes this board and the court to the risk of unnecessary embarrassment in the administration of justice should two different orders be issued by the Board and the High Court. For good order in order in the administration of justice in the Circumstances, the logical consequence, of the Applicant’s actions in litigating the ,same dispute before different fora is for the inferior court or tribunal (read this Board) to cede jurisdiction to the superior court. We are guided on this decision by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Law Society of Kenya v Attorney General & another (Petition 4 of 2019) [2019] KESC 16 (KLR) (Civ) (3 December 2019) (Judgment)…”








32.
In summary, therefore, even if one was to assume that the applicant seeks judicial review reliefs on all the grounds of judicial review, there is no material before the court to support any of those grounds. To be precise, as far as the ground of illegality is concerned, I am not satisfied that the respondent can be said to have misunderstood the law that regulates its decision-making power or that it did not give effect to it.






33.
Similarly, on the ground of irrationality, no material has been provided by the applicant to demonstrate that the 1
st
 respondent’s decision is “so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it”.






34.
And finally, on procedural impropriety, the applicant was given opportunity to be heard before the respondent came to its decision. In particular, there is sufficient evidence in the respondent’s decision showing that the applicant was granted opportunity to address and, indeed it did address the respondent on the question of whether its request for review was res judicata and sub judice. This is apparent from paragraphs 36 and 38 of the respondent’s decision where the applicant’s submissions were captured as follows:
“


36.
As to whether the instant Request for Review is res Judicata, the Applicant submitted that the ground for review in the instant Request for Review is that the Interested Parties did not meet the mandatory requirements under paragraphs 2 and 4 of Stage 2A of the Technical Evaluation Criteria. The Applicant further submitted that the Board in its decision dated 30
th
 May 2024 in Request for Review No. 42 of 2024 quashed the first notification letter on the ground that the Respondents had failed to inform it of the name of the successful bidder in lot 1 and therefore, it was not possible at that point in time for the Applicant to raise the issue raised in the instant Request for Review in Request for Review No. 42 of 2024.






38.
As to whether the instant Request for Review is sub Judice, the Applicant submitted that what the Board ought to consider is whether the issue before it in the instant Request for Review and the issue before the High Court, being whether the Board arrived at a correct decision in holding that Forms S01 and 5D2 as submitted by the Applicant did not meet the tender requirements, is the same for the subJudice rule to apply.”








35.
The questions of res judicata and sub judice obviously provoked the question of whether, if request for review no. 54 of 2024 was res judicata and sub judice, the respondent could assume jurisdiction and dispose of the application on merits. The applicant cannot, therefore, be heard to suggest that it was not given the opportunity to raise the question of jurisdiction to the extent that the question of jurisdiction was intertwined with the question of res judicata and sub judice. Jurisdiction was not just about the timing of the filing of the request for review but it is a question that was intertwined with the concepts of res judicata and sub judice. This point is, however, moot because, as noted earlier, the applicant has not raised the ground of procedural impropriety as one of the grounds upon which its application is based.






36.
In the final analysis, I am not satisfied that the applicant’s application is a proper one for grant of the reliefs of judicial review. It is hereby dismissed with costs. It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The deceased, Simon Muriithi Ndungu, died in a road traffic accident that occurred on 24
th
 July, 2009 along Makutano Makuyu Road. The accident involved the Appellant’s motor vehicle registration KAW 873V, driven at the time by the appellant’s agent, which collided with motor vehicle registration number KAS 514K, owned by the 4
th
 Respondent. The motor vehicle KAW 873V is registered in the name of the 3
rd
 Respondent. The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents, as administrators ad-litem of the deceased’s estate, sued the Appellant and the 3rd Respondent for general and special damages in Milimani CMC Civil Case No. 513 of 2012. Interlocutory judgment was entered against the 3
rd
 Respondent. The 4
th
 Respondent was enjoined as a Third Party.






2.
Upon hearing the claim, the trial court held the Appellant and the 3
rd
 Respondent herein 100% jointly and severally liable for the accident and awarded the 1
st
 and 2nd Respondent damages as follows: Kshs. 50,000/= as general damages for pain and suffering, Kshs. 220,000/= for loss of expectation of life, Kshs. 1,72, 933/= for loss of dependency and Kshs. 820/= as special damages, together with the costs of the suit plus interests.






3.
The Appellant lodged an appeal in this court, aggrieved by the said decision. The appeal challenges the trial court’s finding on liability and assessment of the quantum of damages.






4.
In her memorandum of appeal dated May 21
st
, 2020, the Appellant raised 11 grounds of appeal which can be summarized as follows:
1.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in giving a narrow interpretation of the facts, leading to an erroneous assessment of the issue of liability.
2.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact as she failed to take into account the issue of liability which was not proved by the Respondents against the Appellant.
3.
That the learned magistrate erred in failing to consider the law on negligence and thereby erroneously finding the Appellant to blame at 100% liability.
4.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact because she found as a fact that two different vehicles were to blame equally for the accident, and yet she proceeded to blame the Appellants at 100% in her final findings.
5.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding general damages when there was no legal basis for the award.
6.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding general damages that were so excessive as to amount to abuse of discretion.
7.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in applying wrong principles in awarding general damages.
8.
The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in totally ignoring the law and the submissions put in by the appellant thereby arriving at a wrong decision on quantum of damages.
9.
That the learned magistrate misdirected herself on the applicable measure of award of general damages in favor of the Respondents.
10.
That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact in awarding damages that were so excessive as to represent an erroneous estimate of the loss suffered.
11.
That the judgment of the learned magistrate is against the law and weight of the evidence on record.






5.
The appeal was canvassed by written submissions, which this court gave due consideration to.






Issues for determination


6.
The issues for determination are whether the learned trial magistrate erred in holding the Appellant liable, the apportionment of liability, and whether the damages awarded by the trial magistrate amount to an erroneous estimate.






7.
Being a first appeal, the court relies on a number of principles as set out in Selle and another v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd and others [1968] 1 EA 123:
“
…this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities materially to estimate the evidence ...”






Whether the learned trial magistrate erred in apportioning liability against the Appellant and 3
rd
 Respondent jointly and severally?


8.
The general rule is that a trial court’s finding on apportionment of liability should not be interfered with save in exceptional cases as it is an exercise of discretion. In Khambi and another v Mahithi and another [1968] EA 70, it was held thus: -
“
It is well settled that where a trial judge has apportioned liability according to the fault of the parties his apportionment should not be interfered with on appeal, save in exceptional cases, as where there is some error in principle or the apportionment is manifestly erroneous, and an appellate court will not consider itself free to substitute its own apportionment for that made by the trial judge.”






9.
The Appellant disputes the trial court’s finding that apportioned liability at 100% jointly and severally against the Appellant and the 3
rd
 Respondent. She argues that this finding was erroneous because the OB extract and the police officer who testified in court indicated that the motor vehicle, KAS 514K, was to blame. Based on this evidence, the Appellant argues that the lower court should have placed liability on the driver of motor vehicle KAS 514K. She contends that the court should have found the 4
th
 Respondent (third party) solely liable for the accident as per the police abstract and the testimony of the police officer. In the alternative, the Appellant has asked the court to apportion liability equally between herself and the 4th Respondent.






10.
I have examined the evidence before the trial court. It was established that an accident occurred involving the two vehicles, KAS 514K and KAW 873V. The deceased died as a result of the accident; he was a passenger in motor vehicle KAS 514K. The police officer who testified and produced the police abstract could not explain why any driver should carry more blame than the other. The police OB extract noted, in brackets, that the motor vehicle KAS 514K was to blame. However, the police officer who produced the report did not give the basis for that entry.






11.
The trial court observed as follows;
“
The court has read the OB extract it comprises of a report by officers who visited the scene of accident. In the report, it is stated that the two motor vehicles met head on. There are no further reasons or circumstances given for the accident. Even the point of impact is not stated. In the police abstract, it is stated that the accident is still pending under investigations. In summary, the only evidence before the court is that the vehicles met and collided. It is obvious that the accident occurred for a reason. The reasons are not explained to court by either party. The court thus concludes that both drivers were at fault and contributed to the accident vide negligence. The defendants are therefore found to have caused the accident and found to be 100% liable.”






12.
It was also held in Mwangi v Wambugu [1984] KLR 453 that;
“
An appellate court will not normally interfere with a finding of fact by the trial court unless such finding is based on no evidence or on a misapprehension of the evidence; or where the court has clearly failed on some material point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities material to an estimate of the evidence”.






13.
Although the police suggested that the motor vehicle, KAS 514K, was to blame solely, the lower court concluded that both drivers were at fault and contributed to the accident. This is because the police did not give any explanation to support the entry when the same abstract indicated that the case was pending investigations. In addition, the police officer told the court that both drivers died on the spot, and the police were unable to get an independent witness in their investigations.






14.
In Peter Kanithi Kimunya vs. Aden Guyo Haro [2014] eKLR it was held:
“
A police abstract is not proof of occurrence of an accident but of the fact that following an accident, the occurrence thereof was ‘reported’ at a particular police station.”






15.
The Appellant has taken issue with the learned trial magistrate's failure to apportion liability in a ratio of 50: 50 between her and the fourth Respondent.






16.
In the judgment delivered by the trial court on 30
th
 April, 2020, the learned magistrate held the Appellant and 3
rd
 Respondent 100% jointly and severally liable for the accident. The Appellant faulted the trial court for holding that the Appellant and the 3rd Respondent were jointly and severally liable. Instead, the Appellant argues that liability ought to have been apportioned equally between the Appellant and 4
th
 Respondent on a 50:50 basis.






17.
The High Court in the Nzioka (Suing on her own behalf and as 
Administrator of the Estate of Gideon Mwanthi Nguyo - Deceased) v Mwangangi & another (Civil Appeal 283 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 15711 (KLR) (Civ) (28 November 2022) (Judgment) held as follows:
“
From the above authority, it is evident that by holding the respondents herein 100% jointly and severally liable for the accident, the learned magistrate meant that the Appellants can recover the full judgment sum against either of the Respondents then the one who paid can seek reimbursement from the other. Should that be the case in road traffic accident cases where parties are held equally liable? Definitely not…The record is clear that none of the drivers testified in the trial court and no evidence was tendered from which this court can reasonably determine who was to blame for the accident. In the premises and guided by the above authority I hold the respondents herein liable for the accident in the ratio of 50:50”.






18.
In Lakhanshi v Attorney General [1971] EA 120, Lutta, JA cited with approval the judgment of Lord Denning in Baker v market Harborough Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd [1953], where it was held that:
“
In a situation where a collision had occurred, and it was not reasonably possible on the evidence adduced to decide who was to blame, that liability should be apportioned at 50:50 % as between the two motor vehicles.”






19.
In the present case, the fatal accident occurred in the middle of the road. The facts before the court could not reasonably help the court determine who was to blame for the accident. The trial court observed that;
“
It is the police officer’s testimony that the motor vehicles met head on and collided at the middle of the road. She told the court that both drivers died on the spot, and the police were unable to get an independent witness in their investigations”.






20.
The court is bound by the precedent established in Nzioka (Suing on her own behalf and as Administrator of the Estate of Gideon Mwanthi Nguyo - Deceased) v Mwangangi & another (supra) and finds no reason to depart from them. The two motor vehicles are both to blame for the accident.






21.
The appellant initiated third-party proceedings against the 4th Respondent. The third-party did not enter an appearance. Third party proceedings are provided for in Order 1, rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules;
Notice to third and subsequent parties
“15
(1)
Where a defendant claims as against any other person not already a party to the suit (hereinafter called the third party)—
(a)
that he is entitled to contribution or indemnity; or
(b)
that he is entitled to any relief or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the suit and substantially the same as some relief or remedy claimed by the plaintiff; or
(c)
that any question or issue relating to or connected with the said subject matter is substantially the same question or issue arising between the plaintiff and the defendant and should properly be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but as between the plaintiff and defendant and the third party or between any or either of them, he shall apply to the Court within fourteen days after the close of pleadings for leave of the Court to issue a notice (hereinafter called a third party notice) to that effect, and such leave shall be applied for by summons in chambers ex parte supported by affidavit.
(2)
A copy of such notice shall be filed and shall be served on the third party according to the rules relating to the service of a summons.
(3)
The notice shall state the nature and grounds of the claim, and shall, unless otherwise ordered by the court, be filed within fourteen days of service, and shall be in or to the effect of Form No. 1 of Appendix A with such variations as circumstances require and a copy of the plaint shall be served therewith.’’






22.
On 18th July 2017, the lower court granted leave for service of the third-party notice dated 15th May 2017. An affidavit of service was duly filed by the appellant. The Appellant complied with the requirements for the initiation of third-party proceedings. It is thus a valid third-party notice within the provisions of the Civil Procedure. The third-party failed to enter an appearance, and the rules have provided for the implications of third-party default in entering an appearance.
Order 1, rule 17 provides that;
“If a person not a party to the suit who is served as mentioned in r. 15 (hereinafter called the “third party”) desires to dispute the plaintiff’s claim in the suit as against the defendant on whose behalf the notice has been given, or his own liability to the defendant, the third party must enter an appearance in the suit on or before the day specified in the notice; and in default of his so doing he shall be deemed to admit the validity of the decree obtained against such defendant, whether obtained by consent or otherwise, and his own liability to contribute or indemnify, as the case may be, to the extent claimed in the third party notice:
Provided that a person so served and failing to enter an appearance within the period fixed in the notice may apply to the Court for leave to enter an appearance, and for good cause such leave may be given upon such terms, if any, as the court shall think fit.”
(the emphasis is mine)






23.
The trial court delivered a ruling on the Appellant’s application dated 06th September, 2018 and held that the Appellant’s recourse under Order 1 Rule 17 of the Civil Procedure Rules is stipulated in Rule 19.
Order 1, rule 19 provides as follows;
“Judgment against third party in default.
19.
Where a third party makes default in entering an appearance in the suit, or in delivering any pleading, and the defendant giving the notice suffers judgment by default, such defendant shall be entitled, after causing the satisfaction of the decree against himself to be entered upon the record, to judgment against the third party to the extent claimed in the third-party notice; the court may upon the application of the defendant pass such judgment against the third party before such defendant has satisfied the decree passed against him:
Provided that it shall be lawful for the court to set aside or vary any judgment passed under this rule upon such terms as may seem just.’’






24.
The recourse available to the appellant (as the party who has taken out third-party proceedings) is dependent on the court’s determination of liability and quantum. I agree with the trial court that it could not issue directions on the motion dated 6
th
 September, 2018 because the 4
th
 respondent had not entered appearance. Directions are taken where the third party has entered an appearance.






25.
Additionally, my interpretation of Order 1 Rule 17 is that despite a third party failing to enter an appearance, they are formally joined to the suit by the filing and service of the third-party notice pursuant to leave being granted by the court.






26.
The deceased was travelling in the 4
th
 respondent’s motor vehicle. The evidence before the court is that the 4th respondent (third party in the lower court case) is partially liable for the accident that claimed the deceased’s life. This court has not found fault in the lower court’s finding that the Appellant and the 3
rd
 Respondent were liable for the accident.






27.
Accordingly, the appeal is found to be meritorious on the issue of apportionment of liability. The trial court’s order that the Appellant and the 3
rd
 Respondent are held 100% jointly liable is hereby set aside and substituted with an order that liability is apportioned between the appellant and the 3
rd
 respondent jointly and severally at the ratio of 50% and the 4
th
 respondent at the other ratio of 50%.










Quantum


28.
The Appellant argued that the trial court erred in law and fact in awarding quantum as it did when there was no legal basis for the award. She opines that the trial court’s award for pain and suffering, loss of dependency, and loss of expectation of life was so excessive as to amount to an abuse of discretion.






29.
On pain and suffering, the Appellant urged the court to set aside the award of Kshs. 50, 000/= and replace it with an award of Kshs. 10,000/=. She bases her argument on the fact that the deceased’s death was instantaneous. She relies on the case of Harjeet Singh Pandal v Hellen Aketch Okudho (2018) eKLR where the court set aside an award of Kshs.30,000/- under pain and suffering and substituted it with Kshs.10,000/-






30.
In the case of Mercy Muriuki & another v Samuel Mwangi Nduati & another (Suing as the legal Administrator of the Estate of the late Robert Mwangi) [2019] eKLR, the court observed that
“
Awards for Pain and Suffering range from Kshs 10,000/- to Kshs 100,000/- and higher damages would be awarded if the pain and suffering was prolonged before death (Emphasis by Court)”.






31.
This ought to be contrasted with the court’s finding in Nzioka (Suing on her own behalf and as Administrator of the Estate of Gideon Mwanthi Nguyo - Deceased) v Mwangangi & another, where the deceased had died on the spot. In the case, the court refused to upset the lower court’s award of 50, 000/= for Pain and Suffering. It held that;
“
Given that the sums awardable under this head have ranged from Kshs 10,000/- to Kshs 100,000/- from past precedents, I cannot say that the sum of Kshs. 50,000/- awarded by the trial court is inordinately high or unreasonable as to warrant interference”.






32.
A similar position was held by the High Court in Sukari Industries Limited v Clyde Machimbo Juma [2016] eKLR, where the deceased had died on the spot. The lower court had awarded him Kshs. 50,000/= for pain and suffering, which was challenged at the High Court on the grounds that the amount was unreasonable. The Court held thus;
“
According to various decisions of the High Court, the sums have ranged from Kshs 10,000 to Kshs 100,000 over the last 20 years hence I cannot say that that the sum of Kshs 50,000 awarded under this head is unreasonable.”






33.
Based on the above precedents, I find that the Lower court’s exercise of discretion in this issue was reasonable, and, therefore, I decline to upset the lower court’s finding on the same.








Loss of expectation of Life


34.
Appellant urged the court to take into account that any award made for loss of expectation of life under the 
Law Reform Act
 ought to be deducted from the award made under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
. She argued that, in arriving at its decision, the trial court erred by failing to deduct the award noting that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent would have benefited under two Acts. She argued the court to find that failure by the trial court to deduct the award was erroneous in the circumstances. She submitted that the 200,000/= awarded by the court was inordinately high and persuaded this court to substitute the amount with 80,000/=.






35.
As this is an appeal on quantum of damages, the general principal is that the assessment of damages is within the discretion of the trial court and the appellate court will only interfere where trial court, in assessing damages, erred in principle and either took into account an irrelevant factor or left out a relevant factor or that the award was too high or too low as to amount to an erroneous estimate or that the assessment is based on no evidence (see Kemfro Africa Ltd t/a Meru Express & Another v A. M. Lubia and Another [1982-88] 1 KAR 727, Peter M. Kariuki v Attorney General CA Civil Appeal No. 79 of 2012 [2014]eKLR) and Bashir Ahmed Butt v Uwais Ahmed Khan [1982-88] KAR 5).






36.
Regarding the Appellant’s argument that the Respondents could benefit from two Acts, I believe that the issue of double compensation does not arise in this present case. I associate myself with the High Court’s decision in Sukari Industries Limited v Clyde Machimbo Juma [2016] eKLR, where that court observed that;
“
As regards the argument that the respondent was awarded double compensation, I would do no better than quote what the Court of Appeal stated in Hellen Waruguru Waweru (suing as the legal representative of Peter Waweru Mwenja (Deceased) v Kiarie Shoe Stores Limited NYR CA Civil Appeal No. 22 of 2014 [2015] eKLR that;
[20]
This Court has explained the concept of double compensation in several decisions and it is surprising that some courts continue to get it wrong. The principle is logical enough; duplication occurs when the beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate under the 
Law Reform Act
 and dependants under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
 are the same, and consequently the claim for lost years and dependency will go to the same persons. It does not mean that a claimant under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
 should be denied damages for pain and suffering and loss of expectation of life as these are only awarded under the 
Law Reform Act
, hence the issue of duplication does not arise.”






37.
Thus, based on the above precedent, I uphold the trial court’s award of Kshs. 200,000/- and the prayer to have it substituted with 80, 000/- is hereby disallowed.








Loss of Dependency


38.
The Appellant faulted the lower court’s approach to the calculation of the damages for loss of dependency. She urged the court to set aside the multiplicand adopted by the trial court of Kshs.6,461/= and adopt that of Kshs 4,156/=. Here, the argument was that the trial court erred in law by adopting the minimum wage of a turn boy in a municipality, yet no evidence was found that the deceased worked as a conductor within a municipality.






39.
I have reviewed the evidence before the trial court and found that the 1
st
 and the 2
nd
 Respondents had produced enough evidence to show that the deceased was a conductor. The KRA identity card issued on 20
th
 June, 2005 was produced as evidence that the deceased was employed by Neno Sacco Ltd. as a conductor. In addition, in arriving at the wages of the deceased, the trial court was rightly guided by the minimum wage (monthly) for a conductor within a municipality, which was Kshs.6, 461/= On the point of multiplier, I find that the trial court rightly exercised its discretion in setting the multiplier at 20.






40.
Lastly, the Appellant faults the lower court’s approach to the dependency ratio. She argues that there was no evidence at the lower court to prove dependency because the 1
st
 and the 2
nd
 Respondents did not produce birth certificates showing that the deceased had 2 children. The courts have settled the issue of using birth certificates to prove dependency, especially where the dependants are children. The jurisprudence shows that the Respondents did not have to produce birth certificates.






41.
In Bash Hauliers v Dama Kalume Karisa & another [2020] eKLR, the High Court held that:-
“
37.
Although no birth certificate was produced to show that the deceased was the father of Suleiman Charo Katana, no evidence was called to controvert the said assertion. This court takes judicial notice of the fact that not every child of 4 years of age has a birth certificate as some Kenyan parents do not obtain birth certificates immediately following the birth of their children. This Court therefore finds nothing extraordinary in the said child not having a birth certificate. The burden of proof in this case was on a balance of probabilities and not proof beyond reasonable doubt”.






42.
Similarly, the Court in 
Nation Media Group Limited v Thuo & another (Suing as the Administrators of the Estate of Josephat Nduati Kungu – Deceased) (Civil Appeal 157 of 2019
) [2024] KEHC 4058 (KLR) (26 April 2024) (Judgment) held that;
“
With due respect, and unless the Appellant’s Counsel does not live in this very society, his submission that evidence of marriage was not proved simply because no marriage certificate was produced cannot be a serious one. The same goes to the allegation that paternity of the 1-year-old son was not proved simply because no birth certificate or notification of birth were produced. In any event, it must always be recalled that in civil cases, unlike in criminal proceedings, proof is not on a beyond reasonable doubt basis, but on the basis of balance of probabilities”.






43.
The Court went on to state that;
“
In the circumstances, I am satisfied that even though the evidence presented was not watertight, survivorship and dependency were sufficiently proved to an acceptable standard. The choice of the 2/3 dependency ratio by the Magistrate, though not explained, was therefore, nevertheless, still the correct one. I will also not therefore interfere with it”.






44.
At the lower court, the Appellant did not controvert the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondent’s assertion that the deceased had left behind a widow and 2 children. Thus, I find no good reason to disturb the trial magistrate’s court’s discretion to use the 2/3 dependency ratio. Special damages were pleaded and proved at Kshs.820/=






45.
From the foregoing, I find that;
a.
The Appellant’s appeal only succeeds on liability.
b.
The trial court’s decree that the appellant and 4
th
 respondent are held 100% jointly and severally liable is hereby set aside and substituted with a decree that liability is apportioned between the Appellant and 3rd Respondent jointly and severally at the ratio of 50% and the 4
th
 Respondent at the ratio of 50%.
c.
The appellants’ appeal on the quantum of damages lacks merit and is hereby dismissed.






46.
Since the appeal has partly succeeded, each party will bear it’s own costs of the appeal.




It is so ordered.

nd
 Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of Hon. P. Muholi, Principal Magistrate, delivered on 22nd July, 2022 in Milimani C.M Civil Suit No. 10811 of 2018)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The 1
st
 Respondent was gainfully employed by the Appellant until 26
th
 October, 2018, when he was dismissed. On 13
th
 October, 2018, he was arrested by the Police for inquiry and interrogation about a shoplifting incident that had allegedly occurred at the Appellant’s place of work. The police released him the following day without preferring any charges against him. The next day, on 15
th
 October, 2018, the 2
nd
 Respondent allegedly published defamatory words against him in a WhatsApp Group meant for the supervisors of the Appellant. The 1
st
 Respondent sued the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent for general and exemplary damages for defamation therefrom in Milimani CMCC No. 10811 of 2018.






2.
Upon hearing the claim, the trial court held in favour of the 1
st
 Respondent and awarded him general damages of Kshs.250,000/- and exemplary damages of Kshs.200,000/-. He was also awarded costs and interest.






3.
Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Appellant lodged an appeal in this court, asking the court to set aside the judgment of the lower court. In its Memorandum of Appeal dated 7
th
 August, 2022, the Appellant raises seven grounds of appeal which are as follows:
a.
That the Learned Honorable Magistrate erred in law and fact by entering judgment in favor of the 1
st
 Respondent against the Appellant when on the contrary the Trial Court misapprehended and failed to properly evaluate written submissions by the Appellant and evidence on record.
b.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in failing to take cognizance of the fact that there was no nexus and/or any relationship between the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent.
c.
That the Learned Honorable Magistrate erred in law by failing to find that there was no material evidence presented to the Honorable Court that the alleged WhatsApp group is owned and/or managed by the Appellant.
d.
That the Learned Honorable Magistrate erred in law and in fact in holding that the 1
st
 Respondent had proved his claim for alleged defamation on a balance of probabilities.
e.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law by awarding the 1
st
 Respondent General Damages of Kshs 250, 000 Exemplary Damages of Kshs. 200 000 plus costs of the suit and interest.
f.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to sufficiently appreciate that the 1
st
 Respondent’s evidence was purely based on falsehoods, hearsay, gaps, and hypothesis with no basis at all.
g.
That the Honorable Magistrate erred in law and fact by making conclusions that are not supported by evidence on record.






4.
The appeal was canvased by way of written submissions, for which this court gave due consideration.






The Appellant’s Case


5.
The Appellant submitted that there was no nexus and/or any relationship between the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent. It also argued that there was no material evidence presented to the trial court to show that the alleged WhatsApp group was owned and/or managed by the Appellant. In addition, the Appellant submitted that its actions (which has been denied) was motivated by the desire to safeguard public interest in demanding for honest employees as well as to inculcate discipline to dishonest employees. It also submitted that the 1
st
 Respondent did not adduce evidence to show that he was subjected to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, or caused him to be avoided. It also submitted that the words amounted to fair comment on a matter of public interest; they were published in good faith and were accompanied by assertions of truth and fair comment and were not defamatory at all.








The 1
st
 Respondent’s Case


6.
The 1
st
 Respondent submitted that there was a nexus between the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent in that the latter was an employee of the former. He submitted that the Appellant’s contention that it did not own the said WhatsApp group beats logic since the same is run by its supervisors. He further submitted that the said comments were not fair comments and that he had proved his case against the Appellant on a balance of probabilities.








Issues for Determination
a.
Whether there was a nexus between the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent
b.
Whether the defense of fair comment is available to the Appellants






Whether there was a nexus between the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent


7.
The 1
st
 Respondent submitted that the 2
nd
 Respondent was an employee and/or officer of the Appellant at the time of the alleged publication. He also alleged that it was the 2
nd
 Respondent who published or caused the publication of the alleged defamatory words. The Appellant, however, denies that the 2
nd
 Respondent was their employee.






8.
This being a first appeal, it is the duty of the Court to review the evidence adduced before the lower court and satisfy itself that the decision was well-founded. In Selle & Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123, this principle was enunciated thus:
“
...this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court ... is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect...""






9.
The role of the 2
nd
 Respondent in the alleged publication of the defamatory statement was heavily contested at the hearing in the lower court. In his examination-in-chief, the 1
st
 Respondent said ‘I know Henry Kioko, he was the operations manager.’ This statement was not controverted on cross-examination. In re-examination, he stated that ‘Henry is the General Manager. I did not work as the Human Resource in the Company.’ On the other hand, DW1, the H.R. Manager of the Appellants, stated in examination-in-chief, ‘I have never met Mr. Kioko. We do not have a General Manager, instead we have an operations manager.’ The trial court considered the two versions and believed the version given by the 1
st
 Respondent.






10.
The lower court did not place high premiums on the role of the 2
nd
 Respondent in the alleged publication of the defamatory statement. Instead, the court found that the publication was made in a WhatsApp group of the Appellant’s supervisors, irrespective of who published the statement. The court observed, ‘Whoever published the words knew that they were not true in regard to the Plaintiff.’ Thus, the Court held that the Appellant published the defamatory Statement, even though it could not single out who among the Appellant’s supervisors posted the defamatory statement.






11.
I have relooked at the evidence before me and have formed the opinion that the Appellant cannot detach itself from the defamatory publication. The information contained in the published statement points to the observation that the statement's author had access to precise employment details of the Appellant’s employees. The author must have been a custodian of the Appellant’s employee records, including their respective employee numbers and information that could not have been available to a stranger. Notably, the accuracy of the employee’s details in the defamatory statement was not controverted during the trial. In my view, the 1
st
 Respondent proved that it was more probable that the Appellant’s employee authored the defamatory message than an outsider.






12.
During the hearing, the 1
st
 Respondent stated that at the time of his dismissal in 2018, Mr. Kioko, the 2
nd
 Respondent, was the operating manager. In his examination-in-chief, he stated, ‘I know Henry Kioko, he was the operations manager.’ When the Appellant’s HR Manager took to the stand on 21
st
 September, 2021 (about three years after the 1
st
 Respondent left the Company), he confirmed that the company’s organizational structure has the operations manager position. He did not controvert the 1
st
 Respondent’s evidence that Mr. Kioko was holding that position in 2018 when the defamatory statement was said to have been published.






13.
The Court is entitled to look at the evidence and the circumstances. The totality of such evidence and circumstances persuades me to hold that the 2
nd
 Respondent published the defamatory statement, and he published it within the course and scope of his official duties as the Appellant’s employee.






14.
It then follows that the Appellant is vicariously liable for tortious acts of the 2
nd
 Respondent.






15.
The court in National Social Security Fund Board of Trustees v Ankhan Holdings Limited & 2 Others [2006] eKLR cited with approval the decision of the House of Lords in Williams and Another v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd and another [1998] 2 All ER 577 at 582 which held that:
“
Whether the principal is a company or a natural person, someone acting on his behalf may incur personal liability in tort as well as imposing vicarious or attributed liability upon his principal.”






16.
In the case of Tabitha Nduhi Kinyua vs Francis Mutua Mbuvi & Another Civil Appeal No. 186 of 2009 [2014] eKLR the court stated:-
“
The principle of vicarious liability is an anomaly in our law because it imposes strict liability on an employer for the delict of its employee in circumstances in which the employer is not itself at fault. An employer will be held to be vicariously liable if its employee was acting within the course and scope of employment at the time the delict was committed…”






17.
As to whether an employer can be held vicariously liable for defamatory actions of his employees, I am guided by in Gatley & Lindsell on slander and Libel 11th Ed. at page 197, as was quoted in Sicily K. Kariuki v Standard Group PLC & 6 Others [2020] eKLR:-
“
An action for defamation is purely a personal action. The proper person to sue as a claimant is the person defamed and the proper person to be sued as the defendant is the person who published the defamatory words or caused them to be published (though this may include a person vicariously liable for another)”








Whether the Defense of Fair Comment is available to the Appellants


18.
In Halsbury’s Laws of England Fourth Edition Vol. 28 page 45, paragrapgh 145, the authors state;
“
The defences of both fair comment and qualified privilege are defeated by proof that the defendant published the words complained of maliciously. In both cases proof that the defendant’s sole or dominant motive in publishing the words was improper will establish malice. The fact that the defendant did not believe that what he said was true is usually conclusive evidence of malice to rebut the defence of qualified privilege; and in fair comment it is usually conclusive evidence of malice to show that the defendant did not honestly hold the opinion expressed. If a defendant publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it is true or not, he is treated as if he knew it to be false”.






19.
The appellant relied on the case of Nation Media Group & Another vs Alfred N. Mutua [2017] eKLR, where the court defined the scope of the defence of fair comment thus;
“
To sustain the defence of fair comment, the appellants were required to demonstrate that the words complained of are comment, and not a statement of fact; that there is a basis of fact for the comment, contained or referred to in the article complained of; and that the comment is on a matter of public interest [ see Gately on Libel and Slander, 8th edition, 1981 (Sweet & Maxwell) at paragraph 692 at page 291)”.






20.
During the trial at the lower court, the Appellant’s Officer, in cross-examination, admitted that the Police did not prefer any criminal charges against the 1
st
 Defendant and that none of the recovered items were found in the 1
st
 Respondent’s possession. He also states as follows; ‘The Claimant was only taken to Kasarani Police station. He was not charged in court. Some items were recovered, they were not in the claimant’s possession.’






21.
The publication in question also depicted the 1
st
 Respondent as a thief and was not meant to be an opinion. The message read as follows;-
“
Thieves!!!... Below former RSO deployed at Carrefour TRM have been suspended without pay for being involved in theft, collusion to steal and shoplifting. Hipora doesn’t tolerate such criminal acts by its staff and therefore any officer found involved in theft shall be dealt with. They were handed over to the police for legal action:-


1.
Shadrack Obodo Aloo- HSS 0117






2.
Paul Kipngeno Sang- HSS 0588






3.
Josiah Obiko Omobogo- HSS 0724






4.
Patrick Oduor Odor- HSS 0724






5.
Damiano Ngunia Gachimu- HSS 0412.”








22.
I rely on Gatley on Libel and Slander 6th Edition Page 706 where the learned authors stated that:-
“
If the words complained of contain allegations of facts, the defendant must prove such allegations of facts to be true. It is not sufficient to plead that he bona fide believed them to be true. The defense of fair comment does not extend to cover misstatement of facts, however bona fide. Bona fide belief in the truth of what is written may mitigate the amount, but it cannot disentitle the plaintiff to damages.”






23.
The court associates itself with the decision of the High Court in HCCC No. 1709 of 1996 J.P Machira vs Wangethi Mwangi & Another, where it was held inter alia that:-
“
Any evidence which shows that the defendant knows the statement was false or did not care whether it be true or false will be evidence i.e. of malice. In the instant case, the plaintiff had supplied the defendant with the true position of the matter before the publication was made. Inevitably therefore, at the time of publication, the defendant knew or is taken to have known that the relationship between the plaintiff and Ms Grace Wahu Njoroge was not an advocate/client relationship and that there was no relationship of such a nature between them.
Further, considering also the post publication conduct of the defendant, the correction was made more than a week after the publication, which was made with the knowledge that it was false. I have no hesitation in finding the publication being malicious.”






24.
In the circumstances, I find that the defence of fair comment did not apply as the publication was not expressed as an opinion of the Appellants but as proven facts. I find that the language used by the defendants in the publication is a clear manifestation of malice on their part against the 1
st
 Respondent, and therefore, the defences raised are not available to them.






25.
Lastly, the Appellant argued that the Learned Magistrate erred in law by awarding the 1
st
 Respondent General Damages of Kshs.250,000/=, Exemplary Damages of Kshs.200,000/= plus the costs of the suit and interest. On the other hand, the 1
st
 Respondent argued that the trial court awarded just damages against the Appellant and the 2
nd
 Respondent, and as such, there is no reason for this Honorable Court to interfere with the awards.






26.
In deciding whether to disturb the quantum given by the Lower Court, the Court should be aware of its limits. As an exercise of discretion, it should be done judiciously and conclusively in the circumstances to ensure that the award is not too high or too low to be an erroneous estimate of damages.






27.
The Court of Appeal pronounced itself succinctly on these principles in Kemfro Africa Limited t/a “Meru Express Services (1976)” & Another vs Lubia & Another (No 2) [1985] eKLR as follows:-
“
The principles to be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the quantum of damages awarded by a trial Judge were held by the former Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa to be that it must be satisfied that either that the Judge, in assessing the damages, took into account an irrelevant factor, or left out of account a relevant one, or that, short of this, the amount is so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. See Ilanga v Manyoka, [1961] EA 705, 709, 713 (CA-T); Lukenya Ranching and Farming Co-operative Society Ltd v Kavoloto, [1979] EA 414, 418, 419 (CA-K). This Court follows the same principles.”






28.
I adopt the reasoning of the Court in Joseph Njogu Kamunge vs Charles Muriuki Gachari [2016] eKLR where the court held that;
“
Award of damages is an exercise of discretion of the trial court but the same should be within limits set out in decided case law and must not be inordinately so low or so high as to reflect an erroneous figure. In Butt v Khan Law, JA stated­:-
“... An appellate court will not disturb an award of damages unless it is so inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate. It must be shown that the Judge proceeded on wrong principles, or that he misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low...”






29.
Similarly, in the English Court of Appeal decision in the case of John v MG Ltd the Court held:-
“
The successful plaintiff in a defamation action is entitled to recover, the general compensatory damages such sum as will compensate him for the wrong he has suffered. That must compensate him for damages to his reputation, vindicate his name, and taken account of the distress, hurt and humiliation which the defamatory publication caused........
Exemplary damages on the other hand had gone beyond compensation and are meant to “punish” the defendant. Aggravated damages will be ordered against a defendant who acts out of improper motive e.g. where it is attracted by malice; insistence on a flurry defence of justification or failure to apologize.”






30.
I find nothing in the Judgment of the lower court to suggest or even in the arguments advanced by the Appellant’s Counsel to suggest that the Learned Magistrate erred in its findings, nor has it been demonstrated that the award is inordinately high as to be an erroneous estimate. The upshot is that I hereby dismiss this appeal with costs to the 1
st
 Respondent.






31.
Orders accordingly.

          (Being an appeal from the conviction and sentence arising in Mukurwe-ini Law Courts Sexual Offences case number E009 of 2022 delivered on 09th March, 2023 by Hon. D.K Matutu, S.P.M)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant, WMW, was charged and convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. The particulars of the charge were that on the 17
th
 August, 2022 at around 1800hours at [Particulars Withheld], Nyeri County, the appellant unlawfully and intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of E.W.M, a child aged 17 years, who is mentally handicapped. The appellant faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The particulars of the alternative charge were that on the 17
th
 August, 2022 at around 1800hours at [Particulars Withheld], Nyeri County, the appellant unlawfully and intentionally touched the vagina of E.W.M, a child aged 17 years, who is mentally handicapped, with his penis. The Appellant pleaded not guilty, and the case proceeded to full trial, with the prosecution calling six witnesses. The Appellant testified in his defence and did not call any witnesses.






2.
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial magistrate found the appellant guilty. He was convicted on the main charge and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence, he appealed to this court vide a petition of appeal filed on 29
th
 March, 2023 in which he raised four grounds of appeal as follows;
i.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact to convict him while relying on contradicting prosecution evidence.
ii.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both matters of law and fact to convict him without considering that the prosecution evidence was full of inconsistencies and hence unworthy to warrant any conviction.
iii.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both matter of law and fact to disregard his defense statement without cogent reason, bearing in mind that the same was not challenged by the prosecution evidence.
iv.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact to impose maximum sentence without considering that being a first offender, he was and still is constitutionally guaranteed for the benefit of the least sentence or punishment under the charge.






3.
The parties relied entirely on their written submissions at the appeal hearing. The appellant did not adduce any additional grounds at the appeal hearing as indicated in the petition. He submitted that the prosecution’s evidence lacked credibility, was inconsistent, contradictory, and could not sustain a conviction. He also submitted that the subsequent sentence was inappropriate and excessive. The respondent submitted that the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt, that the conviction was safe, and the sentence was appropriate.






4.
PW1 was the complainant; she testified that on 17th August 2022, she was on her way home from the farm with her grandmother. She testified that she met the appellant along the way, who followed her and pulled her behind an abandoned house, where he held her breast and buttocks, kissed and hugged her. She stated that the appellant removed her trousers and lowered her panty and lowered his shorts, and inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. According to the complainant, the appellant warned her not to inform her grandmother, stating that he would beat her if she did. She stated that the appellant wore a white t-shirt and told her to meet him on Sunday at Baptist Church. The complainant further informed the court that on 21st August, 2022 she saw the appellant in church and told PW3, leading to the appellant's arrest and escort to the police.






5.
PW2 was the complainant's grandmother. She testified that on the material day, along with PW1, they were headed home from the farm at around 5:00 p.m. when the appellant passed them along the way. Since she wanted to pass by the shop, she asked PW1 to head home. According to PW2, when she got home, she found that PW1 hadn’t arrived and met her at the gate crying. Upon prompting, PW2 disclosed that she had been defiled at Kahehia’s home behind the house. She testified that they made a report at the police station and took the complainant to the hospital, where she was examined. PW2 told the court that on 21
st
 August 2022, the appellant was arrested after the complainant saw him in church and informed PW3.






6.
PW3 testified that on 17
th
 August 2022 at around 8.00 p.m., PW2 and one RM went to her home and informed her that PW1 had been defiled while on her way home. She stated that she accompanied them and took PW1 to the hospital. They were directed to the police, and the police then escorted them back to the hospital. PW3 testified that on 21
st
 August, 2022 she attended church in the company of her husband and PW1 and at around noon, PW1 notified her that she had seen the boy who defiled her. She stated that PW1 identified the appellant outside the church as the person who defiled her, leading to his arrest with the assistance of motorcyclists.






7.
PW4 was a clinical officer at (particulars withheld) hospital. His evidence was that on 17
th
 August, 2022, he examined the complainant, who was in the company of her grandmother and escorted by the police. He stated that on medical examination, there was no injury on her genitalia, and the hymen was broken, though not freshly broken. He said further that pus cells were seen, indicating an infection, but no spermatozoa were seen. He produced the P3 form (Pexh4), treatment notes (Pexh5), and lab results (Pexh6). PW5 was a Psychiatrist at (particulars withheld) hospital; she testified that she examined PW1 and concluded that she suffers from intellectual disability. She produced a report dated 30
th
 August 2022 (Pexh7).






8.
PW6 was the investigating officer. She testified that she escorted PW1 to the hospital in the company of her grandmother, where she was examined following the defilement report. She told the court that she visited the scene, which was at an unoccupied house, and that on 21st August 2022, the appellant was escorted to the police station by PW3 in the company of PW1, where he was re-arrested, and witness statements were recorded.






9.
Upon being placed on his defence, the appellant denied committing the offence and stated that on the 20th August 2022, at around 1.00 p.m., he was at the stage when three motorcyclists accosted him, bundled him into a car boot, and took him to the police station where he was informed that he was arrested for defiling a girl.






10.
This is a first appeal to the High Court. I have examined the record, re-evaluated the facts, and drawn independent conclusions per the principles enunciated in the authorities of Njoroge v Republic [1987] KLR 19, Okeno v Republic [1972] E. A. 32, and Felix Kanda v Republic, Eldoret, High Court Criminal Appeal 177 of 2011 [2013] eKLR.






11.
I have considered and analyzed the evidence tendered in the trial court by the prosecution and the appellant, the grounds of appeal, and the written submissions by the parties herein. The issues for determination are two pronged;
i.
Whether the prosecution proved their case to the required threshold;
ii.
Whether the sentence was appropriate.






12.
The Appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. To prove the offence charged, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of defilement as was stated in the case of George Opondo Olunga v Republic [2016] eKLR that the ingredients of an offence of defilement are:
i.
Age of the victim
ii.
Penetration
iii.
Positive identification of the perpetrator






13.
Regarding age, PW1 told the Court that she was 17 years old; the birth certificate (exhibit 2) indicates that she was born on 27
th
 April, 2005. The incident complained of is stated to have occurred on 17
th
 August, 2022. I am thus satisfied that the complainant was 17 years and 4 months old as of the date material to this case. This falls within the confines of the law with which the appellant is charged.






14.
The date of the incident and the complainant's whereabouts are corroborated by the testimony of PW2, who confirmed that they were proceeding home from the farm on that date. PW2 testified that she had instructed the complainant to go home. She met her at the gate crying when she went back to check on her after she arrived ahead of her. The complainant reported to PW2 that she had been sexually assaulted. The complainant was elaborate as to what transpired when she was proceeding home; the assailant followed her, held her hand, and took her behind the abandoned house, where he hugged her, caressed her breasts, and removed her trousers and underwear. The complainant described that the assailant then removed his shorts and inserted his penis into her vagina from behind while holding her buttocks, and she felt pain. She also used the Swahili words ‘tabia mbaya,’ which is a euphemism term used to describe sexual intercourse.






15.
Penetration is defined in Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 as: -
“
the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person.”






16.
The sexual assault history is what was reported on the same date, including at the medical examination. The clinical officer explained that not all sexual encounters result in the presence of spermatozoa. With the evidence on record, I am persuaded that the complainant understood what had transpired, and her description amounted to penetration of her vagina by the assailant using his penis.






17.
On the assailant's identity, the incident happened during daylight; the complainant stated that the appellant engaged her in a conversation, and she could identify him. She described what he was wearing, which was corroborated by PW2. PW2 told the court that she saw the appellant, who was known to her earlier that day, as they proceeded home, and he was wearing the white shirt as described by the complainant. The appellant was arrested near the church, and the complainant testified that the appellant had told her he would meet her there on Sunday. From the evidence of PW3, there is certainty that the complainant referred to the appellant when she stated that she had seen the person who defiled her. From that evidence, I entertain no doubt that the complainant positively identified the appellant. This was evidence of recognition, far more reliable than simple identification.






18.
The evidence on record shows that the complainant was mentally challenged. A disability assessment was conducted, and a report dated 30th August 2022 was produced. Her school assessment report cards were also produced, and the court noted that she can communicate well, interact well with others, and be well-adjusted to the environment. The trial court made a finding from his assessment during the trial that he disagreed with the assessment that she could not follow the court proceedings. The trial court referred to and relied on the school reports from the special school the complainant attended. The trial court, in the judgment, made the finding below;
“
..I do find the alleged victim was telling the truth. I have no reason to doubt them. I am satisfied the victim was telling the truth that she was defiled. That it was the accused who defiled her.”






19.
From the proceedings, the complainant testified with clarity during the examination in chief and cross-examination of the complainant. I find no reason to depart from the findings of the trial court as to her competency and credibility. PW1 came across as a truthful witness.






20.
The appellant submitted that the trial court did not consider his defence. That is not true. The learned trial magistrate analyzed the defence in paragraph 9 of the typed judgment. However, the learned magistrate concluded that the evidence produced by the prosecution was watertight, remained unshaken by the defence and that the alibi tendered was not plausible. I concur fully with those findings.






21.
The ingredients of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1), as read with Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, were proved to the required standard beyond reasonable doubt, and the conviction was safe.






22.
On the sentence, Section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, which is as stipulated hereunder:-
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of sixteen and eighteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than fifteen years.”






23.
The role of this court in an appeal is not to interfere with the discretion of the trial court on the sole ground that the sentence meted out is severe unless it was manifestly excessive. The Court of Appeal of East Africa stated in Wanjema v Republic [1971] EA 494 that:-
“
An appellate court should not interfere with the discretion which a trial court extended as to sentence unless it is evident that it overlooked some material factors, took into account some immaterial factors, acted on the wrong principle, or the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.’’






24.
The Supreme Court has given guidance on minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 in Republic V Joshua Gichuki Mwangi Petition Kiambu Cr. Appeal E022 Of 2023 Judgment 15 No. E018 of 2023. The Supreme Court held that where a sentence is set in statute, the legislature has already determined the course unless declared unconstitutional.






25.
The trial court considered the appellant’s mitigation and the pre-sentence report dated 15
th
 February, 2023 while meting the sentence of 15 years imprisonment. I find no basis for interfering with the trial court’s decision on sentence. However, I note that the learned trial magistrate did not consider the period the appellant had been in custody during sentencing. In accordance with Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the period spent in remand custody from the date of his arrest on 21
st
 August, 2022 shall be deducted from the sentence.






26.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted with the sentence outlined in paragraph 28 of this judgment.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
Before this Court is the application dated 22
nd
 March 2024. The Applicants, TMM and TNM, are seeking to be authorized to adopt Baby RZ aka DS aka GM, hereinafter referred to as the child. Upon adoption, the child is to be known as TMM. TMM and TNM will be appointed as the child’s legal guardians upon the granting of the adoption orders.






2.
The Applicants are a married couple and Kenyan citizens, as evidenced by copies of their Kenyan National Identity Cards and Certificate of Marriage. TMM and TNM are employed; their bank statements and payslips evidence their financial capability and ability to provide for the child. Their health status is good, as evidenced by their medical reports dated 11
th
 May, 2023, and they do not have any previous criminal records, as evidenced by their certificates of Good Conduct issued by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. They have indicated their desire to adopt the child by their being married without being blessed with children, and they have already adopted one child, baby TMM. The applicants desire to help needy children and to grow their family.






3.
The report from the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection State Department for Social Protection and Senior Citizen Affairs – Directorate of Children’s Services (Nairobi County) dated 24
th
 April 2024 indicates that the child is male and 1 year old. He is Kenyan, whose biological mother abandoned him after birth and was born at Athi River Level IV Hospital in Kenya. The child was declared free for adoption on 4
th
 December, 2023 by Buckner Kenya Adoption Services (BKAS) vide freeing Certificate Serial Number 0720.






4.
There is a consistent message that there is the urge for TMM and TNM to have children of their own and their motivation to provide for an abandoned child.






5.
The child is a Kenyan citizen by Article 14 (1), which provides that a person is a citizen by birth if on the day of the person’s birth, whether or not the person is born in Kenya, either the mother or father of the person is a citizen.






6.
In light of the best interests of the child principle provided for under Article 53 (2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010. Sections 8 (1), (2) and (3) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022

Judgment










1.
Vide a Plaint dated 6
th
 July 2021, and filed in Court on 19
th
 July 2021, the Plaintiff herein Peter Gichuhi Wainaina, moved the court for Judgement against the Defendants herein jointly and severally for: -
a.
A declaration be made that the former Plot No. 26B, and later changed to title Number LR Mitubiri/Wempa/Block 2/2670, validly belonged to the Plaintiff.
b.
A declaration that the subsequent registration and title deed issued in respect to title No. LR Mitubiri/ Wempa/Block 2/ 2670, by the 2nd Defendant to the 1
st
 Defendant, her agents, servant was illegally done, and the same should be declared null and void and cancelled.
c.
General Damages.
d.
Costs of this suit and interest at Court rate.
e.
Any other or further relief that this Honourable Court may deem fit and just to grant.






2.
It is the Plaintiff’s claim that at all material time, he has been a registered member of the 2
nd
 Defendant Society, vide his Share Certificate No. 2616., and that the 2
nd
 Defendant has at all material time been the registered proprietor of all that parcel of land known as LR NO. 10726/1, Thika, on behalf of its members.






3.
He also claimed that in the year 1988, he successful balloted for subdivision and distribution of the suit land, and was allotted Plot No.26B. That thereafter, he paid all the requisite charges for survey and registration, and immediately took possession and occupation of the suit land, wherein he cultivated thereon.






4.
He also alleged that on or about the month of March 2010, he discovered that his name had been illegally removed from the 2
nd
 Defendant’s Register, and his plot transferred to the 1
st
 Defendant. That as a result of the discovery, he filed a suit at the Co-operative Tribunal, in Nairobi, being Cause No. 452 of 2011, wherein he had sued the 2
nd
 Defendant to give him back the suit plot, vide his share certificate no 2616, being plot no 26B.






5.
He claimed that while the matter was pending there, it came to his realization that a new title deed for his Plot No. 26B, had been issued to the 1
st
 Defendant as LR Mitubiri/ Wempa/ Block 2/2670. Therefore, it was his contention that the 2
nd
 Defendant’s act of transferring his parcel of land to the 1
st
 defendant was illegal, unlawful and devoid of the set procedure.






6.
The Plaintiff claim is for a declaration that the said transfer was illegally done, as the 1
st
 Defendant was not even a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant and therefore, the said registration was fraudulently done.






7.
In support of his Claim, the Plaintiff filed a Witness Statement wherein he reiterated his averments save to add that he had previously filed a suit at Makuyu Land Disputes Tribunal, being Case No.43 of 2010, but which judgment was quashed. Additionally, he averred that he filed a case at the Cooperative Tribunal case no 452 of 2011, and that the Cooperative Tribunal determined the matter in his favour to the extent that he was a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant. Further, that he is not in occupation of the suit land, as the 1
st
 Defendant is utilizing the same. He urged the court to allow his claim.






8.
Initially, the matter proceeded exparte, after the Plaintiff had served the 1
st
 Defendant vide substituted service, on allegation that he could not reach her. After the hearing of the matter, the court entered judgement in favour of the Plaintiff on  28
th
 July 2022.






9.
However, vide a Notice of Motion Application dated  30
th
 November 2022, the 1
st
 Defendant sought to have the said exparte Judgement set aside, varied and or reviewed. After an inter- parties hearing of the said Application, this court vide its Ruling of  13
th
 July 2023, allowed the said Application, wherein the exparte Judgement was set aside and the 1
st
 Defendant was allowed to file her Defence.






10.
Subsequently, the 1
st
 Defendant filed her Statement of Defence dated 26
th
 July 2023, and denied all the allegations made in the Plaint. She averred that she is the registered owner of the suit land Mitubiri/ Wempa/2/2670, having purchased the same from one Josphat Kibe Nyoike, who had purchased the same from the original owner and holder of ballot no 26B, one Joseph Mwangi Kamau.






11.
Consequently, the 1
st
 Defendant prayed for the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s suit with costs.






12.
After, the filing of the Defence, the Plaintiff filed a Reply to the 1
st
 Defendant Defence dated 31
st
 August 2022, and joined issues with the 1
st
 Defendant statement of Defence and reiterated the contents of his Plaint. He urged the court to dismiss the 1
st
 Defendant’s Defence with costs and enter judgement in his favour as prayed in his Plaint.






13.
Further, after the Pre-trial directions, the matter proceeded for inter- parties hearing, wherein the Plaintiff gave evidence for himself and called no witness. On her part, the 1
st
 Defendant who is a national of Britain also gave her Defence online, and called no witness.






Plaintiff’s Case.


14.
PW1; Peter Gichuhi Wainaina, from Makuyu area and a peasant farmer adopted his witness statement dated. He also produced the list of documents as his P. EXHIBITS 1 to 2. In his evidence, he alleged that the 1
st
 Defendant grabbed his parcel of land, and due to that, he sued both defendants herein.






15.
In his witness Statement, the Plaintiff reiterated the contends of his Claim and added that though the Co-operative Tribunal had found that he was a legal member of the 2
nd
 Defendant, and owner of the suit land, it could not cancel the title of the suit land due to lack of requisite jurisdiction to do so and thus this suit.






16.
He further stated that the title deed issued to the 1
st
 Defendant was illegally issued and he thus asked this court to cancel the same and that the said title deed should be registered in his name.






17.
Upon cross exam by counsel for the 1
st
 Defendant, he confirmed that he obtained the suit plot in 1988, as that is when he balloted for it. That he took possession immediately and he has been on the plot since then.






18.
However, he confirmed that in 2010, his parcel of land was given to the 1
st
 Defendant and that is when he filed the case before the Co-operative Tribunal. That according to the Register at the Society, the plot belongs to him, and the Liquidator had confirmed that position, being Mitubiri/ Wempa/ Block2/ 2670.






19.
Further, after being shown the Register, as per the Liquidator’s Report, it showed that the land belonged to Jane, the 1
st
 Defendant, which position he did not agree with.






20.
Further, he confirmed that the Cooperative Tribunal found that he was a member of the Society, but not that he was the owner of the suit plot. He also confirmed that he had filed a claim at the District Lands Disputes Tribunal, at Makuyu wherein the DO, held that the land belongs to him.






21.
He claimed that the District Land Disputes award was quashed, and they were referred to the Cooperative Tribunal, and since the land had a title deed, the Cooperative tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction to cancel the said title deed.






22.
It was her claim that the title in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant was issued illegally, and was issued with the title deed, while the case at the Cooperative tribunal was on going. It was his claim that he owns the suit land and he utilises it, but the 1
st
 Defendant has invaded the same, and had refused to vacate from the suit land.






23.
On re-exam, the Plaintiff averred that he discovered the grabbing by the 1
st
 Defendant in 2010, and he filed the Cooperative tribunal’s case in 2011, wherein, he claimed back his land. He further reiterated that the title in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant was issued in December 2011, while the tribunal case was on going.






24.
It was his allegations that at the Tribunal, they were not asked to show how they had obtained the ballot papers. However, the Liquidator Report, in para 3 had confirmed that he was the owner of the suit land, and the tribunal too found that the land belonged to him. That he was referred to this court, as the land had a title deed, and the tribunal could not cancel it, for lack of requisite jurisdiction to do so.








1
St
 Defendant’s Case


25.
Jane Waithera Kiguru, a resident of Britain denied the Plaintiff’s claim, and adopted her Witness Statement dated 26
th
 July 2023, as her evidence in chief. She also produced her bundle of documents as D. Exhibit1.






26.
In her Witness Statement, the 1
st
 Defendant alleged that he is the lawful registered proprietor of the suit land being Mitubiri/ Wempa Block 2/ 2670, which she purchased in the year 2010 from one Josphat Kibe Nyoike(deceased), who was a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant.






27.
She claimed that she bought the suit land through her father, Richard Kiguru (now deceased), whom she had given  Power of Attorney, to purchase the suit land on her behalf.






28.
She further claimed that upon completion of the said purchase, she was issued with all the relevant documents, relating to the suit land, which documents included the Ballot, Share Certificate and Receipts. That the said transfer of the suit land was effected to her at the 2
nd
 Defendant’s office, wherein the Chairman, Secretary, and the treasurer signed the transfer forms, and effected the same, which transaction was being carried out by her father on her behalf, and was registered as the owner of the suit land.






29.
She further claimed that the title deed was processed by the 2
nd
 Defendant, and she obtained the title of the said land, being plot No. 26B, in her name, and the title deed was issued on 8
th
 December 2011, and she has been in possession since 2010, carrying on farming activities.






30.
Further, she claimed that she became aware of this suit in Se
ptember of 2022
, when she came over for the funeral of her father in law, and on 12
th
 September 2022, she visited the suit property being the registered owner of the suit property, and the neighbour informed her of a claim by another person as the owner of the suit land.






31.
That after receiving that claim, she carried a search and found that the suit land was still in her name, but an injunctive order was placed thereon, pending the finalization of this suit.






32.
Thereafter, she engaged the services of an advocate, who filed an application for setting aside the exparte judgement. She denied the suit herein and insisted that she is the legal registered owner of the suit land herein, and that the Plaintiff has no right to the suit land. She urged the court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s case with costs.






33.
On being cross examined by the counsel for the Plaintiff, she testified that she relocated to United Kingdom in 1994. She also claimed that she was a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant, and she purchased the suit land in 2010 from Josphat Kibe, when it was still plot no 26B.  She alleged that the said Josphat Kibe was a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant.






34.
However, she did not have particulars of Josphat Kibe’s membership, as she purchased the suit land through her father, whom she had given the Power of Attorney. Further, she confirmed the power of Attorney was not among the documents produced by her as exhibits.






35.
It was her evidence that she bought the suit land through her father, Richard Kiguru Gichuki, though she could not produce the Power of Attorney, nor the sale agreement, between herself and the vendor, Josphat Kibe Nyoike.  She however testified that she had receipts for payment, and that everything was done through the 2
nd
 Defendant.






36.
She also identified the transfer from Josphat Kibe to herself, dated  26
th
 February 2010, though she was not in Kenya then, but signed the form through her father, who had been given Power of Attorney. She also confirmed that the original owner of the suit land was Joseph Mwangi Kamau, and there was evidence of the transfer from him to  Josphat Kibe Nyoike  dated  4
th
 January 1996.






37.
It was her evidence that from the transfer document, it is evident that the suit land was transferred from Joseph Mwangi Kamau to Josphat Kibe Nyoike, and then herself, and the same is done by crossing the names of Joseph and later that of Josphat, and insertion of her name.






38.
Further, she claimed that she had a Share Certificate dated 19
th
 June 1980, which has been crossed twice. She confirmed the documents by the Plaintiff were issued in 1980, and the share certificate is no 2616, and the one held by herself is no 3790, and thus the Plaintiff’s certificate was first in time.






39.
Further, she confirmed that though she has documents for the ownership of plot no 26B, just like the Plaintiff, the shades of those documents are different. She further claimed that she did not know about the Presidential Commission that was given mandate to verify every Plot.






40.
She also confirmed to having seen the two receipts, one dated 31
st
 May 1988, and the other 23
rd
 December 1988, and that she did not have statements from the original owners, though she had the receipts with her. She also confirmed that those receipts have been cancelled and re cancelled. However, the Plaintiff’s receipts were not cancelled at all.






41.
On the Judgement of the Cooperative tribunal, she confirmed that the Plaintiff was declared to be the original owner of the suit land, and she was not aware of any appeal. It was her evidence that her late father is the one who received the copy of the title deed.






42.
In re-exam, she testified that the land transaction could not go on without the Power of Attorney.






43.
After close of viva vove evidence, parties were directed to file and exchange written submissions, which directions they duly complied with. The Plaintiff through the Law Firm of Kibathi Chege & Co Advocates filed their written submissions dated 22
nd
 January 2024.  On her part, the 1
st
 Defendant filed her written submissions dated 29
th
 January 2024, through the Law Firm of Wambui Muiruri & Co Advocates, and urged the court to dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim.






44.
In his submissions, the Plaintiff reproduced the submissions relied on to support the hearing that had proceeded exparte. He summarised the evidence adduced by himself and the 1
st
 Defendant in court, and averred that the 1
st
 defendant did not avail sufficient evidence to support her allegation that she was legally registered as the owner of the suit land.






45.
It was the Plaintiff’s submissions that the he discharged his burden of proof on the required standard of balance of probabilities, and thus the court should allow his claim.






46.
Reliance was placed on the cases of Shaneebal Limited vs County Government of Machakos [2018], which cited the case of Karuru Munyororo vs Joseph Ndumia Murage &; Another, Nyeri HCC No.95 of 1988, wherein the Court held that the Plaintiff therein had discharged her burden of proof, and there being no Defendant to cross examine her, the Plaintiff’s evidence was uncontroverted.






47.
It was his further submissions that he had discharged his burden of proof and had demonstrated that he is entitled to the suit property. He invited this Court to the provisions of Section 26(1) of the 
Land Registration Act
, and urged the court to find that the 1
st
 Defendant’s title cannot stand as it was obtained fraudulently.






48.
For this submissions, the Plaintiff relied on the case of Alice Chemutai Too -vs- Nickson Kipkurui Korir & 2 Others (2015) eKLR, where the Court opined that a title can be impeached where it is established that the same was obtained fraudulently. The court held as follows:
“
It will be seen from the above that title is protected, but the protection is removed and title can be impeached, if it is procured through fraud or misrepresentation, to which the person is proved to be a party; or where it is procured illegally, unprocedurally, or through a corrupt scheme. I do not see how a person with a perfectly good title should be deprived of his title by activities of fraudsters. It is in fact time to put down our feet and affirm that no fraudster, nor any beneficiary of fraudulent activities, stands to gain for his fraud, and no title holder will ever be deprived of his good title by the tricks of con artists.”






49.
Further, the Plaintiff urged this Court to be guided by the provisions of Section 80(1) of the 
Land Registration Act
, and order for cancellation of the title issued to the 1
st
 Defendant.






50.
The Plaintiff also relied on the case of  Popwa Company ltd vs Justus Nyamu Gatondo & Another ( 2020) eklr,  to support his claim that the 1
st
 Defendant’s title was a candidate for cancelation.






51.
On the other hand, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff failed to prove his case to the set standard of balance pf probabilites and therefore his case should be dismissed with costs.






52.
She highlighted the issues for determination as follows:


1.
Who is the legal owner of the suit property?






2.
Whether title issued in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant was acquired illegally and/or fraudulently, procedurally or through a corrupt scheme and whether it should be cancelled.






3.
Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs sought.






4.
Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to cost and interest of this suit.








53.
On the issue of who is the legal ownership of the suit property, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted that she is indeed the registered owner of the suit property herein, as is evident from the copy of the title deed, that she had produced as exhibit, which title deed is in her name, as proof of ownership.






54.
To buttress this submission, the 1
st
 Defendant relied on the provisions of Section 24(a) of the 
Land Registration Act
, that provides as follows:
“
Subject to this Act, the registration of a person as the proprietor of land shall vest in that person the absolute ownership of that land together with all rights and privileges belonging or appurtenant thereto.”






55.
Further, the 1
st
 Defendant relied on Section 25(1) of the said Act, provides that for such a registered owner, his/her rights are indefeasible and are held free from all other interests and claims and that the rights can only be defeated in the manner provided for under the Act.






56.
It was the 1
st
 Defendant further submissions that the register produced by both the Plaintiff and herself indicated that the 1
st
 Defendant was the owner of plot no 28B. Further, the Status Report on MITUBIRI/WEMPA BLOCK 2/2670, by the Liquidators confirmed that under the register of members of the 2
nd
 Defendant, Jane Waithira Kiguru appears as the owner of the suit land. Likewise, the report indicated that the title deed was handed over to her before the Liquidators took office.






57.
To buttress this submissions, the 1
st
 Defendant relied on the following cases: Willy Kipsongok Morogo v. Albert K. Morogo (2017) eKLR;  where the court held; ‘’ the evidence on record shows that the suit land is registered in the names of the Plaintiff, and therefore, is entitled to the protection under section 24, 25 and 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
’’; and the case of  Joseph N.K. Arap Ng’ok V Moijo Ole Keiwua &amp; 4 Others [1997]eKLR, where the court held;-
“
Once one is registered as an owner of land, he has absolute and indefeasible title which can only be challenged on grounds of fraud or misrepresentation and such is the sanctity of the title bestowed upon the title holder.”






58.
Further, the 1
st
 Defendant relied in Civil Appeal No. 246 of 2013: Arthi Highway Developers Limited Vs. West End Butchery Limited and Others, where the Court of Appeal held:
“
Section 23(1) of the then Registration of Titles Act (now reproduced substantially as Sections 25 and 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
, set out below) gives an absolute and indefeasible title to the owner of the property. The title of such an owner can only be subject to challenge on grounds of fraud or misrepresentation, to which the owner is proved to be a party. Such is the sanctity of title bestowed upon the title holder under the Act. It is our law and law take precedence over all other alleged equitable rights of title. In fact, the Act is meant to give such sanctity of title, otherwise the whole process of registration of Titles and the entire system in relation to ownership of property in Kenya would be placed in jeopardy.”






59.
To sum up, the 1
st
 Defendant invited the court to consider the evidence adduced and hold that she is indeed the absolute proprietor of the suit land; L.R NO. Mitubiri/wempa BLK 2/2670, and hence entitled to protection of the law in accordance with the provisions of Sections 24, 25 and 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
.






60.
On the issue of whether the title issued in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant was acquired illegally and/or fraudulently, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme, reference was made to Section 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
,2012 provides;
(1)
The certificate of title issued by the Registrar upon registration, or to a purchaser of land upon a transfer or transmission by the proprietor shall be taken by all courts as prima facie evidence that the person named as proprietor of the land is the absolute and indefeasible owner, subject to the encumbrances, easements, restrictions and conditions contained or endorsed in the certificate, and the title of that proprietor shall not be subject to challenge, except-
(a)
On the ground of fraud or misrepresentation to which the person is proved to be a party; or
(b)
where the certificate of title has been acquired illegally, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme.






61.
Reliance was placed on Order 2 rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides as follows:
“
A party shall in any pleadings subsequent to the plaint plead specifically any matter, for example performance, relief payment, fraud, inevitable accident act of God, any relevant statute of limitation or any fact showing illegality.”






62.
In light of the above provisions, the 1
st
 defendant submitted that the Plaintiff did not comply with the above provisions of the law. That the Plaintiff in his testimony and submissions had alleged that the suit land was acquired fraudulently. However, the Plaintiff did not plead fraud in his claim, nor did he produce any evidence to prove that there was fraud nor did he plead fraud on the part of the 1
st
 Defendant.






63.
The 1
st
 Defendant also relied on the case of Africanus Osakaise Eprong & another v John Oroni Ikapasa [2022] eKLR, where the court stated as follows;
“
It is well settled in law that fraud is a serious accusation which procedurally has to be pleaded and proved to the standard above a balance of probabilities but not beyond reasonable doubt.’
This was buttressed in the case of Vijay Morjaria vs Nansingh Madhusingh Darbar & Another [2000] eKLR, where Tunoi, JA held:
“
The acts alleged to be fraudulent must, of course, be set out, and then it should be stated that these acts were done fraudulently. It is also settled law that fraudulent conduct must be distinctly alleged and distinctly proved, and it is not allowable to leave fraud to be inferred from the facts.”






64.
Further, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted that the law under Sections 107 & 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 Cap 80 LOK, dictates that whoever alleges must prove. It was her submissions that the Plaintiff herein merely alleged that there was fraud, but has not provided any evidence. That no such evidence or documents were produced before the Court to enable it deduce fraud, and/or forgery. Further, that the Plaintiff failed to prove the documents that the 1
st
 Defendant produced were not genuine, or were acquired fraudulently, illegally, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme.






65.
It was her further submissions that the Plaintiff failed to prove that the 1
st
 Defendant being a non-member of 2
nd
 Defendant could not buy plots from the 2
nd
 Defendant. That no by-laws to that effect were produced, and that the Plaintiff did not prove that the person from whom the 1
st
 Defendant bought the suit land from, was not a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant. It was also submitted that the Plaintiff did not call any other witnesses to support his case.






66.
The 1
st
 Defendant relied on the case of Kimanthi Kilonzo v Susan Wangari Kiiru & another [2019] eKLR Justice Kimei stated as follows;
“
Fraud must be pleaded and proved to the required standard by anyone who alleges fraud in a case. The former Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa in R.G. Patel versus Lalji Makanji (1957) EA 314 stated as follows:
“Allegations of fraud must be strictly proved, although the standard of proof may not be so heavy as to require proof beyond reasonable doubt, something more than a mere balance of probabilities is required.”






67.
Further, it was submitted that the Plaintiff has failed to discharge the standard of proof that is required for the alleged fraud against the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Defendants, to that extent the Plaintiff’s claim is bound to fail and it must fail. Since the Plaintiff did not produce any evidence to warrant impeachment of the title deed of the1
st
 Defendant, it was submitted that the said title remains unchallenged.






68.
The court was invited to find and hold that in absence of any proof that the title was acquired fraudulently, the 1
st
 Defendant is the lawful proprietor of land parcel L.R No. Mitubiri/wempa BLK 2/2670.






69.
On the issue of whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs sought, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted that the claim is time barred according to Section 7 of the Statutory of Limitation Act. it was submitted that in 2010 upon realisation realization that the suit land was occupied by the 1
st
 Defendant, Plaintiff did not take any action, but did it 11 years later upon the realisation he has lost his proprietor rights on the suit land.






70.
It was also submitted that upon cross examination of PW1, he had indicated that he tried to sort out the issue of the allocation of the suit land with the 2
nd
 Defendant, and later filed a claim before the District Officer where he stated that the 2
nd
 Defendant refused to allocate him another land. It was her submissions that the Plaintiff was given a chance to be allocated another plot by the 2
nd
 Defendant when they realized that the earlier allocation might have been double allocation. However, the Plaintiff refused, declined and neglected to follow up with the 2
nd
 Defendant for allocation of another land and instead decided to pursue the suit land. This is evidenced from the Status Report on MITUBIRI/WEMPA BLK 2/2670 by the Liquidator.






71.
Citing the report by the Liquidator, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted that it is evident that when the 2
nd
 Defendant’s office burnt down, a formal announcement was made in early year 2010 through Gikuyu vernacular radio stations for members to appear at the Society offices compound on specified date, bringing with them their share certificates, ballot cards and various receipts for purpose of verification of membership and further aid in the reconstruction of the register of members.






72.
It was her submissions that the Plaintiff did not appear and hence, he was not registered in the current register whereas the 1
st
 Defendant took all the receipts, ballot card and share certificate, which were verified and her name put in the register as the owner of Plot no.26B currently MITUBIRI/WEMPA BLK 2/2670.






73.
Further, the 1
st
 Defendant invited then court to make comparison of the Plaintiff’s ballot card, PCMF stamp on the ballot and receipts and those of the 1
st
 Defendant and make an inference. It was submitted that the ballot card of the 1
st
 Defendant bears the names of the first to the current owner, ballot no.26B and registration number 3205. The PCMF stamp bears a date, plot no.26B and folio no.3205 and a signature. The receipt for membership fee dated 30/3/79, and receipt for transfer dated 26/2/2010, and transfer forms bears the registration no. 3205 at the top.






74.
It was her further submissions that the other hand, the Plaintiff’s ballot bears his name, ballot no. 26(b) and a PCMF stamp which has no date, plot number, folio and signature. The receipt for share capital 12/9/1978 bears a registration number 1001 at the top and which does not appear on the ballot nor on the PMCF stamp.






75.
The 1
st
 Defendant also submitted that the Plaintiff failed to discharge its burden of proof on the required standard of balance of probability, against the 1
st
 Defendant and that his claim to impeach the 1
st
 Defendants title was not supported by any documentary evidence, and thus his claim must fail.






76.
On the issue of whether the Plaintiff is entitled to costs, the 1
st
 Defendant relied on Section 27 (1) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 provides as follows:
“
Subject to such conditions and limitations as maybe prescribed and to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, the costs incidental to all suits shall be in discretion of the court or judge shall have full power to determine by whom and out of whom and out of what property and to what extent such costs are to be paid and give all the necessary directions for the purposes aforesaid and the fact that the court has no jurisdiction to try the suit shall be no other to the exercise of those powers; provided that the costs of any action, cause or other matter or issue shall follow the events unless the court or judges shall for good reason.”






77.
In concluding, the 1
st
 Defendant submitted and reiterated that the court should find her as the rightful legal proprietor of the suit land. That the Plaintiff has failed to prove his case against the 1
st
 Defendant, and therefore the suit herein should be dismissed with costs to the 1
st
 Defendant.






78.
The above is the summary of the pleadings by the parties herein, the evidence adduced in court, the rival written submissions, cited authorities, and the relevant provisions of law, which this court has read and carefully considered.






79.
This Court has perused all the above cited issues, and the evidence adduced by the parties and finds the issues of determination are;
i.
Who is the legal owner of the suit property?
ii.
Whether title issued in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant should be cancelled?
iii.
Who should bear costs of the suit?








i).        Who is the rightful or legal owner of the suit property?


80.
The legal owner of a property means the person who owns the legal title of the land, or the owner of the property recognized by law, and who has the ultimate control over the said property. In its simple meaning, the rightful owner means the person having a just or legally established claim, or the legitimate owner. It also refers to a legal claim a person has over a thing, granting him the widest range of property right. It also signifies the title given to an individual with the most significant property rights over a particular property.






81.
Both the Plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendant are each claiming ownership of the suit land, and they desire this court to declare each of them as the rightful or legal owner of the suit land.






82.
However, for this court to determine on who is the rightful owner of the suit land, sufficient evidence has to be availed by the party desiring the court to so determine in his/ her favour, so as to proof the case on the required standard, as provided by sections 107 and 108 of the 
Evidence Act
.






83.
Therefore, in determining the question of who is the rightful owner of the suit land, the court will consider the available evidence, and then conclude on who is the person having a legitimate claim over the ownership of the suit land. It is evident that ownership of land is proved through a certificate of title or a title deed, which serves as proof of ownership, and as provided by section 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
, such certificate of title is primafaciely evidence that the person holding the said certificate of title has absolute and indefeasible ownership.






84.
However, a Certificate of title can also be challenged and impeached, if there is proof that the said title was acquired through fraud, misrepresentation, unprocedurally or through corrupt scheme. See section 26(1) a & b of the 
Land Registration Act
.






85.
There are several decided cases on when and how a title deed can be impeached. See the case of Elijah Makeri Nyangwara –vs-stephen Mungai Njuguna & Another [2013] eKLR, which the Court held as follows:
“
The evidence in this case puts no one in doubt that the title to the 1st defendant was obtained illegally, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme. The documents that conveyed title to him were forged. The title could not therefore have been obtained legally or procedurally. I am satisfied that the provisions of Section 26 (1) (b) have been met and that the title of the 1st defendant is liable to be cancelled. I therefore proceed to cancel the title of the 1st defendant and his registration as proprietor of the suit land. The plaintiff should be registered as owner of the suit land. It is regretful that the 1st defendant was snared by the scheme perpetuated by the 2nd defendant. I sympathize with him but I must ensure that the real title holder is protected and that he is registered as the proper owner of the suit land.”






86.
Once the court establishes, who the rightful owner of the suit property is, then it is evident the rights of such registered owner are protected and are set out in sections 24 and 25 of the 
Land Registration Act
 2012. For the suit property, which is  LR Mitubiri/ Wempa/ Block 2/ 2670,  the same was registered in December 2011, and is governed by the Registered 
Land Act
, Cap 300( repealed) and sections 27 and 28, of the said repealed Act come into play.






87.
Section 27 of Cap 300(repealed) provides that:
“
Subject to this Act -
(a)
the registration of a person as the proprietor of land shall vest in that person the absolute ownership of that land together with all rights and privileges belonging or appurtenant thereto;
(b)
the registration of a person as the proprietor of a lease shall vest in that person the leasehold interest described in the lease, together with all implied and expressed rights and privileges belonging or appurtenant thereto and subject to all implied and expressed agreements, liabilities and incidents of the lease.”
And section 28 provides that;
“
The rights of a proprietor, whether acquired on first registration or whether acquired subsequently for valuable consideration or by an
order of court, shall not be liable to be defeated except as provided in this Act, and shall be held by the proprietor, together with all privileges and appurtenances belonging thereto, free from all other interests and claims whatsoever, but subject -
(a)
to the leases, charges and other encumbrances and to the conditions and restrictions, if any, shown in the register; and
(b)
unless the contrary is expressed in the register, to such liabilities, rights and interests as affect the same and are declared by section 30 not to require noting on the register:
Provided that nothing in this section shall be taken to relieve a proprietor from any duty or obligation to which he is subject as a trustee.”






88.
It is therefore evident from section 28 above, (of the repealed cap 300 LoK) which is now mirrored in section 25 of the 
Land Registration Act
, that a certificate of title can be defeated as provided by the Act. As stated earlier, instances that can lead to defeat of a title are: proof of fraud, misrepresentation and a title acquired through corrupt scheme or unprocedurally.






89.
The Plaintiff has alleged that he acquired the suit property, which was initially Plot No 26B, in 1988, from the 2
nd
 Defendant , through balloting. He alleged that he was a member of the said Society and was eligible to ballot, and produced various documents to support his claim.






90.
On her part, the 1
st
 defendant denied the Plaintiff’s claim, and averred that she is the rightful owner of the suit land, having purchased the same from one Josphat Kibe Nyoike, who had also purchased the same from Joseph Mwangi Kamau, who was an initial member of the 2
nd
 Defendant. She produced various documents to support her claim.






91.
The available evidence is therefore a claim by the Plaintiff, which claim has been denied by the 1
st
 Defendant. The Plaintiff is the one who has alleged and thus the burden of proof is upon him, to call sufficient evidence to proof his case on the required standard.  See the case of Miller v Minister of Pensions [1942] 2 ALL ER 372, the Court held as followsstated;
“
The [standard of proof]… is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of probability… If the evidence is such that the tribunal can say ‘we think it more probable than not’ the burden is discharged, but if the probabilities are equal, it is not.”






92.
It is also evident that the 1
st
 Defendant is in possession of a title deed for  Mitubiri/ Wempa Block 2/ 2670, which is the suit land. The said title deed was issued on 8
th
 December 2011, in the name of  Jane Waithira Kiguru.






93.
The Plaintiff had alleged that he was allocated the suit land as plot No. 26B, in 1988, after balloting, and he took possession of the said land. However, in 2010, he discovered that the 1
st
 Defendant had grabbed his land, and he filed a claim at the District Land Disputes tribunal, which tribunal found in his favour. However, the said award was quashed by the High Court, and matter was referred to the Cooperative tribunal.






94.
From the Judgement of the Cooperative tribunal, it is clear that the claim thereon was filed before it on 2
nd
 October 2011. The title deed was issued on 8
th
 December 2011, in favour of the 1
st
 Defendant during the pendency of the Cooperative tribunal’s claim.






95.
If the Title deed, was issued during the pendency of the Cooperative tribunal case, does the doctrine Lis pendens apply herein? This doctrine of Lis pendens has been defined as the power, jurisdiction or control which a court acquires over property involved in suit pending the continuance of action, and until final judgement therein. Blacks Law Dictionary defines Lis Pendens as, ‘’ Jurisdiction, power or control acquired by a court over property while legal action is pending”






96.
In Civil Appeal No. E042 of 2021; Marete v Ndegwa & 2 others (Civil Appeal E042 of 2021) [2024] KECA 545 (KLR) (24 May 2024) (Judgment), the Court of Appeal dealt extensively with the issue of Lis Pendens and observed as follows;The doctrine is based on equity, good conscience or justice because it rests upon an equitable and just foundation that it will be impossible to bring an action or suit to a successful termination if alienations are permitted to prevail.






97.
Further, the same court proceeded to hold as follows; The ITPA was repealed by the 
Land Registration Act
 Number 3 of 2013 (LRA) whose Section 107(1) provides for the saving and transitional provisions of the Act in the following terms:
Unless the contrary is specifically provided for in this Act, any right, interest, title, power, or obligation acquired, accrued, established, coming into force or exercisable before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be governed by the law applicable to it immediately prior to the commencement of this Act.
A reading of the LRA does not reveal any prohibition of the application of the doctrine of lis pendens. It is for this reason, and in view of section 107 aforesaid, that this Court has held that the doctrine of lis pendens is still applicable to this day, albeit under common law (see Naftali Ruthi Kinyua vs. Patrick Thuita Gachure & Another [2015] eKLR). That doctrine was dealt with extensively by this Court in Co- operative Bank of Kenya Limited vs. Patrick Kangethe Njuguna & 5 others [2017] eKLR in which the Court expressed itself as hereunder:






98.
It was the further findings of the Court of Appeal that;- “ In our understanding, the doctrine of lis pendens runs with the suit, so that its application depends on the outcome of the suit. Where the person relying on the doctrine succeeds in the suit, the doctrine may come to its aid in setting aside a transaction that might have been entered into between the other party to the suit and a third party without necessarily affecting the other party’s liability to the third party. However, where the party who seeks to rely on the doctrine fails in the suit, he can no longer rely on the doctrine.






99.
In the claim before the Cooperative tribunal, the main issue was who actually owned the suit land. Though the Tribunal held that the Plaintiff herein was a member of the Society, it could not proceed and deal with the title as it lacked jurisdiction.






100.
The main contention at the Cooperative tribunal was on the rightful ownership of the suit land. However, during the active prosecution of the Tribunal’s claim, the 1st Defendant proceeded and obtained the title deed in her name. Acquisition of the title deed over the suit land, gave her different rights over the suit land. She acquired the title to the suit land during active prosecution of the Cooperative tribunal case, and that action went against the doctrine of Lis pendens.






101.
Further, it is evident that both the Plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendant are claiming ownership of the suit land. The Plaintiff has documents to show that he balloted for Plot No. 26B, which is the suit property. The 1
st
 Defendant claims ownership of the suit land through purchase, which parcel of land was plot no 26B, before acquisition of title deed in 2011.






102.
There are two competing individuals herein claiming ownership of this parcel of land. Courts in this country have severally held that where the two competing claims over the suit land, then the root of the titles has to be considered and traced. See the case of  Hebert L. Martin & 2 others vs Margaret J. Kamar & 5 others ( 2016) eklr,  where the Court held that:
“
A court when faced with a case of two or more titles over the same land has to make an investigation so that it can be discovered which of the two titles should be upheld. This investigation must start at the root of the title and follow all processes and procedures that brought forth the two titles at hand. It follows that the title that is to be upheld is that which conformed to procedure and can properly trace its root without a break in the chain. The parties to such litigation must always bear in mind that their title is under scrutiny and they need to demonstrate how they got their title starting with its root. No party should take it for granted that simply because they have a title deed or Certificate of Lease, then they have a right over the property. The other party also has a similar document and there is therefore no advantage in hinging one's case solely on the title document that they hold. Every party must show that their title has a good foundation and passed properly to the current title holder. With the nature of case at hand, I will need to embark on investigating the chain of processes that gave rise to the two titles in issue as it is the only way I can determine which of the two titles should be upheld.”






103.
It is evident that proof of ownership of a property is the acquisition and possession of title deed or document. In the instant case, the 1
st
 Defendant is the one who is in possession of a title deed. On the face of it, she is the absolute and indefeasible owner. However, it is clear that she acquired the certificate of title on 8
th
 December 2011, during an active prosecution of the case before the Cooperative Tribunal.






104.
The Plaintiff herein is in possession of documents that he claimed were given to him by the 2
nd
 Defendant after balloting for a plot, which is part of the subdivision of the 2
nd
 Defendant parcel of land, Mitubiri/ Wempa/ Block 2.  The 1
st
 Defendant also has documents that were alleged in possession of the original allottee of the suit land, before she acquired the suit land.






105.
Given that both the Plaintiff and 1
st
 Defendant have documents in their possession to support their claim, this court will trace the root of these documents and their authenticity to determine on who is the rightful owner of the suit land.






106.
In tracing the root of the suit property, this court has considered the documents produced by both the Plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendant. The Plaintiff alleged that the 1
st
 Defendant was not a member of the 2
nd
 Defendant, and therefore could not own land. However, the 1
st
 Defendant defended her ownership of the suit land and averred that he purchased the suit land from a person who had purchased the plot from the original owner. There is no evidence adduced by the Plaintiff that non- members of the 2
nd
 Defendant could not own land, especially after purchasing the said land from original members.






107.
This court has considered the Plaintiff’s documents, and has noted that the Plaintiff has receipts No 55, 56 and 57, which show that he paid the entrance fee, Share capital, and Survey fees on 12
th
 September 1978. He thereafter obtained the Share Certificate for Methi& Swani Farmers’ Co-operative Society Ltd on 30
th
 October 1980, being Certificate No.  2616.






108.
The Plaintiff also produced other receipts especially the one dated 23
rd
 December 1988, issued by the Presidential Commission on Large Scale Farms in Makuyu- Muranga.  Further, it is evident that the suit property was a subject of case  Cooperative tribunal Case no. 452 of 2011, wherein a Status Report was given by the Liquidators of the 2
nd
 Defendant. This Liquidators were appointed by the court vide court order date.






109.
In the said Status Report, the Liquidators confirmed that the Plaintiff herein Peter Gichuhi Wainaina, appeared before them and produced some documents in support of his claim that he owned the suit land. The Liquidators also confirmed that during the meeting, the immediate former management Committee members of the 2
nd
 Defendant were present.






110.
On page 5 of the said Status Report, it is indicated “ upon perusal of the documents presented by the claimant( Peter Gichuhi Wainaina), the entire former management committee members concurred that the said documents were genuine and further acknowledged that the claimant was a fully paid up member of the society, other than knowing him personally……. The former management committee members too agreed that the claimant ( Peter Gichuhi Wainaina), was the rightful owner of the parcel of land in issue being Mitubiri/ Wempa/ Block 2/ 2670, under Ballot Card 26B.






111.
With the above observation, then the court would be tempted to hold that the Peter Gichuhi Wainaina,  is the owner of the suit land. However, it is evident that on the same page, the Liquidators also observed that the former Management Committee members of the 2
nd
 Defendant had also acknowledged that there was a dispute between the Society and the Plaintiff, over the said suit Land which had being issued to another person, and the committee was not in a position to explain how that was done.






112.
This Status Report, contained in the Plaintiff’s List of documents, which was in possession of the 1
st
 Defendant before the suit began. The Plaintiff has questioned the 1
st
 Defendant ownership of the suit property, and authenticity of her documents. Unfortunately, the 2
nd
 Defendant did not participate in this case, and the available evidence is the one given by the Plaintiff and 1
st
 Defendant.






113.
Though the 1
st
 Defendant alleged that she purchased the suit land from a purchaser who had purchased from thr original owner,  Joseph Mwangi Kamau,  and she produced documents to that effect, there was no evidence availed to confirm that indeed  Joseph Mwangi Kamau,  was a genuine member of the 2
nd
 Defendant, as it was confirmed for the Plaintiff herein through the Status Report, and the letter from the Ministry of Agriculture , Livestock , Fisheries and Cooperatives State Department for Cooperatives dated  12
th
 May 2021.  In this referenced letter, it was confirmed that  Peter Gichuhi Wainaina ,  was a bonafide member of the Society. No such confirmation was made for 1
st
 Defendant, and the alleged former members of the Society, who owned the suit property before it was transferred to the 1
st
 Defendant.






114.
Further, a look at the documents produced by the 1
st
 Defendant show a lot of cancellation of dates and names. There was no independent witness from the 2
nd
 D efendant called to confirm that indeed, that is how transfer of a parcel of land is done, through cancellation of original documents. The P laintiff’s documents do not contain such cancellations, and this court finds that the Plaintiff’s documents in support of his ownership are more probable the authentic ones than the ones produced by the 1
st
 Defendant, which are full of cancellations.






115.
The 1
st
 Defendant alleged that she purchased the suit land from Josphat Kibe Nyoike,  who was not called as a witness. Further, she alleged that the said purchase was done through her father Richard Kiguru, now deceased, but she had donated the  Power of Attorney  to him. The said Power of Attorney was not produced, as exhibit, and this court cannot confirm with certainty that indeed,  Richard Kiguru,  carried out the transaction for purchase of the suit land on behalf of 1
st
 Defendant, as a holder of the Power of Attorney.






116.
Having held that there was no evidence that Richard Kiguru transacted on behalf of 1
st
 Defendant vide Power of Attorney, and having held that the Plaintiff root of his ownership documents is retraceable and looks more genuine and authentic than the one produced by the 1
st
 Defendant, and having held that the 1
st
 Defendant acquire her title deed, during the active prosecution of the case before the Cooperative tribunal, and thus offended the doctrine of Lis Pendens, this court finds and holds that the Plaintiff herein is the rightful owner of the suit land. This position was also confirmed by the former Management committee members through the  Status Report,  prepared by the Liquidators, which Status Report was not Challenged by the 1
st
 Defendant herein.








ii).Whether title issued in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant should be cancelled?


117.
Having found that the Plaintiff is the rightful owner of the suit land, then as provided by section 24 of the 
Land Registration Act
, then he has the right to enjoy all the rights and privileges appurtenant thereto. Such rights include right to possession, occupation and / or use of the suit land, and even right to own certificate of title over the suit land.






118.
It is evident that the suit land was registered in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant on  24
th
 August 2011, during the active prosecution of the Cooperative Tribunal case, wherein the Plaintiff had sought to be declared the owner of the suit. Before the said suit before the Cooperative tribunal was finalised, the 1
st
 Defendant acquired registration of the suit land, and that acquisition of the title changed the status of the land as it was no longer an unregistered land.






119.
Having acquired the suit land during the pendency of an active case before the tribunal, which challenged ownership of the said land, this court finds that the 1
st
 Defendant did not act in good faith, and thus cannot hold that she is a bonafide owner of the said land, or that she acted in good faith during the said registration. Why could she not wait for the conclusion of the ongoing case?






120.
This court had found and held that the Plaintiff herein is the rightful owner of the suit land, and that the root of the 1
st
 Defendant title was suspect, and therefore this court cannot hold that she is an absolute and indefeasible owner.






121.
Though section 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
, provides that the registration of a person through certificate of title is taken and held that such person or registration of such proprietor is the conclusive proof that the said person/ proprietor is the owner of the property, such title can be impeached as provided by said Section 26, subsection 1(a) & (b) of the said Act.






122.
Therefore, from the above proviso, it is clear that the holding of a certificate of title is not absolute, and the said title can be impeached, if there is proof of any of the circumstances mentioned above. See the case of Alice Chemutai Too vs Nickson Kipkurui Korir & 2 Others [2015] eKLR, where the Court held as follows:
“
It will be seen from the above that title is protected, but the protection is removed and title can be impeached, if it is procured through fraud or misrepresentation, to which the person is proved to be a party; or where it is procured illegally, unprocedurally, or through a corrupt scheme.”






123.
The court has found and held that the Plaintiff herein has established the root of his title, which ownership was confirmed by the former members of the management committee of the 2
nd
 Defendant, vide the Status Report. The 1
st
 Defendant title was issued in 2011, and thus The Registered 
Land Act
 Cap 300 ( repealed) is applicable. However, most of the provisions of this repealed Cap 300, are mirrored in the 
Land Registration Act
 of 2012.






124.
Having found that the Plaintiff is the rightful owner of the suit land, and that the 1
st
 Defendant title was acquired in contravention of the doctrine of Lis Pendens, which doctrine should now come to the aid of the Plaintiff, who has been found to own the suit land, the 1
st
 Defendant title is a candidate for cancellation.






125.
Further, even if there was a double allocation of the suit Plot to two members of the 2
nd
 Defendant, which has not been proved, since the 1
st
 Defendant did not avail herself or her documents to the Liquidators who prepared the Status Report to confirm if indeed, Joseph Mwangi Kamau,  the alleged original owner was a genuine member of the society, this court finds that the Plaintiff was the first allottee, thus the first in time.






126.
As has been held severally by our courts, when two equities are equal, the first in time prevails. See the case of  Gitwany Investment Limited vs Tajmal limited & Others( 2006) eklr,  where the court held Paragraph 
127
, where the Court stated that:
“
My understanding is therefore that the title given to Gitwany in the first instance and which I have held to be absolute and indefeasible as regards the suit land is the earlier grant and in the words of the Court of Appeal in Wreck Motors Enterprises vs. commissioner of Lands, C.A. No. 71/1997 (unreported) “– is the “grant [that] takes priority. The land is alienated already.” This decision was again upheld in Faraj Maharus vs. J.B. Martin glass Industries and 3 others C.A 130/2003 (unreported). Like equity keeps teaching us, the first in time prevails so that in the event such as this one where, by a mistake that is admitted, the Commissioner of Lands issues two titles in respect of the same parcel for land, then if both are apparently and in the fact to them, issued regularly and procedurally without fraud save for the mistake, then the first in time must prevail. It must prevail because without cancellation of the original title, it retains its sanctity….”






127.
Further in the case of  M’Ikiara M’rinkanya & Another vs Gilbert Kabeere M’binjiwe ( 1982-1988) 1 KAR 196,  the court held that in instances where there are double allocations, the first allotment would prevail, since after first allotment, there was no power to allot the same property again.






128.
The 1
st
 Defendant’s title having been obtained in 2011, then section 143(1) of the Registered 
Land Act
(repealed), mirrored under section 80(1) of the 
Land Registration Act
, is Applicable herein. It provides as follows:
“
Subject to subsection (2), the court may order the rectification of the register by directing that any registration be cancelled or amended if it is satisfied that any registration was obtained, made or omitted by fraud or mistake.”






129.
The court of Appeal in the case of  
Munyu Maina v Hiram Gathiha Maina, COA Civil Appeal NO. 239 of 2009
,  held as follows:
“
We state that when a registered proprietor’s root of title is under challenge, it is not sufficient to dangle the instrument of title as proof of ownership. It is this instrument of title that is in challenge and the registered proprietor must go beyond the instrument and prove the legality of how he acquired the title and show that the acquisition was legal, formal and free from any encumbrances….”.






130.
From the above provisions of law and decided cases, it is evident that the 1
st
 Defendant’s title which was acquired under unclear circumstances is impeachable and is thus a candidate for cancellation, and rectification of the register as provided by section 80(1) of 
Land Registration Act
 2012.






131.
Consequently, this court proceed to cancel the said certificate of title issued in the name of the 1
st
 Defendant, as the said land belongs to the Plaintiff, who is the legal owner, and should be registered in his name. Therefore, it is fair and just that the register for the suit land should be rectified, and the said land be registered in the name of the Plaintiff, who balloted and was allotted the same in 1988, and who is a genuine member of the 2
nd
 Defendant since 1980, as is evident from his Share Certificate No. 2616.








iii).        Who should bear costs of the suit?


132.
The issue of costs is provided for by Section 27 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, which provides that costs are granted at the discretion of the court. However, ordinarily costs follow the event and is granted to the successful litigant, unless there are exceptional circumstances existing in the case that would warrant the court to depart from this position. See the case of Morgan Air Cargo Limited v Everest Enterprises Limited [2014] eKLR the court noted that;
“
The exercise of the discretion, however, depends on the circumstances of each case. Therefore, the law in designing the legal phrase that ‘’Costs follow the event’’ was driven by the fact that there could be no ‘’one-size-fit-all’’ situation on the matter. That is why section 27(1) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 is couched the way it appears in the statute; and even all literally works and judicial decisions on costs have recognized this fact and were guided by and decided on the facts of the case respectively. Needless to state, circumstances differ from case to case.”






133.
In the instance suit, the Plaintiff herein is the successful litigant, and this court finds no exceptional circumstances exists and thus the Plaintiff being the successful litigant is entitled to costs of the suit.






134.
For the above reasons, this court finds and holds that the Plaintiff has proved his case on the required standard of balance of probabilities. Therefore, this court enters judgement in favour of the Plaintiff herein, as against the Defendants herein jointly and severally in terms of prayers No 1, 2 and 4 of the Plaint dated 6
th
 July 2021.






135.
On the issue of General Damages, as sought in prayer No.3, there was no evidence adduced to support a claim for general damages, and thus this prayer will not be awarded as sought by the Plaintiff.
Judgement is entered accordingly.

On 3

 May 2024 filed in Kisumu CM Criminal Case No. E223 of 2024 shows that the convict has an 8 year old child, J. O and other minor children. She admitted the offence. The illicit brew is indeed destructive. But the minor children will suffer more if their mother remains in jail longer. She has been in jail for 3 months out of the 6 months’ imprisonment. The minor children were left in the custody of their aged grandmother. The convict is a first offender who pleaded guilty to the charge.






4.
I exercise discretion in the spirit of prison decongestion and order that the remainder of the 3 months’ imprisonment is suspended for six (6) months not to commit any offence and the convict Benta Awino Onyango is ordered released from prison forthwith unless otherwise lawfully held.

N THE MATTER OF THE CHILDREN ACT,  CAP 141 OF THE LAWS OF KENYA


AND 


IN THE MATTER OF ADOPTION B.N alias M.M.  (MINOR)








Judgment










1.
The Applicants filed an Originating Summons dated 11 March 2024, Statement in Support of the Application for an Adoption Order and Affidavit in Support of the Application, seeking:
i.
That the Applicants be authorised to adopt B.N., a minor who is to be known as B.A.N.M, and the Registrar General be directed to enter this adoption into the Register of Adoptions;
ii.
That J.M.N and R.M.M be appointed as the legal guardians of the minor;
iii.
That the child be presumed to be born in Muranga County in the Republic of Kenya;






2.
The matter was canvassed by way of viva voce evidence on the virtual platform.






The Child


3.
The child (female) was born on 23 September 2007. The child was rescued from by members of the public after she was dumped by her mother. The matter was reported to the Muranga Police Station vide OB No. 32/24/9/07. The child was taken to Muranga Medical Hospital for medical care and thereafter committed to the Nest Children Home by the Children Court in Muranga in Case No. 18 of 2007.






4.
The child was placed with the Applicants on 30 January 2010 and has been in their care and control ever since. She is a Form 3 student enrolled at Precious Blood School, Juja. At the hearing, the child identified the Applicants as her parents and indicated that she would glad to be adopted by them.






5.
The child was declared free for adoption by Change Trust Adoption Society vide certificate serial number 677.








The Applicants


6.
The Applicants are Kenyan citizens, aged 56 years and 55 years, respectively. They have been married since 2001 and reside in Kiambu county. During their marriage, the Applicants were blessed with 2 children.






7.
The 1st Applicant is employed by the Library of Congress, US Embassy, while the 2nd Applicant is a business lady. The Applicants confirmed that they are financially capable of providing and caring for the child. They have lived with the child since 2010 and supported her in all her needs. They confirmed that they fully understand the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.






8.
No copies of Bank Statements or payslips were presented before the Court, thus forcing the court to rely on the Reports by the Adoption Society and the Director of Children Services on the capability of the Applicants to meet the financial needs of the child. The Applicants presented copies of their Medical Reports and Certificates of Good Conduct as proof that they are financially, emotional and socially capable of handling parental responsibilities and raising the child in a loving, nurturing environment.






9.
The Applicants proposed J.M.N and R.M.M to be the legal guardians of the child. The proposed legal guardians are a couple and had filed their consents dated 31 May 2024. JMM is a brother to the 2nd Applicant. They confirmed that they fully understand the implications of the order and had willingly consented to the appointment.






10.
Efforts to trace the biological parents of the child proved futile. A letter dated 9 December 2009 from the Muranga Police Station indicates that by that time, no relatives had come forth to claim the child. I, therefore, dispense with the requirement for consent from the biological parents.








The Adoption Application


11.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed in a bid to determine whether the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.






12.
Change Trust Adoption Society conducted an assessment of the Applicants and filed a report dated 28 May 2024.






13.
On 13 Junel 2024, the Court issued an order appointing Hopkins Ochieng Okeyo as the child’s Guardian ad Litem, and further directing the Guardian ad Litem and Director of Children’s Services to investigate the suitability and fitness of the Applicant and subsequently file their respective reports.






14.
The Guardian ad Litem filed his report dated 16 July 2024, recommending the adoption. The Directorate of Children’s Services filed its report dated 15 July 2024, recommending the adoption of the child by the Applicants herein.






15.
From the material availed and oral testimonies, I am satisfied that the Applicants are quite suited to be adoptive parents.






16.
Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicants, E.M.N. and J.N.N, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Baby B.N alias M.M.;
ii.
That henceforth, the child shall be known as B.A.N.M;
iii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iv.
J.M.N and R.M.M are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,
v.
The Guardian 
ad Litem
 is hereby discharged;
vi.
That the Registrar-General is directed to make the appropriate entries in the Adopted Children’s Register;

 December 2019 by Kenya Children’s Home Adoption Society (KCHAP) vide freeing Certificate Serial Number 1918.






4.
There is a consistent message that there is the urge for PGK and LWG to have children of their own and their motivation to provide for an abandoned child.






5.
The child is a Kenyan citizen by Article 14 (1), which provides that a person is a citizen by birth if on the day of the person’s birth, whether or not the person is born in Kenya, either the mother or father of the person is a citizen.






6.
In light of the best interests of the child principle provided for under Article 53 (2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010. Sections 8 (1), (2), and (3) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
 and the 1
st
 Schedule of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
, this Court must prioritize the child’s best interests in making decisions touching on her.
a.
Article 53 of 
the Constitution
, 2010 states that a child’s best interests are paramount in every matter concerning the child.
b.
Sections 8 (1), (2) and (3) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
 provides as follows;
1.

a.
The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;
b.
The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule.
2.
All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to: -
a.
safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;
b.
conserve and promote the welfare of the child; and
c.
secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in public interest.
3.
In any matters affecting a child, the child shall be accorded an opportunity to express their opinion, and that opinion shall be taken into account in appropriate cases, having regard to the child’s age and degree of maturity.
c.
The First Schedule, as provided for under Section 8 (1) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
, provides best interests considerations to be as follows:
1.
The age, maturity, stage of development, gender, background, and any other relevant characteristics of the child.
2.
Distinct special needs (if any) arising from chronic ailment or disability.
3.
The relationship of the child with the child’s parent (s) and/ or guardian (s) and any other persons who may significantly affect the child’s welfare.
4.
The preference of the child, if old enough, to express a meaningful preference.






5.
The duration and adequacy of the child’s current living arrangements and the desirability of maintaining continuity.






6.
The stability of any proposed living arrangements for the child.






7.
The motivation of the parties involved and their capacities to give the child love, affection, and guidance.






8.
The child’s adjustment to the child’s present home, school, and community.






9.
The capacity of each parent or guardian to allow and encourage frequent and continuing contact between the child and the other parent and/ or guardian (s), including physical access.






10.
The capacity of each parent and/ or guardian (s) to cooperate or to learn to cooperate in child care.






11.
Methods for assisting parental and/ or guardian cooperation and resolving disputes and each parent’s/ guardian’s willingness to use those methods.






12.
The effect of the child if one parent/ guardian has sole authority over the child’s upbringing.






13.
The existence of domestic abuse between the parents/ guardian (s), in the past or currently, and how that abuse affects the emotional stability and physical safety of the child.






14.
The existence of any history of child abuse by a parent and/ or guardian (s); or anyone residing in the same dwelling as the child.






15.
Where the child is under one year of age, whether the child is being breast-fed.






16.
The existence of a parent’s (s) or guardian’s (s) conviction for a sex offense or a sexually violent offense under the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






17.
Where there is a person residing with a parent or guardian, whether that person -
a.
Has been convicted of a crime under this Act, the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the Penal Code, or any other legislation.
b.
Has been adjudicated of a juvenile offence which, if the person had been an adult at the time of the offence, the person would have been convicted of a felony.






18.
Any other factor which may have a direct or indirect effect on the physical and psychological well-being of the child.






19.
The report from the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection State Department for Social Protection and Senior Citizen Affairs – Department of Children’s Services (Nairobi County), the report from Buckner Kenya Adoption Services (BKAS) Adoption Society, the guardian ad litem and the proposed legal guardians indicate that the child is well known to the adoptive parents and that he will be well taken care of in their care and custody.






20.
I find that this adoption gives the child a chance at a better life and education in a loving and stable home with the adoptive parents.






21.
In the circumstances, I allow the originating summons dated 8
th
 September, 2022 and make the following orders:
a.
The Applicants PGK and LWG are authorized to adopt the child known as BH, aka ABB.
b.
Upon adoption, the child shall be known as SKG.
c.
The child is declared a Kenyan citizen by birth and is entitled to all rights and benefits under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, and all applicable laws.
d.
PGK and LWG are appointed legal guardians of the child.
e.
The Registrar General is directed to make the relevant entries in the Adopted Children’s Register in respect of the child.
f.
The Registrar of Births and Deaths is directed to issue a birth certificate in respect of the child’s new name.






22.

Ramadhan George Mwakangalu


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (From the conviction and sentence in Sexual Offence Case No. E007 of 2023 at Taveta Law Courts delivered by Hon. C. L. Adisa (SRM)  on 11th July 2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant was convicted in the Magistrate’s court with defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006, the particulars of which being that on diverse dates between the months of September 2022 to 14
th
 January 2023 at unknown time at Cess village of Taveta Sub County within Taita Taveta County, intentionally and unlawfully inserted his penis into the vagina of C.N.A a minor aged 15 years.






2.
On conviction, he was sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment.






3.
Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, the appellant has come to this court on appeal on the following amended grounds:-
1.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by failing to find that no any medical examination was done upon him at all.
2.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by convicting and sentencing him by the evidence of a single witness of framing and fabrication and also evidence of incrimination.
3.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by failing to find that no DNA was done to prove that he was the one who impregnated the said girl CNO, the (minor) girl of 15 years old.
4.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by failing to find that the crucial witnesses were never availed in court i.e. arresting officers and the father of the girl who is said to have informed his wife, aunt of the girl that there is a man who has been jumping over the fence, having sex with the girl and also the neighbours who told him.
5.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and facts by relying on the evidence of hearsay and evidence of being told not of eye witness.
6.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and facts by relying on contradicted evidences which were inconsistent, having discrepancies, immaterial and cannot base a safe conviction upon the accused person.
7.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by relying on circumstantial evidence which could not sustain a safe conviction upon him at all.
8.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred both in law and fact by convicting and sentencing him by poor investigation conducted upon him.






4.
The appeal was canvassed through written submissions. In this regard, I have perused and considered the submissions filed by the appellant as well as the submissions filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I note that the Director of Public Prosecutions has conceded to the appeal on the ground that the appellant was not positively identified as the culprit.






5.
This being a first appeal, I am duty bound to evaluate all the evidence on record afresh and come to my own independent conclusions and inferences – see Okeno =Versus= Republic (1972) EA 32.






6.
In doing so, I am not bound to agree with the findings of the trial Magistrate, nor to agree with the submissions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.






7.
In proving their case, the prosecution called four (4) witnesses. On his part, the appellant tendered unsworn defence testimony.






8.
The main ingredients of the offence of defilement on which the appellant was convicted are first, the age of the complainant who should be less than 18 years. The second ingredient is sexual penetration even if partial. The third ingredient, is the positive identification of the culprit.






9.
From the evidence on record from the complainant PW1 CNA, who testified that she was 15 years old, and the evidence of PW2 JNS PW1’s guardian, who produced the birth certificate of PW1 in court as an exhibit with an entry that PW1 was born on 16
th
 August 2007, in my view the prosecution proved the age of the complainant beyond any reasonable doubt.






10.
With regard to sexual penetration, PW3 George Ombayo a Clinician at Taveta Sub County hospital testified to medical ultrasound examination done on PW1 at Amina Dispensary by a sonographer Mr. Kirwa, and a Clinician called Felicia, to establish a pregnancy of 18 ½ weeks in the womb of PW1.






11.
In my view, this evidence was hearsay evidence and it did not comply with the requirements of Section 77 of the 
Evidence Act
 (Cap.80), as PW1 neither stated that he knew and worked with the alleged examining medical officials, nor knew their handwriting. Such evidence, in law, cannot be used to establish a fact.






12.
I thus find that the prosecution did not prove sexual penetration on the complainant beyond any reasonable doubt.






13.
With regard to the identity of the appellant as the culprit, I find that the evidence of PW1 the complainant, and PW2 her guardian, did not prove that the appellant was the culprit, as the evidence of PW2 was to the effect that she was informed by her husband who was also informed by somebody else, that the appellant was the culprit.






14.
That evidence was thus hearsay evidence and it not being able to be tested through coss-examination, cannot establish a fact.






15.
I thus agree with the Prosecuting Counsel that the prosecution did not prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant was the culprit.






16.
Thus the prosecution not having proved two of the crucial ingredients of the offence of defilement, this appeal will succeed.






17.
Consequently and for the above reasons, I allow the appeal quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. I order that the appellant be set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held.

Between




Daniel Kamau Maina


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal against the judgment on re-sentencing in the Chief Magistrate Court at Nyeri by Honourable W. Kagendo, in Criminal Petition No. 1295 of 2020 on 12th January, 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Daniel Kamau Maina, the appellant herein, was charged and convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 with an Alternative Charge of Committing an Indecent Act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No.3 of 2006 in Kangema Principal Magistrate’s Court Criminal Case No. 328 of 2014. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.






2.
The Appellant lodged an appeal against the conviction and sentence at the High Court at Muranga, Criminal Appeal no. 122 of 2014. The appeal was dismissed and the life sentence was upheld by Mshila, J.






3.
The Appellant thereafter petitioned for re-sentencing before the Nyeri Chief Magistrate’s Court - Criminal Petiti
on no. 1295 of 2020
 seeking, inter alia, that the court considers re-sentencing him in line with the Supreme Court decision in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs. Republic SCK Petition No. 15 & 16 of 2015 (2017) eKLR. The petition was dismissed and the Appellant lodged the present appeal.






4.
The Appellant filed a petition of appeal on 25
th
 January 2021 and an amended petition of appeal on the 11
th
 October 2022. The appellant has advanced the following grounds;
“
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in imposing harsh and excessive sentences thereby overlooking the mitigating circumstances of the case;
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider that I was a first offender, rehabilitated and remorseful which were crucial factors to consider during resentencing thereby ignoring the offenders’ personal circumstances;
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider that the mandatory sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 impinge on a fair trial guaranteed under Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 and that the Appellant was prejudiced by being deprived the right to mitigation and the right to a lesser severe sentence which amounts to discrimination contrary to Article 27 of 
the Constitution
;
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both fact and law in abusing her discretion when sentencing the Appellant and failed to apply the Judiciary Sentencing Guidelines [2013].""






5.
The Appellant has asked the court to set aside the life imprisonment sentence and substitute the same with a non-custodial sentence, with consideration to the time spent in remand during trial and after conviction.






6.
The Appellant in his submissions invited the court to consider the emerging jurisprudence on minimum/mandatory sentences for offences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 in setting aside the sentence. The submissions also offer mitigating factors for consideration.






7.
The Respondent filed submissions and conceded to the ground for re-sentencing.






8.
I have carefully read the documents and submissions filed by the parties. There have been 4 cases in different courts over the Appellant’s conviction and sentence.






9.
The issue for determination in this appeal is only on re-sentencing. This Court takes cognizance of the challenges that were posed with the various interpretations of the decision in the Muruatetu Case and also that there is no standard procedure on how parties can move the court in re-sentencing applications.






10.
The Magistrate’s Court had no jurisdiction to hear the re-sentencing petition that was presented in the Nyeri Chief Magistrate’s Court- Criminal Petiti
on no. 1295 of 2020
. This is because the Appellant’s Appeal via Murang’a Criminal Appeal no. 122 of 2014 had already been heard and determined before the High Court. The High Court at Murang’a had upheld the conviction and sentence and that should have been the correct court to approach for the re-sentencing petition. There was no order remitting the case back to the Magistrate’s Court for re-sentencing hearing.






11.
I proceeded to consider the question of whether the appellant’s case merits consideration for re-sentencing based on the grounds advanced.






12.
The High Court in Murang’a Criminal Appeal No. 122 of 2014 addressed itself on the allegations by the Appellant that he was not accorded a fair trial. The Judge made a finding that the Appellant had been accorded a fair trial and that there was no procedural flaw at the lower court proceedings. (Paragraphs 25 to 30 in Judgment dated 2
nd
 December 2016). The record shows that the Appellant opted not to cross-examine the witnesses and remained silent when he was invited to offer his mitigation. The right, which is a core component of a fair trial contemplated under Article 50(1) of 
the Constitution
, was afforded but not utilized. The Appellant was not discriminated against nor deprived of his right to mitigate as indicated in the petition and submissions.






13.
The Appellant appealed against the sentence and conviction in Muranga Criminal Appeal No. 122 of 2014 and the Court examined the fidelity of the sentence. The Judge made a finding that the same was neither harsh nor excessive. The Court noted that the age of the victim – 5 ½ years, had been considered by the trial court. The sentence of life imprisonment was with consideration of all factors and circumstances. It was not meted on the basis that it was a mandatory/minimum sentence. The authorities relied upon in the submissions were thus not applicable to this case.






14.
On a holistic consideration, the grounds advanced in this appeal all fail. The High Court affirmed the decision of the Trial Court on conviction and sentence. The Appellant ought to have appealed to the Court of Appeal if he was dissatisfied with the determination in Muranga High Court Criminal Appeal 122 of 2014.






15.
While determining this appeal, I addressed myself regarding the indeterminate life sentence which the Court of Appeal has declared unconstitutional.
In 
Manyeso v Republic (Criminal Appeal 12 of 2021
) [2023] KECA 827 (KLR) (7 July 2023) (Judgment), the Court of Appeal sitting in Malindi Nyamweya, Lesiit and Odunga, JJA) held that life imprisonment unconstitutional substituted the same with 40 years. They stated as follows: -
“
We recognize that although the Judiciary released elaborate and comprehensive Sentencing Policy Guidelines in 2016, there are no specific provisions for the sentence of life imprisonment, because it is an indeterminate sentence. Nevertheless, we are in agreement with the High Court decision in Jackson Wangui, supra, which found that it is not for the court to define what constitutes a life sentence or what number of years must first be served by a prisoner on life sentence before they are considered on parole. This is a function within the realm of the Legislature…
… We are therefore of the view that while the appellant should be given the opportunity for rehabilitation, he also merits a deterrent sentence. We, therefore in the circumstances, uphold the appellant’s conviction of defilement, but partially allow his appeal on sentence. We accordingly set aside the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the appellant and substitute therefor a sentence of 40 years in prison to run from the date of his conviction.”






16.
In 
Ayako v Republic (Criminal Appeal 22 of 2018
) [2023] KECA 1563 (KLR) (Okwengu, Omondi & J. Ngugi, JJA) (8 December 2023) (Judgment) translated life imprisonment to 30 years. They stated as follows:-
“
26.
On our part, considering this comparative jurisprudence and the prevailing socio-economic conditions in Kenya, we come to the considered conclusion that life imprisonment in Kenya does not mean the natural life of the convict. Instead, we now hold, life imprisonment translates to thirty years’ imprisonment.
27.
In the circumstances of this case, given the objective severity of the offence committed by the appellant as analysed above, we hereby allow the appeal on sentence to the extent of ordering that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed shall translate to 30 years’ imprisonment. The record shows that the appellant was in custody since he was arraigned in court on July 18, 2011. By dint of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the imprisonment term of 30 years shall be computed to begin running from that date.”






17.
The upshot of the above is that life imprisonment is not left indeterminate.






18.
The Respondent proposed a sentence of 20 years. I have considered the lower court proceedings in Kangema Magistrate’s Court Criminal Case 328 of 2014, the probation officer’s report filed in Nyeri Chief Magistrate’s Court- Criminal Petiti
on no. 1295 of 2020
 that gives the victim assessment report, the report by the State Department for Correctional Services, the appellant’s age and submissions on record. The life imprisonment sentence imposed on the Appellant is hereby translated into 30 years.






19.
I therefore substitute the life sentence, with its equivalent, that is 30 years. The period shall run as per Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code from the date of arraignment in court.






20.
It is so ordered.

and




Elias Bare Shiili


 


Respondent










Ruling










1.
The Applicant filed a Notice of Motion Applicant Dated 28
th
 March, 2024 together with a Reference Dated 28
th
 March, 2024 seeking a raft of orders against the Respondent and supported by the affidavit dated of the Respondent Dated 28
th
 March, 2024.






2.
The said application was opposed vide a Replying Affidavit Dated 5
th
 April, 2024 and further supported by the Applicant’s Supplementary Affidavit Dated 30
th
 April, 2024.






3.
The Applicant contends that the Respondent is attempting to illegally evict him from the suit property even when he has paid rent for all the duration that he has been in occupation of the demised property.






4.
There exist a Lease Agreement Dated 1
st
 September, 2023 between the Applicant and the Respondent. The said lease does not indicate how the rent for the said premises is to be paid. The receipts produced by the Applicant indicates that the rent of kshs 40,000/= was paid to Shamsha Haji Sigara.






5.
The mode of payment has been consistent and it is paid up to date and as thus I have no doubt that all the alleged outstanding arrears have been paid to Shamsha Haji Sigara and receipt issued.






6.
Based on the foregoing, the only issue for this court’s determination is whether the Applicant has defaulted in Rent Payment to warrant distress as done by the Respondent?






Analysis And Determination


7.
Before delving into the issue I wish to note that Section 4(1) of Cap 301 provides that no tenancy shall be terminated, or no term or condition, or right or service enjoyed by the tenant shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act.






8.
The Act further provides for the grounds on which the Landlord may seek to terminate the tenancy in Section 7 the grounds stated under this provision and which are applicable herein include; -
i.
That the tenant has defaulted in paying rent for a period of two months after such rent has become due or payable or has persistently delayed in paying rent which has become due or payable;
ii.
That the tenant has committed other substantial breaches of his obligations under the tenancy, or for any other reason connected with the tenant’s use or management of the premises comprised in the tenancy; and
iii.
That on the termination of the tenancy the landlord intends to demolish or reconstruct the premises comprised in the tenancy, or a substantial part thereof, or to carry out substantial work of construction on such premises or part thereof, and that he could not reasonably do so without obtaining possession of such premises;






9.
The applicant has demonstrated in clear terms how rent for the demised property has been paid, how much has been paid and to whom. This Court notes that the Respondent has not denied any involvement with Shamsha Haji Sigara.






10.
The Lease Agreement Dated 1
st
 September, 2023 does not indicate how rent is to be paid and how much is payable. In absence of such information, the Honourable Court is only left to presume that indeed the Applicant has been paying rent as agreed.






11.
This court is alive to the facts that it is only upon nonpayment of Rent an applicant that the Respondent can decide and/or is allowed to levy distress over the demised property.






12.
The right to levy distress is reserved under Section 3 of the Distress for Rent Act, Cap 293 of the Laws of Kenya, which provides; -
“
subject to the provisions of this Act and having any rent or rent service in arrears and due upon a grant, lease, demise or contract shall have the same remedy by distress for the recovery of that rent or rent service as is given by the Common Law of England in a similar case.”






13.
In seeking to make the appropriate orders in view of the foregoing, I am guided by section 12(1)(e) of Cap 301 which grants the Tribunal power; -
“
To make orders upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit for the recovery of possession and for the payment of arrears of rent and mesne profits which orders may be applicable to any person whether or not he is a Tenant, being at any material time in occupation of the premises comprised in a controlled tenancy.”






14.
That it is with no doubt in my mind that Applicant there is not in arrears and the Respondent has not demonstrated justifiable reasons why they should be entitled to distress for the alleged rent owing from the Applicant.






15.
Though there exist Orders from Environment and Land Court on Status Quo, the Status Quo is defined and does not include payment of rent or otherwise as thus they do not divest this Honourable Court mandates to give orders on rent payment.






16.
Before concluding this ruling, I wish to adopt what the superior court stated in the case of Samuel Kipkori Ngeno & Another – vs- Local Authorities Pension Trust (Registered Trustees) & Another (2013) eKLR at paragraphs 9 and 12 as follows: -
“
9
A tenant’s first and main obligation is to pay rent as and when it becomes due, for the Landlord has the right to an income from his investment….”
“12
The temporary injunction sought in the present application is an equitable remedy at the court’s discretion. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands. A tenant who is in huge arrears of rent is underserving the court’s discretion. The court cannot be the refuge of a tenant who fails to meet his principle obligation of paying rent as and when it becomes due”.






17.
In the circumstances of this case, I will therefore allow the Applicant’s Application Dated 28
th
 March, 2024 in the following terms; -
i.
The Respondent, his agents, servants, assignees, employees, or people acting under his instructions and Particularly Recovery Concept Auctioneers are Permanently Restrained from encroaching upon, occupying, alienating, constructing, taking any step to enter or in any way whatsoever interfering with the Applicant’s Quiet Possession of Premises Known as Garissa Township/Block 1/72 situated in Garissa Town.
ii.
The OCS Garissa Township Police Station to ensure compliance.
iii.
Each party to bear their own costs.

g.
That her receipts got burnt in the premises.
h.
That she cannot remember the last time she paid rent.
i.
That the Tenant is at the premises and continues to take care of the same.








Analysis and determination


8.
The only issue that arises for determinations in this case is whether the Landlord has proved his notice to terminate tenancy and what orders then the court ought to make under the provisions of Section 9 of Cap 301.






9.
The Landlord’s notice to terminate tenancy is brought on the grounds;
a.
That the Tenant has basically failed to pay rent and has arrears amounting to Kshs. 84,000/=.
b.
That the Landlord intends to use the premises for a period of not less than one (1) year for purposes of carrying out a retail shop.






10.
The Landlord testified that he purchased the suit premises from one Mr. Alex Sialala and the property was transferred to the Landlord on 1.09.2022. It is the Landlord’s evidence that he found Tenants in the suit premises amongst them, the Tenant herein. It is the evidence of the Landlord that while the other Tenants continued to pay rent, the Tenant herein refused to pay any rent and has accumulated rent arrears amounting to Kshs. 84,000/=. In regard to this issue, the Tenant denied owing the Landlord any rent and stated that she could not remember the last time that she paid rent as her receipts got burnt in the suit premises.






11.
It is evident that the suit premises belong to the Landlord having purchased the same from one Mr. Alex Sialala. The Tenant acknowledges this purchase and transfer of the suit property and only contends that the Landlord did not inform her that he had purchased the property. It is further evident that the Tenant has not paid rent for the suit premises to the new Tenant and she cannot continue clinging to the previous owner who is no longer her Landlord and therefore not entitled to any rent. In this regard, I am satisfied that the Landlord has established the ground of termination of the tenancy on the basis of non-payment of rent. Under the provisions of Section 7(1)(b0 of Cap 301, the Landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy;
“
where the tenant has defaulted in paying rent for a period of two (2) months after such rent has become due or payable or has persistently delayed in paying rent which has become due or payable.”






12.
The Tenant has expressly stated in her evidence that she does not have any dispute with the Landlord herein. The Landlord has also confirmed that he has not filed any other case against the Tenant in any other court. What therefore emerges from the proceedings and evidence is that the Tenant has had several run ins with one Mr. Alex Sialala who was the previous owner of the suit premises. Mr. Alex Sialala no longer has any property interests in the premises and nor is he the Landlord of the Tenant. In these circumstances, the Tenant is at liberty to pursue the said Mr. Alex Sialala for any wrongs that the Tenant considers to have been brought about by the said Alex Sialala. It is not fair in these circumstances to visit the presumed sins of MR. SIALALA upon the shoulders of the Landlord.






13.
It is my finding therefore that the Landlord has proved his notice to terminate tenancy against the Tenant on account of the Tenant’s default in rent payment.








Disposition


14.
Consequent to the above findings, I make the following orders;-
a.
That the Tenant between the parties is hereby terminated.
b.
That the Tenant shall render vacant possession of the premises within the next thirty (30) days of this Judgment failing which the Landlord will be at liberty to evict the Tenant using a licensed Auctioneer.
c.
That the Tenant will pay the outstanding rent arrears of Kshs. 84,000/=, failing which the Landlord will be at liberty to levy distress for the same.
d.
That the Tenant will bear the costs of this suit.
e.
This file is ordered closed on these terms.

Respondent










Judgment










1.
The appellant was tried and convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The particulars of the offence were that; on 26
th
 august 2011 at [Particulars Withheld], Murang’a County, caused his genital organ namely penis to penetrate the anus of PNK, a child aged 9 years.






2.
Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, he filed a petition of appeal on 6
th
 May 2015 wherein he listed seven (7) grounds of appeal. Subsequently, he filed amended grounds of appeal together with his written submissions.






3.
The appeal was disposed of by way of written submissions.






4.
The appellant relied wholly on the written submissions mentioned above.






5.
The respondent contests the appeal through written submissions dated 27
th
 May 2024.






6.
As a first appellate court, I must reconsider and evaluate the evidence in the court below to arrive at an independent conclusion while bearing in mind that I did not hear or see the witness. In Kiilu & Another v Republic, [2005] 1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal set out the duties of a first appellate court as follows:
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”






7.
Guided by the above principle, I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the evidence presented before the trial court, and the written submissions filed on behalf of the parties. I have also read the judgment of the trial court. Having done so, I find that the issue for my determination is whether the prosecution established the charges brought against the Appellant to the required standard of proof beyond any reasonable doubt and whether the conviction was safe.






8.
The complainant was a child of tender years who gave sworn evidence. The appellant submitted that the voire dire examination was improperly conducted. The record shows that the trial court conducted a voire dire examination and recorded it in terms. The learned trial magistrate was satisfied that the child understood the nature of the oath and the duty of telling the truth. I am content that the trial court employed the correct procedure in ascertaining the child's competence to give evidence. See Johnson Muiruri v Republic [1983] KLR 445.






9.
Turning to whether Section 200 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) was complied with and, if not, the consequences of such non-compliance, if any;
Section 200(3) of the CPC provides: -
“
Where a presiding magistrate commences the hearing of proceedings and part of the evidence has been recorded by his predecessor, the accused person may demand that any witness be re-summoned and re-heard and the succeeding magistrate shall inform the accused person of that right”






10.
In Joseph Kamara Maro v Republic [2014] eKLR the Court of Appeal held that:
“
Our summation of the above is that the appellant was informed of his rights under section 200(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code every time a new Magistrate came on board. The position in law is that a trial magistrate taking over a case that is partly heard is mandatorily obligated to inform an accused person of his right to recall witnesses. After an accused person has been informed of his right, he/she may elect to have the witnesses recalled. What happens thereafter is for the court to decide depending on the availability of witnesses, the length the trial had taken, because if it has taken too long, chances are that some witnesses may have left the jurisdiction of the court as was the case here or some may even have died. To this extent we are in agreement with the learned Judges of the High Court that “this provision does not oblige the succeeding magistrate to start de novo” but what is mandatory is to inform an accused of his right under section 200(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.”






11.
Additionally, in Joseph Kamau Gichuki v Republic [2013] eKLR the Court stated that:
“
This Court has previously held that Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be invoked sparingly and only in cases where the ends of justice will be defeated if a succeeding magistrate does not continue a trial commenced by his predecessor. Some of the considerations to be borne in mind before invoking Section 200 include whether it is convenient to commence the trial de novo, how far the trial had proceeded, availability of witnesses who had already testified, possible loss of memory by the witnesses, the time that had lapsed since the commencement of the trial and the prejudice likely to be suffered by either the prosecution or the accused.”






12.
From the above decisions, it is clear that a succeeding magistrate or judge is not obliged by Section 200(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code to start a trial de novo. The record shows that the prosecution had challenges securing the attendance of the witnesses due to interference and that the complainant’s mother was treated as a refractory witness. The interference can be inferred from the appellant referring the investigating officer to deliberations before the chief to settle the matter. Additionally, the trial court observed the time-lapse and its impact on the minor in the comprehensive ruling delivered on 24
th
 February 2014 on this issue. The provisions of Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code were duly complied with, and I find no fault with that holding.






13.
The ingredients that need to be proved in offence of defilement are;
i.
Age of the victim
ii.
Penetration
iii.
Positive identification of the perpetrator






14.
According to the birth certificate produced, the complainant was born on 11
th
 March 2002. At the time of the incident complained of, he was 9 years and 5 months. I am satisfied that the child's age was established.






15.
The next issue is whether the prosecution proved penetration.
Section 2(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines penetration as: “The partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organ of another person.”
Therefore, penetration, as an essential ingredient of the offence, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.






16.
The complainant, in his evidence in chief, stated that he experienced pain in the anus and stomach and that his stool had blood. PW5, a medical doctor, testified that there was distension in the abdomen, loose anus, and inconsistency of stool. The examination was three days after the date under reference. The evidence on record shows that the complainant was well-oriented and gave a good history during the medical examination. The evidence of the child is corroborated by the medical evidence produced, and penetration into the anus was proven.






17.
The next key question is the identity of the perpetrator. The complainant said that he had gone to see his grandmother and that he ended up at the appellant’s house when he did not find her. PW2 and PW3 reiterated that the appellant was the complainant’s uncle. From the evidence of the complainant, the appellant was in contact with him, they shared a bed for two nights. The complainant’s evidence was that of recognition. It is a well settled principle in criminal law that recognition is a better form of identification than identification of a total stranger.






18.
In the case of Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed and Another v Republic [2018] eKLR, Court had this to say on circumstantial evidence:
“
However, it is a truism that the guilt of an Accused person can be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is evidence which enables a court to deduce a particular fact from circumstances or facts that have been proved. Such evidence can form a strong basis for proving the guilt of an Accused person just as direct evidence. Way back in 1928 Lord Heward, CJ stated as follows on circumstantial evidence in R v Taylor, Weaver and Donovan [1928] Cr. App. R 21: -‘It has been said that the evidence against the Applicant is circumstantial. So it is, but circumstantial evidence is very often the best evidence. It is evidence of surrounding circumstances which, by intensified examination is capable of proving a proposition with the accuracy of mathematics. It is no derogation from evidence to say that it is circumstantial.”






19.
The trial magistrate made a finding that the inculpatory facts show that the penetration occurred when the complainant was with the appellant and that the supposition is that the appellant sexually assaulted the complainant. There was no doubt that the complainant properly identified the Appellant as the perpetrator of the sexual assault.






20.
The totality of the evidence of PW1, PW5, and the medical reports establish the required standard of proof that it was the appellant who sexually assaulted the complainant.






21.
In the end, I concur fully with the learned trial magistrate that all the ingredients of the offense were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant was afforded a fair trial, and the conviction was safe. The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.






22.
I will now turn to the sentence. Under section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to imprisonment for life.






23.
The learned trial magistrate exercised discretion on sentencing and, in doing so, meted a lawful sentence.






24.
Jurisprudence has evolved that life imprisonment is not left indeterminate.
In 
Ayako v Republic (Criminal Appeal 22 of 2018
) [2023] KECA 1563 (KLR) (Okwengu, Omondi & J. Ngugi, JJA) (8 December 2023) (Judgment) translated life imprisonment to 30 years. They stated as follows:-
“
26.
On our part, considering this comparative jurisprudence and the prevailing socio-economic conditions in Kenya, we come to the considered conclusion that life imprisonment in Kenya does not mean the natural life of the convict. Instead, we now hold, life imprisonment translates to thirty years’ imprisonment.
27.
In the circumstances of this case, given the objective severity of the offence committed by the appellant as analysed above, we hereby allow the appeal on sentence to the extent of ordering that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed shall translate to 30 years’ imprisonment. The record shows that the appellant was in custody since he was arraigned in court on July 18, 2011. By dint of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the imprisonment term of 30 years shall be computed to begin running from that date.”






25.
Considering this case's evidence and severity, I translate the life imprisonment to 40 years. In compliance with Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the period the appellant spent in custody before his sentence shall be taken into account, from 16
th
 September 2013 to 28 April 2015.






26.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted with the sentence outlined in paragraph 25 of this judgment.






27.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) (3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. The particulars of the charge were that on the 10
th
 October 2020 at [Particulars Withheld], Murang’a County, the accused caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of MM, a child aged 16 years. The appellant also faced the alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and the case proceeded to full trial with the prosecution calling 5 witnesses. Placed on his defence, the appellant gave unsworn testimony.






2.
In a judgment delivered on 17
th
 March 2022, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and the sentence, he appealed to this court vide a petition of appeal filed on 6
th
 April 2022 in which he raised 9 grounds of appeal which can be summarized as: firstly, that the charge sheet was defective; secondly, that some material witnesses were not called to the stand; thirdly, the evidence by the prosecution did not prove the charge to the required standard of proof; and, lastly, that the learned trial magistrate disregarded the defence proffered by the appellant.






3.
The appellant relied wholly on his written submissions at the hearing of this appeal.






4.
The respondent, on the other hand, orally submitted that the prosecution proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt, and as such, the trial court’s determination was proper in the given circumstances.






5.
This being the first appellate court, I am guided by the principles enunciated in the case of Okeno v Republic (1972) EA 32, where the court of appeal set out the duty of the first appellate court as follows: -
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination (Pandya v R [1957] EA 3365) and the appellate court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusion”.






6.
I have considered and analyzed the evidence which was tendered in the trial court by both the appellant and the prosecution, the grounds of appeal and the written submissions by the parties herein. I find that the issue for determination is whether the prosecution proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt.






7.
I will begin with the issue of a defective charge. The appellant submitted that his conviction was based on a defective charge.






8.
It is clear that the accused was charged with the offence of defilement under Section 8 (1) read with Section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. This is the offence to which he pleaded and in respect of which he defended himself. However, at the time of conviction, the trial Magistrate in fact said:
“
…I accordingly convict the accused herein one Francis Warui Nyambura under section 215 CPC for the offence of defilement C/S 8 (1) as read with section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.”






9.
As the first appellate court, this Court’s role is to re-evaluate the evidence adduced at trial in light of Section 347 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, and reach its own conclusion (Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32). I have no doubt that the offence charged was defilement and that trial was for defilement. The charge was under the wrong section of the law whilst the conviction was correctly meted under Section 8 (4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






10.
This was a non-substantive error. The charge sheet was itself not defective.






11.
Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that unless an error in the judgment has occasioned a failure of justice, the order or sentence of a court shall not be reversed. I hereby invoke the provisions of that section. The Section provides as follows:
“
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on appeal or revision on account of an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment or other proceedings before or during the trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code, unless the error, omission or irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice:
Provided that in determining whether an error, omission or irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice the court shall have regard to the question whether the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings.”






12.
Therefore, I find that the errors submitted by the appellant being non-substantive and curable under section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






13.
Turning now to the main charge. The appellant was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. To prove the offence charged, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of defilement as was stated in the case of George Opondo Olunga v Republic [2016] eKLR that the ingredients of an offence of defilement are: identification or recognition of the offender, penetration and the age of the victim. The prosecution was therefore obliged to establish or prove all the above elements of defilement beyond reasonable doubt.






14.
In the present case, I note that the victim testified that she was 17 years old at the time in question. She produced her birth certificate (Pexh1), which showed that she was born on 29 November 2003. The offence occurred on 1 October 2020. I find that the victim was a minor aged 16 at the time of her attack. I am satisfied that the first ingredient of the complainant's minority age was proved to the required standards.






15.
On the appellant's identity, the appellant was well known to the complainant and in her testimony, she testified that she knew him and that he was from the same area as her mother’s place of birth. In his defence, the appellant stated that PW3 had him arrested as they had a business dispute implying that he and the complainant’s family were well acquainted. To this end, it is my finding that the appellant, who was well known to the complainant and her family, was positively identified. Furthermore, there was no claim of mistaken identity. The appellant was, therefore, identified beyond reasonable doubt.






16.
On the issue of penetration, 'Penetration' is defined under Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 to mean:-
'the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person'.






17.
Penetration can be proved through the victim’s sole testimony or the victim’s testimony corroborated by medical evidence. (See Bassita Hussein vs. Uganda, Supreme Court Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1995) In this case, the totality of the evidence of PW1, PW4, and the medical reports above leave no doubt in my mind that the appellant penetrated the complainant on the material day. His defense, which I outlined earlier, is a sham. In the end, I concur fully with the learned trial magistrate that all the ingredients of the offence were proved beyond reasonable doubt. I find that the conviction was safe. The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.






18.
I will now turn to the sentence. The appellant argued that he was sentenced to a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years imprisonment which has been declared unconstitutional. He argues that the sentence is manifestly harsh and not in compliance with Article 50(2)(p) of 
the Constitution
, which stipulates that an accused person should benefit from the least severe punishment.






19.
The role of this court in an appeal is not to interfere with the discretion of the trial court on the sole ground that the sentence meted out is severe and unless it was manifestly excessive. The Court of Appeal of East Africa stated in Wanjema v Republic [1971] EA 494 that:
“
An appellate court should not interfere with the discretion which a trial court extended as to sentence unless it is evident that it overlooked some material factors, too into account some immaterial factors, acted on the wrong principle or the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case”






20.
The appellant was convicted under Section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. Under that section, a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the ages of sixteen and eighteen is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term not less than fifteen years. The learned trial magistrate imposed a sentence of 15 years imprisonment. I hold the view that the trial court did not act on any wrong principle, overlooked any material factor, or took into account some wrong material in meting out the sentence herein. [See Dismas Wafula Kilwake v Republic [2018] eKLR].






21.
It is thus clear that the court exercised its discretion in sentencing and, in doing so, meted an appropriate, lawful sentence. However, I note that during sentencing, the trial court did not factor in the period the appellant spent in custody during the trial.






22.
Section 333(2) Criminal Procedure Code which provides that the period of detention before trial should be considered in the sentence






23.
The appellant was arraigned in court on 13th October 2020, and although he was granted bail, he remained in custody until the case's conclusion, having failed to raise the surety.






24.
In the circumstances, I find that in computing the sentence imposed on the appellant, the prison authorities shall consider the period spent in custody by the appellant from 13
th
 October 2020 until the sentencing date






25.
The upshot of the above is that the instant appeal is partially successful. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. The appeal against the sentence is allowed to the extent that the sentence shall take into account the period that the appellant spent in custody during the trial, as stipulated in Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






26.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
This Judgment relates to the memorandum of appeal dated 23
rd
 May, 2022. It is an appeal from the ruling delivered on 11
th
 May 2022 at the Senior Magistrate’s Court at Limuru by Honourable I. F. Koome, Resident Magistrate, in Limuru Senior Resident Magistrate’s Court Civil Case No. E592 of 2021: James Kibichii Yatich vs Directline Assurance Company Limited.






2.
The impugned ruling allowed an application dated 28
th
 January, 2022, which prayed for the striking out of the appellant’s defence and entry of judgment in favour of the respondent herein. The suit (E592 of 2021) is a declaratory suit anchored on a decree issued in Limuru CMCC E393 of 2021 for special damages of Kes. 98,742/= awarded in favour of the respondent and as against the appellant’s insured.






3.
The appeal is based on the grounds that:
1.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by striking out the appellant’s statement of defense and thus denying the appellant a chance to canvass their defence on a full trial.
2.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by striking out the appellant’s statement of defence when the same was not vexatious and scandalous, and raised triable issues in law.
3.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider and appreciate the appellant’s replying affidavit in response to the respondent’s application to strike out the defence.
4.
The learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact in taking a draconian measure by striking out the appellant’s statement of defence when the circumstances did not call for such a measure.
5.
The learned trial magistrate overlooked the appellant’s replying affidavit, and misconstrued the legal principles for striking out pleadings, thereby taking an improper course of striking out the appellant’s statement of defence in the presence of triable issues and analyzing the merits of the case without first hearing the parties.
6.
The learned trial magistrate erred in fact and law in disregarding the provisions of sections 4 and 5 (b) of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle Third Party Risks) Act and the fact that there was a breach of the policy by the respondent for non – payment of policy excess which were pleaded as a defence in the statement of defence, the appellant’s replying affidavit in response to the respondent’s application to strike out the defence.
7.
The learned trial magistrate erred in fact and in law in failing to appreciate or consider the appellant’s submissions.






4.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The appellant filed written submissions dated 15
th
 May, 2024, and the respondent’s submissions are dated 17
th
 May, 2024.






Analysis and Determination:


5.
I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the record of appeal, and the rival submissions by the parties before this court.






6.
The issue for determination can be condensed to one question: whether the trial court erred in striking out the appellant’s statement of defence. In the ruling, the trial court struck out the defence because it is mere denial and does not raise a triable issue. The trial court, in making its decision, relied on Order 2 Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which clothes the court with powers to issue the orders sought. It provides as follows;
“
(1)
At any stage of the proceedings the Court may order to be struck out or amended any pleading on the ground that: -
a.
It discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence in law.
b.
Its scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
c.
It may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
d.
It’s otherwise an abuse of the Court process and may order the suit be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly as the case may be.’’






7.
The object of striking out pleadings is to avoid unnecessary litigation over claims/defences which are bound to fail. It is well settled in law that striking out pleadings is a draconian measure that courts should employ very cautiously and sparingly and only in the clearest of cases.






8.
In the case of Saudi Arabian Airlines Corporation V Premium Petroleum Company Ltd [2014] eKLR the Court of Appeal held that:
“
I need not re-invent the wheel on the subject of striking out a defence. A great number of judicial decisions have now settled the legal principles which should guide the Court in determining whether to strike out a pleading. The power to strike out a suit or defence should be used sparingly and only on the clearest of cases where the impugned pleading is “demurer of something worse than a demurer” beyond redemption and not curable by even an amendment. Thirdly, in case of a defence, the court must be convinced upon looking at the defence, that it is a sham; it raises no bona fide triable issue worth a trial by the court. And a triable issue need not be one which will succeed but one that passes the Shedridan J Test in Patel V E.A. Cargo Handling Services LTD. [1974] E.A. 75 at p. 76 (Duffus P.) that “… a triable issue… is an issue which raises a prima facie defence and which should go to trial for adjudication.” Therefore, on applying the test, a defence which is a sham should be struck out straight away.”






9.
The Respondent`s application was made under the whole of Rule15 (1) (a), and from the reading of the Ruling delivered on 11
th
 May, 2022, the trial court made a finding that the statement of defence was conventional, that it was full of denials and raised no triable issues. This falls under Order 2 Rule 15 (2) which states as follows:
(2)
No evidence shall be admissible on an application under sub-rule (1) (a) but the application shall state concisely the grounds on which it is made.






10.
The above provision envisages that for a court to strike out pleadings under this sub-rule, it should be able to make such a finding from plain reading of the pleadings and without having to call evidence for it.






11.
The question is whether the defence raised bona fide triable issues. In 
National Social Security Fund Board of Trustees v Protection Custody Limited (Civil Appeal E311 of 2021
) [2024] KEHC 2549 (KLR) (12 March 2024) (Judgment), Njagi J. held as follows;
“
The Respondent herein combined prayers where evidence was required to be called with one that does not require evidence to be called. The court seems to have relied on rule 15 (1) (a) to strike out the defence. The trial magistrate in the matter considered the affidavit evidence to hold that the defence did not raise triable issues. The court erred in that respect. The appeal should be allowed for that reason.”






12.
The statement of defence dated 25
th
 January, 2022 denied the claim and raised several issues, among them that the claim in Limuru Civil Case No. E393 of 2021: James Kibichii Yatich vs Moses Njoroge & Another was a material damage claim and which claim is not provided for under Section 4 and 5 (b) of the Insurance Motor Vehicle (Third Party Risk) Act Cap 405b Laws of Kenya. That the claim is not among the claims anticipated and provided for under Sections 4 and 5 (b) of the Insurance Motor Vehicle (Third Party Risk) Act Cap 405 Laws of Kenya and further that the claim was repudiated for non–payment of the policy excess by the insured as such the defendant denies being liable to satisfy any decretal amounts arising out of the alleged policy.






13.
In this case, the respondent argued the grounds cumulatively in the supporting affidavit sworn on 28
th
 January, 2022 and the submissions dated 22
nd
 February, 2022 supporting the application. The finding of the trial court was made under Order 2 Rule 15 (1) (a). The substance of the ruling and the proceedings thereto considered matters of evidence, and the trial court analyzed the case's merits through an application without hearing the parties.






14.
If it were a mere denial, there would be no need to interrogate the defence as the trial court was invited to.






15.
In the case of Giciem Construction Company v Amalgamated Trade & Services LLR No.103 CAK, which was quoted with approval in Job Kilach v Nation Media Group Ltd, Salaba Agencies Ltd & Michael Rono (2015) eKLR it was held:
“
….A triable issue is said to exist if there is a dispute in the facts, which dispute can only be resolved after ventilation in a full hearing. As a general principle, where a defendant shows that he has a fair case for defence or reasonable grounds for setting up a defence or even a fair probability that he has a bona fide defence, he ought to have leave to defend.”






16.
Striking out the statement of defence denies the appellant an opportunity to be heard on the issues raised, which should have gone to trial and interrogation. The trial court failed to properly consider the principles that should guide a court in striking out of pleadings.






17.
The memorandum of appeal raised additional ground for appeal regarding the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 (b) of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle Third Party Risks) Act. The parties also extensively submitted on it; however, since the issue is based on the case's merits, this court will not delve into it.






18.
In light of the foregoing, I find merit in the appeal and reinstate the statement of defence dated 25
th
 January, 2022. The ruling and order dated 11
th
 May, 2022 and the consequential orders are hereby set aside, and the lower court file shall be remitted back to Limuru Chief Magistrates Court for hearing and determination on merit.






19.
The respondent shall bear the costs of this appeal.






20.
It is so ordered.

Peter Muholi, Principal Magistrate on the 15th March 2023.)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant was tried and convicted of the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8 (1) as read with Section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The amended charge sheet has two counts of the offence of defilement. The particulars of the offence in count 1 are that; on 4
th
 March, 2020 at around 16oo hours in [Particulars Withheld], Kiambu County, he caused his genital organ, namely penis, to penetrate into the vagina of VWM, a child aged 7 years. The particulars in count II have the date of 5
th
 March, 2020.






2.
The Appellant also faced alternative counts of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the particulars being that on the aforesaid date and time, he intentionally touched the vagina of VWM, a child aged 7 years.






3.
Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, he filed a petition of appeal on 3
rd
 April, 2023, listing seven (5) grounds of appeal:
“


1.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and facts by failing to observe that my plea of not guilty was thus infringing my right to a fair trial as stipulated in Article 50 of 
the constitution
 of Kenya.






2.
That the learned trial magistrate gravely erred in law and facts by failing to consider and find that there was no warning administered to me regarding a conviction that was rendering my life at stake.






3.
That the learned trial magistrate gravely erred in law and facts in convicting me on a charge which was grossly defective and in available to the extent that the particulars of the charge sheet differ from those of PW1, a crucial witness of the prosecution.






4.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and facts by failing to note that my plea-taking was un-procedural.






5.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and facts by convicting me while failing to observe and find that I was unrepresented, a violation that the trial court took advantage of and commenced a process of trial, yet I had no documented evidence as per Article 25 (c).”








4.
The appeal proceeded through written submissions; only the Appellant filed submissions. In the submissions, the Appellant asked the court to amend the grounds of appeal as follows;
a.
That the learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact by relying on an unestablished element of penetration evidence to convict the Appellant.
b.
That the Learned trial Magistrate erred in law and facts to believe and relied on incredible witnesses PW-1, PW-2, and PW-4 to convict without concrete corroboration forthcoming.
c.
That the sworn defence evidence adduced by the Appellant was improperly rejected given the shoddy investigations conducted; thus, life sentence remains harsh and issued in disregard of mitigating






5.
As a first appellate court, I must reconsider and evaluate the evidence in the court below to arrive at an independent conclusion while bearing in mind that I did not hear or see the witness. In Kiilu & Another V Republic, [2005] 1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal set out the duties of a first appellate court as follows:-
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”






6.
Guided by the above principle, I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the evidence presented before the trial court, and the written submissions filed by the appellant. I have also read the judgment of the trial court. Having done so, I find that the issue for my determination is whether the prosecution established the charges brought against the Appellant to the required standard of proof beyond any reasonable doubt, whether the conviction was safe, and whether the sentence was appropriate or excessive in the circumstances.






8.
The complainant was a child of tender years who gave unsworn evidence. The record shows that the trial court conducted a voire dire examination and recorded it in terms. I am satisfied that the trial court employed the correct procedure in ascertaining the child's competence to give evidence.






9.
The prosecution called 4 witnesses. PW1, the minor, told the court that she was defiled by the Appellant, her father. According to PW1, the incident happened when she got home from school, and no one else except the appellant was at home. She indicated that the Appellant gave her ten shillings after the incident. She reported the incident to her grandmother, who later informed her mother PW2. PW2 told the court that she was married to the Appellant and that he was the stepfather to the minor. According to PW2, the appellant would remain with the minor when she was at work and sleep at a neighbor’s house. PW2 indicated that she interviewed the minor and took her to the police and hospital after the neighbour told her that the child might have been defiled by the Appellant severally. PW3 was the investigating officer, and PW5 was a clinician who examined the minor and prepared the P3 form.






10.
When placed on his defence, the appellant stated that PW2 was his estranged wife and that the charge was a fabrication. DW2 testified that he was with the Appellant on February 3, 2021, at work at Gathanji.






11.
The ingredients that need to be proved in the offence of defilement are;
i.
Age of the victim
ii.
Penetration
iii.
Positive identification of the perpetrator






12.
In Hadson Ali Mwachongo v Republic [2016] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held that:
“
The importance of proving the age of a victim of defilement under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 by cogent evidence cannot be gainsaid. It is not in doubt that the age of the victim is an essential ingredient of the offence of defilement and forms an important part of the charge because the prescribed sentence is dependent on the age of victim. In 
Alfayo Gombe Okello v Republic Cr. App. No. 203 of 2009
 (Kisumu). This Court stated as follows; In its wisdom, Parliament chose to categorize the gravity of that offence on the basis of the age of the victim, and consequently, the age of the victim is a necessary ingredient of the offence which ought to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That must be so because dire consequences flow from proof of the offence under section 8(1).”






13.
The complainant told the court that she was 7 years old. PW2 also told the court that the minor was born on 11
th
 February, 2013 and that she was 7 years old at the time of the incident. PW2 explained that she had misplaced the birth notification and that she had not processed the minor’s birth certificate. An age assessment is acceptable evidence of a subject's age.
According to the age assessment report dated 3
rd
 June, 2020, the complainant was approximately 6 to 7 years old. The age assessment was conducted at the dental department at Githunguri Health Centre three months after the incident. It is a formal document, and I am satisfied that the child's age was established.






14.
The next issue is whether the prosecution proved penetration.
Section 2(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines penetration as: “The partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organ of another person.”
Therefore, penetration, as an essential ingredient of the offence, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.






15.
From the record, the minor used descriptive words to narrate what had transpired;
“
I was in my stocking, dress, and sweater. Peter took me to their room and removed my stocking and pant. He then put his ‘dudu’ for urinating and put it in my ‘dudu.’ He put me on the bed and laid me. He then laid on me and did ‘tabia mbaya’ to me.”
The question is whether this narration amounted to an act of defilement.






16.
In Muganga Chilejo Saha v Republic [2017], eKLR the Court of Appeal analyzed various cases where descriptive terms had been used to narrate sexual abuse.
“
Naturally, children who are victims of sexual abuse are likely to be devastated by the experience, and given their innocence, they may feel shy, embarrassed, and ashamed to relate that experience before people and more so in a courtroom. If the trend in the decided cases is anything to go by, courts in this country have generally accepted the use of euphemisms like, “alinifanyia tabia mbaya” (IE V R, Kapenguria H.C Cr. Case No. 11 of 2016), “he pricked me with a thorn from the front part of this body.”, (Samuel 
Mwangi Kinyati v R, Nanyuki HC.CR.A. NO. 48 of 2015
), “he used his thing for peeing” (David Otieno Alex v R, Homa Bay H.C Cr Ap. No. 44 of 2015), “he inserted his ""dudu"" into my ""mapaja"", (Joses Kaburu v R, Meru H.C Cr. Case No. 196 of 2016), “he used his munyunyu”, (Thomas Alugha Ndegwa, Nbi H.C. Cr. Appeal No. 116 of 2011), as apt description of acts of defilement.”






17.
The descriptive terms were tested in cross-examination in the present case. The minor was consistent. The trial court was satisfied that the reference was to genital organs and that there was penetration. I have reevaluated the evidence, and I am persuaded that, indeed, the minor referred to an act of penetration of her vagina by a penis.






18.
From the evidence, as correctly considered by the trial court, the incident was on 4
th
 March 2020. The examination by PW4 was conducted within 5 days of the occurrence, and some laceration was noted in the genitalia. The prosecution explained to the trial court their challenge in securing the doctor's attendance to produce the medical notes. The appellant has submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn from the prosecution’s failure to call the doctor and produce the medical notes. Medical notes are very important in proving sexual assault, but each case is examined in totality to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. The P3 form was produced in this case, corroborating the minor’s testimony and the mother's. The evidence is sufficient to prove that the minor was defiled.






19.
The next key question is the identity of the perpetrator. The minor told the court that the incident happened at their home and that the only person present was the Appellant. From the evidence, the Appellant is her stepfather and is very well-known to her. The cross-examination did not displace the testimony of where and when the sexual abuse occurred and by whom. The claims of fabrication did not hold water. There was no doubt that the minor properly identified the Appellant as the perpetrator of the sexual assault. The evidence adduced by the prosecution displaces the alibi defence given; DW2 gave testimony of 7
th
 March, which was a different date. The trial court gave reasons for discrediting the defence tendered by the Appellant.






20.
The Appellant has contended in his submissions that the prosecution failed to call the informant whom the minor and PW2 referred to. Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 has provided that a trial court can convict an accused facing a charge of defilement solely on the evidence of the victim if, for reasons to be recorded, the court is satisfied that the victim is telling the truth.






21.
In his petition of appeal, the Appellant indicated that the charge sheet's particulars differed from the minor's testimony. The Investigating officer told the court that the report was made on 10
th
 March 2020, and the minor’s mother (PW2) indicated that she learned of the incident five or so days later. The narration of events by the minor mentioned the school days and was consistent. There was certainty as to the date in reference- 4
th
 March 2020. The prosecution rectified the issue of dates through the amendments to the charge sheet that gave two dates for the occurrence - 4
th
 and 5
th
 March 2020. The charge sheet is not defective.






22.
The totality of the evidence and the P3 form establish the required standard of proof that it was the Appellant who sexually assaulted the minor.






23.
I have examined the lower court record; the Appellant was afforded a fair trial. On the ground that plea-taking was not procedural, I have examined the record and found that the court recorded that the Appellant understood Kiswahili language. His response to the counts and the alternative charges was recorded. The Appellant was also given copies of the witness statements on 26
th
 May, 2020, about six months before the trial commenced on 24
th
 November, 2020. During the trial, he was allowed time to cross-examine the witnesses, to recall witnesses when the charge sheet was amended, and ample time to prepare for his defence and call witnesses.






24.
In the end, I concur with the learned trial magistrate that all the ingredients of the offence in count 1 were proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant was afforded a fair trial, and the conviction was safe. The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.






25.
I will now turn to the sentence. Under Section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to imprisonment for life.






26.
The learned trial magistrate considered the mitigation and called for a pre-sentence report, which was presented on 1
st
 March, 2023. The Supreme Court has now given guidance on minimum sentences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 in Republic V Joshua Gichuki Mwangi Petiti
on No. E018 of  2023
. The court held that where a sentence is set in statute, the legislature has already determined the course unless declared unconstitutional. The trial court meted out a lawful sentence.






27.
Jurisprudence has evolved that life imprisonment is not left indeterminate.
In 
Ayako v Republic (Criminal Appeal 22 of 2018
) [2023] KECA 1563 (KLR) (Okwengu, Omondi & J. Ngugi, JJA) (8
th
 December, 2023) (Judgment) translated life imprisonment to 30 years. They stated as follows:-
“


26.
On our part, considering this comparative jurisprudence and the prevailing socio-economic conditions in Kenya, we come to the considered conclusion that life imprisonment in Kenya does not mean the natural life of the convict. Instead, we now hold, life imprisonment translates to thirty years’ imprisonment.






27.
In the circumstances of this case, given the objective severity of the offence committed by the appellant as analysed above, we hereby allow the appeal on sentence to the extent of ordering that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed shall translate to 30 years’ imprisonment. The record shows that the appellant was in custody since he was arraigned in court on July 18, 2011. By dint of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the imprisonment term of 30 years shall be computed to begin running from that date.”








28.
Considering the evidence and severity of this case, I translate the life imprisonment to 40 years. In compliance with Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the period shall be computed from the date of judgment — 1
st
 March, 2023.






29.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted with the sentence outlined in paragraph 28 of this Judgment.






30.
It is so ordered.

Client










Ruling










1.
This ruling determines two applications; the application dated 31/1/2020 by the advocate for entry of judgment as taxed by the deputy registrar and the application by the client dated 8/5/2024 for stay of proceedings pending appeal. I propose to start with the application for stay since its outcome will have a bearing on the advocate’s application.






Application dated 8/5/2024


2.
The application is brought under Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010, sections 1A, 1B and 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010 and the inherent powers of the Court.






3.
The application seeks orders for a stay of proceedings pending the ruling on the Notice of Motion COA CAPPSUP/E003/2024, Ecobank Kenya Limited v. Macharia Mwangi & Njeru Advocates dated 11/1/2024. It further seeks that the stay of proceedings be extended until the client's intended appeal before the Supreme Court is heard and determined. Additionally, the application asks the court to grant orders for safeguarding the subject matter of the appellant's intended appeal to the Supreme Court.






4.
The application is based on the grounds stated on the face of the Motion and the affidavit of Ms. Caroline Mbenge sworn on 8/5/2024. The client’s case is that the matter involves filing a bill of costs for taxation, charging the client for instruction fees related to debt collection and the realization of securities for a loan amounting to USD 28,232,287.00, under the all-inclusive scale in paragraph 
7
(b), Part II of Schedule 5 of the Advocates Remuneration Order.






5.
That considering that only one demand notice was issued, the taxing master taxed the advocate’s bill under the same scale at Kshs. 43,688,883.40 for instruction fees, which, along with VAT and disbursements, totaled Kshs. 50,689,513/-.






6.
Dissatisfied with this outcome, the client filed a reference, whereby Majanja J overturned the decision, ruling that the advocate was entitled to charge instruction fees under paragraph 
1
, Part II of Schedule 5. The advocate appealed against the ruling and in addressing the issue, the Court of Appeal interpreted section 5, paragraph 
7
(b), focusing on the word ""may,"" and determined that the advocate was entitled to instruction fees solely under paragraph 
7
(b).






7.
Following that decision, the client filed an application on 11/1/2024, seeking a stay of execution of the judgment and certification that the issue raised substantial questions of law of general public importance. This application was expedited and the Court of Appeal scheduled a ruling date for 20/9/2024. Meanwhile, the advocate was actively pursuing enforcement of the Certificate of taxation through a Motion dated 31/1/2020.






8.
The client averred that the ruling on the advocates application was imminent and could be delivered before the Court of Appeal's ruling on the stay of execution, potentially rendering the appeal moot. If the Court of Appeal grants a stay of execution of its judgment, any enforcement orders would be futile.






9.
The application was opposed by the advocate through a replying affidavit dated 3/6/2024, sworn by Elijah Mwangi Njeru. He stated that the client had not been truthful by omitting that the Court of Appeal had determined that the Deputy Registrar had properly taxed the costs. He noted that the client had sought leave from the Court of Appeal to certify that the matter raised issues of general public importance and requested a stay of execution of the judgment, for which a ruling date was reserved.






10.
That however, the Court of Appeal declined the prayer for status quo and stay of execution. That the current application seeks to override that decision by requesting orders that the Court of Appeal had already denied. The advocate argued that the client should have sought a stay of proceedings from the Court of Appeal, the court from which they intend to appeal. Although he acknowledged that the Court has jurisdiction to stay proceedings pending the hearing and determination of an appeal, he contended that under Rule 38(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules, there is no pending appeal unless the client’s application for certification is granted.






11.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions which I have considered. The advocate argued that the client's application for status quo orders had already been declined by the Court of Appeal. That the present application was an attempt to override that Court’s decision. Counsel emphasized that the client should have sought those orders from the Court of Appeal, not this Court. That in the circumstances, the application was an abuse of the court process.






12.
Additionally, the advocate submitted that while the client's application at the Court of Appeal was under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the High Court’s jurisdiction had been exhausted after its decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal. Without jurisdiction, the advocate argued, the application was invalid and could not succeed.






13.
It was contended that the client had not met the threshold for a stay of proceedings and that the advocate would suffer substantial loss and prejudice if the orders were granted. That this Court could only grant a stay in relation to a pending appeal before it, not concerning a pending application for a stay at the Court of Appeal.






14.
In response, the client maintained that the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the advocate’s application, arguing that the absence of specific provisions for the orders sought should not prevent the Court from determining the matter. That the client’s intended appeal was arguable, as was submitted in the Court of Appeal, and that any execution proceedings would undermine the purpose of the intended appeal thereby rendering the proceedings before the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court ineffective. That it stood to lose Kshs 50,689,513.28 if the advocate succeeded in enforcing the






15.
I have considered the application, the response provided and the rival submissions by Learned Counsel. The orders sought in the application are for stay of proceedings pending the delivery of a ruling in the Court of Appeal on an application dated 11/1/2024.






16.
An order for stay of proceedings and stay of execution is governed by order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides that;
“
No appeal or second appeal shall operate as a stay of execution or proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except in so far as the court appealed from may order but, the court appealed from may for sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree or order, and whether the application for such stay shall have been granted or refused by the court appealed from, the court to which such appeal is preferred shall be at liberty, on application being made, to consider such application and to make such order thereon as may to it seem just, and any person aggrieved by an order of stay made by the court from whose decision the appeal is preferred may apply to the appellate court to have such order set aside.”






17.
The principles that a court must consider in an application for stay of proceedings were set out in the case of Global Tours and Travels Limited Nairobi Winding Up Cause No. 43 of 2000 cited in Kenya Power & Lighting Company Ltd vs Esther Wanjiru Wokabi 2014 eKLR. In that case, Ringera J (as he then was) stated as follows: -
“
As I understand the law, whether or not to grant a stay of proceedings or further proceedings on a decree or order appealed from is a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised in the interest of justice.. the sole question is whether it is the interest of justice to order a stay of proceedings and if it is, on what terms it should be granted. In deciding whether to order a stay the court should essentially weigh the pros and cons of granting or not granting the order. And in considering those matters, it should bear in mind such factors as the need for expeditious disposal of cases, the prima facie merits of the intended appeal, in the sense of not whether it will probably succeed or not but whether it is an arguable one, the scarcity and optimum utilization of judicial time and whether the application has been brought expeditiously”.






18.
In Halsbury’s Law of England 4th Edition. Vol. 37 page 330 and 332, it is stated that: -
“
The stay of proceedings is a serious, grave and fundamental interruption in the right that a party has to conduct his litigation towards the trial on the basis of the substantive merits of his case, and therefore the court’s general practice is that a stay of proceedings should not be imposed unless the proceeding beyond all reasonable doubt ought not to be allowed to continue. This is a power which, it has been emphasized, ought to be exercised sparingly, and only in exceptional cases. It will be exercised where the proceedings are shown to be frivolous, vexatious or harassing or to be manifestly groundless or in which there is clearly no cause of action in law or in equity. The applicant for a stay on this ground must show not merely that the plaintiff might not, or probably would not, succeed but that he could not possibly succeed on the basis of the pleading and the facts of the case.”






19.
Those then are the principles and parameters within which this Court is called upon to consider in determining the client’s application.






20.
In this case, the advocate’s bill of costs was taxed by the taxing master at Kshs 50,689,513.28, including VAT and disbursements. The client challenged this decision at the High Court, which overturned the taxing master’s decision. The matter was then taken to the Court of Appeal which upheld the original decision. Dissatisfied, the client has sought to go to the Supreme Court for the determination and what is pending is the application for certification at the Court of Appeal.






21.
In the meantime, the advocate has filed a separate application before this Court for entry of judgment based on the certificate of taxation. This situation has led to the current application, where the client seeks a stay of proceedings pending the Court of Appeal’s ruling on the certification application.






22.
One of the issues that arise in the application is the jurisdiction of the Court to grant the orders sought. The advocate is adamant that, having made a determination on the reference, the Court lacks jurisdiction to handle the application and the same ought to have been filed in the Court of Appeal. That this Court’s jurisdiction in an application for stay of proceedings is only in respect to appeals pending before it.






23.
In the celebrated case of Owners of the Motor Vehicle M.V. Lillians versus Caltex Oil (Kenya) Limited (1989) KLR 1, the Court of Appeal held: -
“
By jurisdiction is meant the authority which a court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by statute, charter or commission under which the court is constituted and may be extended or restricted by the like mean. If no restriction or limit is imposed, the jurisdiction is said to be unlimited. A limitation may be either as to the kind and nature of the action and matters of which the particular court has cognizance of or as to the area over which the jurisdiction shall extend; or it may partake of both these characteristics. If the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunal including an arbitrator depends on the existence of a particular state of facts, the court or tribunal must inquire into the existence of the facts in order to decide whether it has jurisdiction but except where the court or tribunal has been given power to determine conclusively whether the fact exists where a court takes it upon itself to exercise a jurisdiction which it does not possess, its decision a merit to nothing. Jurisdiction must be acquired before judgment. It is for that reason that a question of jurisdiction once raised by a party or by a court on its own motion must be decided forthwith on the evidence before the court. It is immaterial whether the evidence is scanty or limited. Facts constitute the evidence before the court…The moment a court determines that it has no jurisdiction it has to down its tools and proceed no further”






24.
Determining jurisdiction before addressing the merits of an application is crucial because it defines the court's authority and scope. In this case, Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules specifies that a stay of proceedings can only be granted by either the court from which the appeal originates or the court to which the appeal is directed. Given that the appeal is intended to be from the Court of Appeal, the Court’s view is that, it is either the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal that should entertain the stay application.






25.
More-so, it became crystal clear at the hearing of the application, that when the parties were arguing certification application, the client sought the stay from the Court of Appeal, but that Court declined.






26.
In light of the forgoing, this Court finds that it would not be proper to exercise a jurisdiction that does not exist. This determination is based on the fundamental principle that jurisdiction establishes the limits within which a court is empowered to act. As set out above, Order 42 is clear as to when an order of stay is to be made, it is either by the court from where an appeal arises or to the court to which an appeal is made. In the present case, neither of the circumstances exist.






27.
Given the above findings, it is unnecessary to address the merits of the application or evaluate the grounds for granting a stay of proceedings. I find no merit in the application and the same is hereby struck out with costs.








Application dated 31/1/2020


28.
The Motion is brought pursuant to section 51 of the 
Advocates Act
 CAP 16 Laws of Kenya. It seeks that judgment be entered for the sum of Kshs 50,689,513.28 as taxed and certified by the Deputy Registrar. That interest be charged at the rate of 14% per annum from 19/6/2016.






29.
In support of the application, the advocate relied on the grounds on the face of the Motion and the supporting affidavit of ELIJAH MWANGI NJERU.






30.
Under section 51 (2) of the 
Advocates Act
, where a taxing master certifies costs, if the certificate has not been altered or set aside, judgment is to be entered accordingly.






31.
In Lubulellah & Associates Advocates vs N. K. Brothers Limited [2014] eKLR, the court observed that; -
“
The law is very clear that once a taxing master has taxed the costs, issued a Certificate of costs and there is no reference against his ruling or there has been a ruling and a determination made and not set aside and/or altered, no other action would be required from the court save to enter judgment. An applicant is not required to file suit for the recovery of costs.”






32.
The court has the jurisdiction to enter judgment on a certificate of taxation when the retainer is not disputed and when there is no reference. In this case, the client challenged the taxation through a reference which has since been determined. With the reference having been determined, the Certificate of taxation remains valid and has not been set aside. Consequently, nothing is standing in the way of entering judgment as per the certificate of taxation. My finding is that the application has met the conditions set out in section 51 of the 
Advocates Act
.

          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of the Resident Magistrate’s Court at Kiambu by the Honourable S.K. Motari delivered on the 25th day of May 2022 in CMCC NO. 474 OF 2020)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant filed Civil Suit CMCC 475 of 2020 before the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Kiambu seeking damages for injuries sustained when the motor vehicle KAU 675X, in which she was traveling, was involved in an accident with motor vehicle KBY 516Q on 23
rd
 September, 2017 along Ruaka - Kahawa West road.






2.
The Appellant sued the 1
st
 Respondent, the driver of motor vehicle KAU 675X on the date of the accident, and the 2
nd
 Respondent, the registered owner of the motor vehicle. The Respondents did not enter an appearance nor file a defence, and the case proceeded through formal proof.






3.
In the judgment delivered on 25
th
 March, 2022, the trial Court held that the Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof on the issue of liability against the Respondents and dismissed the suit.






4.
The Appellant being aggrieved with the decision, preferred this Appeal on the following grounds: -
i.
That the Honourable Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to have due regard, take into account and appreciate the substantive issues of law and facts raised by the Appellant during the hearing and in the submissions, authorities and other documents on record.
ii.
That Honourable Court Magistrate erred in law and fact by finding that the Appellant failed to prove her case even after she produced a police abstract in her evidence showing who was to blame for the accident forming the substratum of the lower court’s suit.
iii.
That this Honourable Court Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to uphold the best interests of the minors while writing and pronouncing her judgment.
iv.
That in all circumstances of the case, the Honourable Magistrate erred in dismissing the Appellant’s reply to Respondent’s application.
v.
That the Honourable Magistrate erred in law and fact by dismissing the Plaintiff’s case, which was unchallenged by the Defendants.






5.
The Appellant prayed for the following orders: -
(a)
That the Judgment and Order in Kiambu Chief Magistrate’s Court No. 475 of 2020; Teresia Muthoni Versus Shamji Ramji Bhudia & Raman Enterprises delivered on 25
th
 day of March, 2022 be set aside.
(b)
That the Honourable Court award the Plaintiff the prayers sought in Kiambu Chief Magistrate’s Court Case No. 475 of 2020; Teresia Muthoni Versus Shamji Ramji Bhudia & Raman Enterprises.
(c)
Cost of this Appeal be awarded to the Appellant.






6.
The Respondents were served but did not participate in the Appeal. The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.






Analysis and determination:


7.
Being a first Appeal, this Court is bound to re-evaluate the evidence on record and come up with its own findings.
Justice C.W. Githua in Suluenta Kennedy Sita & Another Vs. Jeremiah Ruto (suing as legal representative of the Estate of Joyce Jepkemboi) [2017] Eklr stated as follows: -
“
A first appellant court is enjoined to re-evaluate all the evidence adduced
before the lower court in order to reach its own independent conclusions but in doing so, it should give due allowance to the fact that it did not have the opportunity of seeing or hearing the witnesses.”






8.
The Appellant blamed the Respondents for the accident at the formal proof hearing. She adopted her witness statement as her evidence. She stated that on 23
rd
 September 2017 at around 1600 hours, she was traveling as a passenger in motor vehicle KAU 675X, which was being driven along Ruaka-Kahawa West road or thereabouts when an accident occurred involving the motor vehicle she was traveling in and motor vehicle KBY 516Q.






9.
The appellant said that the motor vehicle KBY 516Q was being driven along the road at high speed when it veered off and caused the accident. The Appellant blamed the 1
st
 Respondent for speeding, as a result of which he lost control of the said motor vehicle. She accused the 1
st
 Respondent of driving carelessly and causing the accident.






10.
In the submissions before this Court, the Appellant has urged the Court to find that she discharged the burden of proof and invited the Court to hold that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor was applicable in her favour.






11.
The issues for determination are as follows: -
(i)
Whether the Appellant discharged the burden of proof that the Respondents were liable for the occurrence of the accident wherein the Appellant was injured.
(ii)
Question of quantum.








Burden of Proof:


12.
The Appellant testified and produced exhibits in Court in support of her claim against the Respondents. That included the following: -
1)
Copy of the Police abstract
2)
Copy of Statutory notice
3)
Demand letter
4)
Motor vehicle search of KBY 516Q
5)
Medical summaries and medical report
6)
P3 Form.






13.
There is proof from the exhibits that an accident occurred on the 23
rd
 of September, 2017, and that the Appellant was injured as a result of the accident. The accident involved motor vehicle KAU 675X and motor vehicle KBY 516Q. The Police abstract captures the 1
st
 Respondent as the driver of the motor vehicle KBY 516Q on the date of the accident. The copy of motor vehicle search records shows that the car is registered in the name of the 2
nd
 Respondent.






14.
in the judgment, the trial Court indicated that the Appellant had not pleaded particulars of negligence against the Respondents in her pleadings. I have read the plaint dated 28th September 2020, and the particulars of negligence have been pleaded in paragraph 
5
.
“
That on or about the 23
rd
 September 2017, the plaintiff was lawfully traveling in motor vehicle registration No. KAU 675X along Ruaka-Kahawa West road or thereabout when the defendant or defendant’s driver/agent and /or servant so negligently drove managed and/or controlled the said motor vehicle registration No. KBY 516Q Tata lorry, that he caused and/or permitted the same to cause the accident, thereby causing the Plaintiff serious injuries.
Particulars of negligence of the Defendants, their driver, servant, employee, and/or agent:
a)
Driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances;
b)
Causing or permitting the said motor vehicle registration number KBY 516Q to cause injuries;
c)
Failing to stop, slow down, swerve, or in any way manage or control the said motor vehicle to avoid the accident;
d)
Failing to maintain any or any proper care and control of the said motor vehicle
e)
Causing the accident.
f)
The Plaintiff will rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor.






15.
The doctrine of res ipsa loquitor is pleaded in paragraph 
5
.






16.
The Appellant was traveling as a passenger in motor vehicle KAU 675X. In her testimony, she did not explain how the accident happened. The trial Court observed that the circumstances relating to the accident were not explained and that the burden of proof on the issue of liability against the Respondents had not been discharged.






17.
Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 provides as follows: -
(1)
Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.
(2)
When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.






18.
The police abstract dated 16
th
 April, 2017 indicated that the accident was pending investigation. This is contrary to what the Appellant submits: that the accident is attributed to the 1
st
 Respondent in the police abstract.






19.
The burden of proof lies on the party asserting the truth of an issue in dispute. This burden doesn’t change even in formal proof hearings, as the party has to adduce evidence sufficient to sustain the suit. Besides, the rules of evidence and procedure must always be observed.
The entry of interlocutory judgment against the Respondents did not absolve the Appellant from the requisite of proving liability. The Appellant’s claim was on negligence and needed to discharge the burden of proof on liability for the claim to succeed. This is as anticipated by Order 10, Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules. It was not enough to merely plead the particulars of negligence. The Appellant particularised the allegations of negligence in the Plaint but did not lead evidence on the same.






20.
Can the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor come to the rescue of the Appellant?
Res ipsa loquitor does not fully reverse the burden of proof and does not have a blanket application on all negligence claims. It is not obvious from the evidence before the Court that the Respondents were liable for the accident. The facts of the accident could have been proved through additional evidence.






21.
The present case was not a single-vehicle accident, and it is not more probable that one driver other than the other was negligent. The Appellant was traveling in another vehicle; negligence cannot be inferred from the Respondents without proof in the evidence that the other was negligent. Based on the set facts presented, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor cannot come to the rescue of the Appellant in this case.






22.
Whereas this case proceeded through formal proof, the onus of adducing and producing evidence that must satisfy the Court rested on the Appellant. The Appellant treated the matter casually because of the interlocutory judgment entered against the Respondents.






23.
The learned magistrate had due regard to issues of law and fact as presented by the appellant. I find no reason to disturb the trial court’s finding on liability.








Quantum:


24.
On quantum, the Appellant submitted that an award of Kshs.200,000/= would be adequate compensation for the injuries outlined as;
a.
Swollen, tender, form-lower lip
b.
Blunt injury (pain and tenderness) – lower jaw front teeth
c.
Blunt injury – right thigh






25.
As a general principle, assessing damages for personal bodily injuries requires exercising court discretion. Still, the said discretion must be exercised judiciously, considering the facts of each case, particularly the injuries sustained and comparable awards previously made for similar injuries.






26.
In assessing damages, the court found that the injuries in the decisions relied upon by the appellant were more severe compared to those sustained in the present case. I have read the authorities in Habiba Abdi Mohammed v Peter Maleve [2000] Eklr, Francis Ochieng & Another v Alice Kajimba [2015] KLR, and I agree with the trial court that the injuries are not comparable to propose a similar assessment. In the case of George Obare v Francisca Tavitha Mbuvi HCCA 89 of 2017, the court upheld an award of Kshs.200,000/= for a cut wound on left ear pinna posteriorly, cut on the right side of the head, long cut on the chest and left cheek, blunt injury to the chest, left leg, right hip joint, and upper back and bruises to the left leg. They are still severe compared to the appellant’s.






27.
The court made reference to two authorities:
Edward Mutevu Maithya & Another v Edwin Nyamweya [2022] eKLR, where
the Respondent had sustained cut wounds on the scalp, and bruises to the back, right upper limb, and left lower limb. The High Court set aside the award on general damages of Ksh.550,000/= and substituted the same with an award of Ksh.100,000/=.
In the case of FM (Minor suing through mother and next friend MWM) v JNM & Another [2020] eKLR, the appellant sustained injuries, namely blunt object injury to the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and limbs. The court awarded Ksh.100,000/= for general damages.






28.
I have read the authorities relied on by the Appellant in the submissions before the lower Court, and I find that the injuries outlined in them are more severe than those outlined by the Appellant. The authorities referred to by the trial Court are more persuasive, and I uphold the assessment of general damages at Kshs.120,000/=. Special damages pleaded and proved were correct to the tune of Kshs.4,820/=. Had the appellant successfully proven liability, the damages awarded by the trial court would be in order.






29.
This Appeal lacks merit and is dismissed with no order as to costs.




It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
This judgment relates to the memorandum of appeal dated 20
th
 May, 2022. It is an appeal from the ruling delivered on 28
th
 April, 2022 by Honourable Mr. W. P. Muholi, Principal Magistrate, in Githunguri Senior Principal Magistrate’s Court Case No. 48 of 2010: In the matter of the Estate of Evans Nyutu Muremwa (Deceased).  It is based on the grounds that:-
i.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by dismissing the appellants’ protest against the weight of the evidence.
ii.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to take into account the appellant’s contention that they never consented to the mode of distribution of Land Parcel No. Githunguri/ Nyaga/ T. 348 by the court.
iii.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to take into account the fact that the appellants’ signatures were forged in the consent to the mode of distribution of the deceased’s estate and/ or properly pronounce himself on the issue of forged signatures.
iv.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to consider and appreciate the fact that the appellants were never involved or were they parties in the protest by the 2
nd
 respondent’s protest against the 1
st
 respondent’s summons for rectification of the grant.
v.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and fact by holding that the court had already pronounced itself on the issue of the protest in which the appellants were not party to.
vi.
The honourable learned magistrate erred in law and fact in disregarding the appellants’ submissions on the issue of res judicata and applying wrong principles of law, that is to say, by failing to consider and take into account the facts presented to the court.
The appellants seek for orders that:
i.
This appeal be allowed.
ii.
The ruling made by the honourable court dismissing the appellants’ protest on 28
th
 April, 2022 be set aside and/ or varied.
iii.
This honourable court do issue its own orders in respect of the facts and evidence in the record of the lower court.
iv.
Costs of this appeal be awarded to the appellants.






2.
The appeal proceeded through written submissions: the appellant's submissions are dated 15
th
 July, 2024 and the first respondent’s submissions are dated 17
th
 May 2024.






Background:


3.
The respondents are the administrators of the deceased’s estate duly appointed pursuant to the grant of letters of administration issued on 12
th
 July 2011. The first respondent is the son, and the second respondent is the widow of the deceased. The appellants are the sons and daughters of the deceased. They are all listed as dependants of the deceased in the petition for letters of administration dated 31
st
 May, 2010.






4.
From the typed proceedings, the court on 22
nd
 March 2012, granted leave to the petitioner to amend the schedule on the property to include L. R. Githunguri/ Nyanga/ T. 438, which was inadvertently excluded from the schedule of properties. The application for confirmation of grant dated 30
th
 January 2012 was subsequently allowed as prayed on 12th April 2012, and further, the property schedule was amended as per paragraph 6 of the further affidavit filed by Mary Mumbi Nyutu, the 2
nd
 Respondent.






5.
Summons for rectification of grant dated 20
th
 February 2013 were thereafter filed by Mary Mumbi Nyutu seeking equal distribution of the deceased’s estate amongst all the beneficiaries and heard by way of viva voce evidence. Joseph Njuguna Nyutu was the only beneficiary opposed to this application, and he filed an affidavit of protest dated 18th March 2013. His main contention was that he opposed the re-subdivision of the deceased’s estate because the deceased had allocated him a portion in 1992 before his death, and he had already constructed on the portion allocated to him.






6.
On 26
th
 June 2013, the court delivered a ruling on the application for rectification of the grant to wit,
“
…The 
law of succession act
 does not allow rectification as errors on mode of distribution of deceased’s estate in confirmed grant. The errors correctable vide Section 24 of the Act have been stated. In this ruling, the findings of this court are that the summons for rectification of grant dated 20
th
 February, 2013 is not merited. The grounds adduced therein are not supported by the 
law of succession act
 and therefore I will dismiss it with costs. The certificate of confirmation of grant dated 17
th
 April, 2012 shall remain as it is. Orders accordingly.”






7.
The affidavit of protest dated 2
nd
 March, 2021 and filed by all the beneficiaries except Joseph Njuguna Nyutu was thereafter filed. Its ruling, delivered on 28
th
 April, 2022, is the subject of the instant appeal.








Analysis and Determination:


8.
I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the record of appeal, and the rival submissions by the parties before this court.






9.
In 
Mursal & another vs. Manese (suing as the legal administrator of Dalphine Kanini Manesa) (Civil Appeal E20 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 282 (KLR) (6 April 2022) (Judgment) the court stated as follows:
“
2.
A first appellate court is mandated to re-evaluate the evidence before the trial court as well as the judgment and arrive at its own independent judgment on whether or not to allow the appeal. A first appellate court is empowered to subject the whole of the evidence to a fresh and exhaustive scrutiny and make conclusions about it, bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses first hand. This duty was stated in Selle & another v Associated Motor Boat Co. Ltd.& others{{^}} and in Peters v Sunday Post Limited.”






10.
The impugned ruling decided as follows:
“
… It is therefore my finding after careful analysis that the affidavit of protest is not merited for two reasons that it has been filed late in the day and secondly, that the court has already pronounced itself for the same. It is therefore dismissed. Each party to bear their own cost.”






11.
The issues for determination are;
i.
Whether the affidavit of protest was properly before the court
ii.
Whether the issue raised in the affidavit of protest is res-judicata






12.
The parties herein have been embroiled in a succession dispute that has lasted about 14 years. The back and forth has been around distribution. There is a valid grant and certificate of confirmation of grant that has never been revoked or annulled. The ruling of 26th June 2013 dismissed the application on the ground that the orders sought in the summons for rectification of grant could not be obtained through rectification. The ruling of 28
th
 April 2022 also found that the affidavit of protest could not be entertained as it was related to distribution, yet coming in late in the day after the avenue to engage it has been closed via the certificate of confirmation of grant on record.






13.
The 
Law of Succession Act
 is a specialized piece of legislation complete with its own rules of procedure. The Act regulates all proceedings and provides for procedures to be followed. The process and procedures in probate and administration cases are crucial because of the expected outcomes of each stage. Once set in motion, the petitioners/administrators are expected to involve all interested parties, and they, in return, are expected to participate and be keen to ensure that their interests are well taken care of and that there is no miscarriage of justice.






14.
Under Rule 41 of the Probate and Administration Rules, written protests are heard during the hearing of the application for confirmation. The appellants filed their affidavit of protest dated 2
nd
 March 2021 against the already confirmed grant. I agree with the trial court's findings that the Affidavit of Protest was not lodged within the period stipulated in the Probate and Administration Rules.






15.
When the summons dated 20
th
 February 2013 came up in court on 18
th
 March 2013, the appellants and the respondents were all present and the subject matter still revolved around the parcel Githunguri/Nyaga/T.438. The Grant had already been confirmed then, and the parcel had been included in the schedule. Whereas the appellants were not part of the witnesses who testified, they are recorded as present and expected, thus, they understood the proceedings and may have opted to have their interests taken care of by one of the parties to the application. They supported the 2
nd
 respondent’s application, which was disallowed. The file was inactive until the protest was filed in 2021. The delay is not explained.






16.
In my view, the introduction of the protest was one more way of bringing the issue back to court through a new process. Whereas concluded probate cases can be reactivated, parties should strive to abide by the provisions of the 
Law of Succession Act
 and the Probate and Administration Rules. It is best to address the issues in the required procedure and expeditiously without prolonged litigation.






17.
The rulings of 26 June, 2013 and 28 April, 2022 both found that the application and protest, respectively, had been brought under the wrong provisions of the law and that the orders sought could not be obtained from the pleadings as presented. This was in order.






18.
As the issue raised by the appellants in the protest dated 2nd March 2021 is that the administrators/respondents distributed an additional property (Githunguri/Nyaga/T.438) without their knowledge. The additional property was apportioned to the administrators only, in the ratio contained in the amended Certificate of Confirmation of Grant dated 7
th
 October 2014. If the grounds advanced in the protest are that the grant was obtained fraudulently by making a false statement or concealing something material to the case or by means of an untrue allegation of a fact, then they should have moved the court pursuant to Section 76 of the 
Law of Succession Act
.






19.
The upshot of the above is that the instant appeal is not merited and is dismissed.






20.
Each party will bear its own costs.






21.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
This is an appeal arising from the Betting Control & Licensing board delivered on 31/7/2023. The appellant made a complaint to the Betting Control and Licensing Board (“the Board”) against the respondent (“Betika Company”) for failing to award her the winnings made from the magic numbers game.






2.
On 31/7/2023, the Board rendered its decision whereby it held that the Betika Company should pay the appellant a maximum of Kshs. 1,000,000/-. This amount was stipulated in the Terms and Conditions as the maximum payout for the Magic Numbers game.






3.
Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant preferred this appeal vide a memorandum of appeal dated 21/8/2023. The appeal was founded on 9 grounds which can be summarized as follows: -
a.
That the Board erred by not directing Betika Company to pay the full amount of Kshs. 99,976,365/-, which represented the appellant’s total winnings.
b.
That the Board made an error by capping the interest at Kshs. 1,000,000/- an amount not mentioned by any of the parties.
c.
That the Board erred in taking the manufacturers position that the game identified and confirmed a system problem referred to as an internal bug.
d.
That the Board erred in law and fact in failing to find the Betika Company accountable for withholding the appellant’s winnings for almost two years.






4.
The appellant therefore prayed for the appeal to be allowed and the Betika Company to be found liable to pay Kshs 99,979,365.61 together with interest at prevailing commercial and bank rates.






5.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions. The appellant submitted that while the respondent accused her of exploiting the game, it did not specify how her actions were exploitative or how they affected the game or website. Additionally, the appellant submitted that the respondent failed to identify the relevant terms and conditions applicable at the time of the appellant’s winnings.






6.
It was the appellant further submissions that the in its letter dated 23/2/2023, the Board found no fault with her winnings and did not support the respondent’s claims. That freezing the appellant’s account and withholding her winnings violated her right to fair administrative action under Article 47 of 
the Constitution
. She also challenged the impartiality of the game developers, Split the Pot AB, regarding their claim of a critical bug, citing lack of evidence on when the bug occurred.






7.
In conclusion, the appellant submitted that the Board incorrectly relied on terms and conditions about maximum winnings that were not in effect during the appellant’s game on January 2nd and 3rd, 2022, suggesting these terms were introduced during the dispute.






8.
On its part, the respondent submitted that the Board did not err in failing to direct the payment of Kshs. 99,979,365.61, as the decision was consistent with the terms and conditions of the game which capped the maximum payout at Kshs. 1,000,000/-. That according to those terms, if the system generated winnings exceeding the maximum amount, any excess is considered void and not payable.






9.
The respondent further submitted that a report from the manufacturer of the game ""Magic Numbers"" revealed that the multiplier was incorrectly calculated due to a flaw in the game logic, leading to an unusually high multiplier. That the bets followed similar patterns and settings, with betting amounts increasing significantly in a short period, despite the initial account balances being relatively low.






10.
That the appellant used the same device and browser, placing bets within a 9-hour window. That in the premises, to pay the appellant Kshs 99,979,365.61 would result in unjust enrichment, as the excessive winnings stemmed from a critical system bug. It was emphasized that there was a valid contract between the appellant and the respondent, governed by terms and conditions that the appellant had accepted, and that the game manufacturer had the best understanding of the game’s internal mechanics. That in the premises, the appeal should be dismissed.






11.
The Court has considered the record and the submissions of the parties. This an appeal from the decision of the Board dated 31/7/2023. In its decision, the Board acknowledged that the appellant had accumulated winnings totaling Kshs 99,976,365.61. It that the respondent had unfairly frozen the appellant's gaming account. Additionally, the Board acknowledged the Terms and Conditions for the group games, which specified a maximum payout of Kshs. 1,000,000/-. Consequently, the Board awarded the appellant this maximum amount as stipulated in the terms and conditions.






12.
In arguing her case, the appellant argued that the board had relied on terms and conditions that were not in effect at the time she accrued her winnings. She contended that these terms and conditions had been unfairly introduced by the respondent and that she was not given an opportunity to respond to this new evidence. In response, the respondent maintained that any winnings exceeding the maximum limit of Kshs. 1,000,000/- were null and void and that the respondent was not obligated to pay any amount beyond this allowable limit.






13.
In view of the facts laid out by the parties in this appeal and the grounds of appeal set out above, the main issue for determination is whether there was an error on the part of the Board in relying on the terms and conditions which gave out the maximum limit of Kshs 1,000,000/-.






14.
In terms of Selle v Associates Motor Boat & Co [1968] EA 123), this Court has a duty to re-examine and subject the whole of the evidence to a fresh and exhaustive scrutiny, drawing its own conclusions from that analysis and bearing in mind that it did not have an opportunity to see the witnesses testify.






15.
In this case, the relationship between the parties is contractual in that the betting company has an obligation of honoring the terms of the contract by paying out winnings as specified as well as maintaining the integrity of the whole process and laying out the rules of the game. The client/customer on the other hand, is obligated to comply with the terms and conditions and ensuring timely deposits. For this process to run smoothly, there the rules are set up in the terms and conditions of the game.






16.
The appellant submitted that the terms and conditions relied on were not present at the time she played the game. It is imperative to note that, the decision of the Board was wholly based on the said terms and conditions. They seem to have been submitted twice by the respondent to the Board in the respondent’s letters dated 2/3/2023 and 14/7/2023, respectively. They appeared as ANNEXTURE 5 in the letter dated 14/7/2023.






17.
In its letter to the appellant’s advocate dated 26/9/2023, the Board supplied the said advocates with all the documents relied on by the Board. The said 2 letters and their enclosures were also included. The letter set out in detail what each document was and the Board disclosed that the subject letters and the annextures thereto which included the terms and conditions of the game.






18.
However, upon perusal of the entire Record and the supplementary records of appeal, neither the appellant nor the respondent supplied that vital document. The appellant very well knew that her appeal was as against the relienace by the Board on those terms and conditions. Why did she leave that crucial document out in her Record of Appeal? That is a document which the Board specifically referred to and stated that it relied on PART D thereof to cap the winnings at a maximum of Kshs.1,000,000/-.






19.
The question that arises is, can this Court interfere with a finding of fact based on a document that was before the Board which the Board specifically referred to, supplied the same to the appellant but the appellant conveniently shielded this Court from seeing? I do not think so. In the view of this Court, by failing to produce the said crucial document in the appeal before this Court, the appellant denied this Court the chance of testing the veracity of the Board’s decision. Submitting that the terms and conditions were not there at the time of playing is not enough.






20.
The burden of proof is on the person who alleges the existence of the set of circumstances he wishes the Court to believe. In the present case, the appellant’s case is that the Board was wrong in relying on terms and conditions that were not in existence at the time she placed her wager. She failed to produce those terms and conditions so that the Court can test them and the veracity of her claim. See sections 107, 108 and 112 of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya.






21.
To the extent that those terms and conditions were produced before the Board and the Board not only referred to them but relied on them in arriving at its decision, but they were conveniently left out of this appeal, this Court cannot pronounce itself on them and neither can it disturb the Board’s decision on them.






22.
On the third ground of appeal as outlined by the court, the appellant contested the Board's finding that the game's manufacturer identified and confirmed a system issue referred to as an internal bug. The Contingencies Functionality report for Split the Pot AB indicated that the system met the relevant requirements according to the test plan. The incident report dated 3/1/2022 mentioned irregularities in the system, which led the respondent to deactivate the affected accounts.






23.
This evidence remains uncontested, as the appellant merely questioned the objectivity of the respondent’s manufacturer without providing contrary evidence. As a result, the burden shifted to the appellant to present opposing evidence. In failing to do so, the Court is inclined to believe that an error did occur and agrees with the Board’s findings.






24.
The outcome of this is that, while there is no evidence showing that the terms and conditions were in place to bind the appellant to the Kshs. 1,000,000/- maximum payout, the evidence on record suggests that a system issue may have led to unusually high payments. Therefore, while the court recognizes the appellant's right to compensation, it would constitute unjust enrichment for her to benefit from winnings generated by a faulty system.






25.
The upshot of this is that the appeal has no merit and is hereby dismissed with costs.
It is so decreed.

Ruling










1.
Before me is an application dated 24/7/2023. The same is brought under sections 1A, 1B and 3B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 45 rules 1&2, Order 51 rule 1 of the Civil Procedure rules 2010. It seeks the review of the orders of the Court made on 22/5/2023 by which it was ordered that a sum of Kshs. 45,000,000/- be released to the firm of Nyasani E.N & Co Advocates for and on behalf of the plaintiff.






2.
In support of the application, the applicant relied on the grounds set out on the face thereof and the supporting affidavit sworn by DONALD.B. KIPKORIR on 24/7/2023. It was contended that at the time the orders of the court were issued on 22/5/2023, there was an application on record challenging the plaintiff’s legal representation.






3.
It was posited that Kshs. 50,000,000/- held in a joint interest earning account was pursuant to a court order given on 4/2/2016. That the applicant had filed a notice of appeal against the judgment and decree of the Court and had been unable to proceed with the appeal since the court file was being reconstructed. That the orders granted on 22/5/2023 were prejudicial to the hearing of the intended appeal as it would render it nugatory. That this was a proper case for review and the application was timeously filed.






4.
In response to the application, the respondent filed a replying affidavit sworn by SAMEET PATEL on 28/8/2023. It was deponed that, at the time the Court issued the orders of 22/5/2023, the applicant was represented by a competent advocate who did not object to the request for release of the security deposit. That the application was filed two months after the order for the release of funds suggesting it was an afterthought.






5.
It was further contended that the application did not disclose any grounds for review. The respondent also claimed that as a result of the delay in prosecuting the appeal, the respondent had been subjected to prejudice as it has been 8 years since the judgment was delivered.






6.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions which I have considered. The applicant submitted that the orders of 22/5/2023 had been made without any formal application to set aside the orders of the Court dated 4/2/16. That release of the monies to the firm of Nyasani E.N& Co Advocates was a mistake or error apparent on the face of record since there was an issue of representation involving the firms of Nyasani E.N& Co Advocates and Stanley Henry Advocates. It was submitted that the release of the funds would greatly prejudice the applicant as the respondent was unlikely to refund the decretal sum.






7.
On the part of the respondent, it was submitted that the application was intended to delay the respondent from enjoying the benefits of the judgment, which had been delivered on18/11/2014. The respondent's counsel pointed out that the case file had been reconstructed by orders of Justice Kasango, contradicting the applicant's claim. That the applicant's assertion that the orders were issued without a formal application could be a ground for appeal rather than review as the applicant was essentially challenging the Court's decision.






8.
I have considered the pleadings, the submissions as well as the authorities cited. The core issue is whether there has been established a proper case for review.






9.
The Court’s jurisdiction for review stems from section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The rule provides: -
“
(1)
Any person considering himself aggrieved—
(a)
by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred; or
(b)
by a decree or order from which no appeal is hereby allowed, and who from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree or order, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay.
(2)
A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when, being respondent, he can present to the appellate court the case on which he applies for the review”.






10.
The present application seeks the review of the orders of the Court made on 22/5/2023. The order directed the release of Kshs. 45,000,000/- together with interest to the firm of Nyasani E.N & Co Advocates. The applicant argued that there was an error apparent on the face of record since the orders were granted without a formal application and that there was a question before the Court on legal representation of the respondent’s advocates.






11.
In response, the respondent argued that the applicant was essentially challenging the judge's orders, and therefore, the appropriate course of action would be to file an appeal rather than seek a review.






12.
The application is based on the ground that there was need for review as there was an error apparent on the face of record. In Muyodi v Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation & another [2006] 1 EA 243, the Court of Appeal described an error apparent on the face of the record as follows: -
“
… In Nyamogo & Nyamogo v Kogo (2001) EA 174 this Court said that an error apparent on the face of the record cannot be defined precisely or exhaustively, there being an element of indefiniteness inherent in its very nature, and it must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case. There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of record. Where an error on a substantial point of law stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two opinions, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out. An error which has to be established by long drawn process of reasoning or on points where there may conceivably be two opinions, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Again, if a view adopted by the court in the original record is a possible one, it cannot be an error or wrong view is certainly no ground for a review although it may be for an appeal. This laid down principle of law is indeed applicable in the matter before us.”






13.
In view of the foregoing, for an application for review to succeed on the ground that there is an error apparent on the face of record, it should be demonstrated that there was a clear and obvious mistake that appears directly in the court record or judgment. The mistake need no extensive analysis or re-examination of the entire face or the record such as a misapplication of the law, a clerical error, or a failure to consider a key piece of evidence or a legal principle.






14.
In the present case, two issues were raised that is, the absence of a formal application and the ongoing dispute over the respondent's legal representation. Upon careful consideration of the record, the Court notes that, on the material day, there was only exchange between the advocates representing the respondent.






15.
The Court was made to believe that what was in dispute was the representation for the respondent, as to who between the Law Firms of Stanley Henry Advocates and Nyasani EN Advocates should be appearing for the respondent and therefore liable to receive the amount deposited in Court. The Court did not give the applicant’s advocate an opportunity to address it on the matter.






16.
This is so because all that seemed to simmer, was the bills of costs belonging to the firm of Stanley Henry Advocates amounting to slightly over Kshs. 4million that were in dispute. That is why the Court ordered the balance of Kshs.45million be released to the advocates who were coming on record for the respondent. The Court was not aware that the amount was so deposited in Court as security for stay pending appeal. That was never brought to the attention of the Court. Obviously, if it was, the Court would have sought the views of the applicant’s advocates. The order was obviously made in error.






17.
Accordingly, I find that the application is meritorious and I allow the same. I will not make any order as to costs.
It is so ordered.

N THE MATTER OF ADOPTION OF BABY KA aka PAN (BY FWW)






In the matter of




FWW


 


Applicant










Judgment










1.
Before this Court is the application dated 17
th
 November, 2023. The Applicant FWW is seeking to be authorized to adopt Baby KA aka PAN, hereinafter referred to as the child. Upon adoption, the child is to be known as KWWB. FWW will be appointed as the child’s legal guardian upon the granting of the adoption orders.






2.
The Applicant is a single woman whose marriage broke down due to her inability to conceive. She is a Kenyan citizen, as evidenced by a copy of her Kenyan National Identity Card. FWW is self-employed, and her financial capability and ability to provide for the child is evidenced by her bank statement. The applicant's health status is good, as evidenced by her medical reports dated 13
th
 October, 2020, and she does not have any previous criminal records, as evidenced by her certificate of Good Conduct issued by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. She has indicated her desire to adopt the child by virtue of her broken marriage due to her inability to conceive. The applicant desires to help needy children grow in a Godly manner and to grow her family.






3.
The report from the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection State Department for Social Protection and Senior Citizen Affairs – Directorate of Children’s Services (Nairobi County) dated 24
th
 April, 2024 indicates that the child is a girl, 3 years 8 months old. She is Kenyan, whose biological mother abandoned her after birth at Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya. The child was declared free for adoption on 27
th
 January, 2023 by Change Trust (CT) vide freeing Certificate Serial Number 00615.






4.
There is a consistent message that there is the urge for FWW to have a child of her own and her motivation to provide for an abandoned child.






5.
The child is a Kenyan citizen under Article 14 (1), which provides that a person is a citizen by birth if on the day of the person’s birth, whether or not the person is born in Kenya, either the mother or father of the person is a citizen.






6.
In light of the best interests of the child principle provided for under Article 53 (2) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010. Sections 8 (1), (2), and (3) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
 and the 1
st
 Schedule of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
, this Court must prioritize the child’s best interests in making decisions touching on her.
a.
Article 53 of 
the Constitution
, 2010 states that a child’s best interests are paramount in every matter concerning the child.
b.
Sections 8 (1), (2) and (3) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
 provides as follows;
1.
In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public of private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies:
a.
The best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration;
b.
The best interests of the child shall include, but shall not be limited to the considerations set out in the First Schedule.
2.
All judicial and administrative institutions, and all persons acting in the name of such institutions, when exercising any powers conferred under this Act or any other written law, shall treat the interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration to the extent that this is consistent with adopting a course of action calculated to: -
a.
safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of the child;
b.
conserve and promote the welfare of the child; and
c.
secure for the child such guidance and correction as is necessary for the welfare of the child, and in public interest.
3.
In any matters affecting a child, the child shall be accorded an opportunity to express their opinion, and that opinion shall be taken into account in appropriate cases, having regard to the child’s age and degree of maturity.
c.
The First Schedule, as provided for under Section 8 (1) of the Children’s 
Act No. 29 of 2022
, provides best interests considerations to be as follows:
1.
The age, maturity, stage of development, gender, background and any other relevant characteristics of the child.
2.
Distinct special needs (if any) arising from chronic ailment or disability.
3.
The relationship of the child with the child’s parent (s) and/ or guardian (s) and any other persons who may significantly affect the child’s welfare.
4.
The preference of the child, if old enough to express a meaningful preference.
5.
The duration and adequacy of the child’s current living arrangements and the desirability of maintaining continuity.
6.
The stability of any proposed living arrangements for the child.
7.
The motivation of the parties involved and their capacities to give the child love, affection, and guidance.
8.
The child’s adjustment to the child’s present home, school, and community.
9.
The capacity of each parent or guardian to allow and encourage frequent and continuing contact between the child and the other parent and/ or guardian (s), including physical access.
10.
The capacity of each parent and/ or guardian (s) to cooperate or to learn to cooperate in child care.
11.
Methods for assisting parental and/ or guardian cooperation and resolving disputes and each parent’s/ guardian’s willingness to use those methods.
12.
The effect of the child if one parent/ guardian has sole authority over the child’s upbringing.
13.
The existence of domestic abuse between the parents/ guardian (s), in the past or currently, and how that abuse affects the emotional stability and physical safety of the child.
14.
The existence of any history of child abuse by a parent and/ or guardian (s); or anyone residing in the same dwelling as the child.
15.
Where the child is under one year of age, whether the child is being breast-fed.
16.
The existence of a parent’s (s) or guardian’s (s) conviction for a sex offense or a sexually violent offense under the 
Sexual Offences Act
.
17.
Where there is a person residing with a parent or guardian, whether that person; -
a.
Has been convicted of a crime under this Act, the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the Penal Code, or any other legislation.
b.
Has been adjudicated of a juvenile offence which, if the person had been an adult at the time of the offence, the person would have been convicted of a felony.
18.
Any other factor which may have a direct or indirect effect on the physical and psychological well -being of the child.






7.
The report from the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection State Department for Social Protection and Senior Citizen Affairs – Department of Children’s Services (Nairobi County), the report from Buckner Kenya Adoption Services (BKAS) Adoption Society, the guardian ad litem and the proposed legal guardians indicate that the child is well known to the adoptive parents and that he will be well taken care of in their care and custody.






8.
I find that this adoption gives the child a chance at a better life and education in a loving and stable home with the adoptive parents.






9.
In the circumstances, I allow the originating summons dated 17
th
 November 2024 and make the following orders:
a.
The Applicant FWW is authorized to adopt the child known as KA, aka PAN.
b.
Upon adoption, the child shall be known as KWWB.
c.
The child is declared a Kenyan citizen by birth and is entitled to all rights and benefits under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, and all applicable laws.
d.
FWW is appointed as the child's legal guardian.
e.
The Registrar General is directed to make the relevant entries in the Adopted Children’s Register in respect of the child.
f.
The Registrar of Births and Deaths is directed to issue a birth certificate in respect of the child’s new name.






10.
It is so ordered.

Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, and the Authority is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, receipting and accounting for all tax revenues as an agency of the Government of Kenya, and the administration and enforcement of the statutes set out under the schedule to the Act.






3.
The Respondent vide a letter dated 29

rd
 June, 2023.






5.
The Respondent on 18

7.
The Appellant aggrieved by the Respondent‘s review decision lodged a Notice of Appeal to the Tribunal dated 30
th
 August, 2023 and filed on 1
st
 September, 2023.






8.
After a series of meetings at the Alternative Dispute Resolution forum (ADR), the parties reached an ADR agreement and thereafter a Partial Consent was filed at the Tribunal dated 14

th
 April, 2024. The ADR process did not resolve the matter of classification of seven (7) products whose additional taxes amounted to Kshs. 5,888,331.00 which is the subject of the instant Appeal.








The Appeal


9.
The Appellant filed its Memorandum of Appeal on the 15
th
 September, 2023 and set out the following grounds of Appeal;
a.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by applying a non-existent law that imposes a duty rate of 10% on premixes used in the manufacture of animal and poultry feeds.
b.
That the Respondent erred in law by acting ultra-vires of its Constitutional and statutory mandate by failing to enforce the clear provisions of the law and imposing a chemical component to coerce the Appellant in paying taxes.
c.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in finding that the Appellant's products fell under HS Code 2309.90.90, despite the fact that the products do not fit within the Heading, Sections and Explanatory Notes of the previously mentioned classification.
d.
That the Respondent erred in fact and in law by failing to take into account the product data sheets, to infer the correct product description and function of the Appellant’s products, which would lead to a correct classification.
e.
That the Respondent erred in law by failing to apply correctly the General Interpretation Rules for the Classification of Goods (""GIR""). The Respondent, specifically contravened the Rules by;-
i.
Failing to examine the applicability of the language used in particular the term 'premix' under sub-heading 2309.90.10 as with regard to the Appellant’s imports;
f.
That the Respondent breached the Appellant's right to legitimate expectation by declaring that one of the products subject to the appeal falls under tariff code 23.90.10 and at the same time seeking to enforce a tax liability on the very same product under a different tariff, 23.90.90.
g.
That further the Respondent erred in fact and in law by seeking to enforce a tax liability of Kshs. 1,478,707.00, whose objection had succeeded by dint of the operation of the law.
h.
That the Respondent, by virtue of being an administrative body, failed to give due regard to the Appellant's responses and information before issuing the review decision.
i.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact by levying an illegal and unconstitutional demand of Kshs. 9,222,845.00 based on an illegality.

The Appellant’s witness statement of David Murumba Mukongolo dated 2
nd
 March, 2024 and filed on 28
th
 March, 2023; admitted in evidence under oath on the 15
th
 May, 2024
d.
The Appellant’s witness statement of Benson Otieno dated 27
th
 February, 2024 and filed on 28
th
 March, 2023; admitted in evidence under oath on the 15
th
 May, 2024.






11.
That on 19
th
 July, 2022, the Respondent issued the Appellant a demand notice of Kshs. 1,478,707.00. This demand was based on the grounds that the Appellant had instances of wrong tariff classification.






12.
That the Appellant objected to the above demand through an objection dated 5
th
 August, 2022. That the Appellant extensively explained why the particular products Mialick lactation and Mialick fattening fell under Chapter 23 as opposed to Chapter 25.






13.
That in contravention of the statutory timelines, the Respondent failed to issue an objection decision to the Appellant's objection. That therefore, by dint of operation of the law, the objection succeeded.






14.
That on 25
th
 May, 2023, the Respondent issued an advance ruling for Sigma Bravo Premix where it classified it under Heading 23.90.90.






15.
That subsequently, the Respondent issued a demand notice on 29
th
 May, 2023, pursuant to a post clearance audit for the period 2018 to May 2023. The demanded amount of Kshs. 9,222, 845.00 was based on the following facts:-
i.
The product, Miavit Egg Yolk Colorant is specified to be an organic compound with chemical properties that contains calcium carbonate as a carrier.
ii.
The products Sigma Bravo Premix and Belmill Layer Basemix specified to be feed preparations containing relatively significant levels of protein and crude ash, are designed to supplement basic farm produced feeds with protein content in addition to other organic/inorganic substances.
iii.
The products Miavit Egg Yolk Colorant were considered as a feed additive intended for egg laying hens, should be classified under tariff code 2309.90.90.
iv.
Other products: Miavit Sigma Bravo Premix, Belmill layer Basemix, Avatec 150 G, Mialick Fattening, Miaphos and Robenz 66G, ought to also be declared under 2309.90.90, which attracts an additional tax of 10%.






16.
That aggrieved, the Appellant through its tax agents, filed an objection dated 23
rd
 June, 2023, relying on data sheets availed. That the grounds set out were as below;
a.
Premix Belmill Layer Basemix contains calcium carbonate, monocalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate which are minerals. This to the Appellant, is a premix used in poultry feed under tariff code 23.90.10.
b.
Sigma Bravo Premix contains calcium carbonate, brewers' grains, yeasts, brewers' yeast, poultry protein, liver hydrolysate (poultry), glucosamine (chitosamine), chondroitin sulphate, sodium chloride. To the Appellant, this product is a premix used as a poultry feed under tariff code 23.90.10
c.
Miaphos contains calcium, phosphorous, sodium, magnesium, copper, manganese and zinc which are vitamin additives. As this product is added to drinking water of poultry, the Appellant maintained that the same falls under tariff code 23.90.10.
d.
Egg Yolk Colorant premix contains canthaxanthin, ethyl ester and calcium carbonate which are mineral additives. The data sheet recommended that the does of the product should be 0.1% in a complete feed of laying hens.
e.
Avatec 150G, Mialick fattening and Ribenz 66G contains minerals to be added to the feed.
f.
All the products above are added to the compound feed at levels between 0.1%-0.5%. Consequently, they cannot supplement the feed content in the compound.
g.
The products are therefore not aimed to supplement the feed.






17.
That the Respondent, on 18
th
 July 2023, issued its review decision, where it maintained that the Appellant's products highlighted above, ought to have been declared under tariff code 2309.90.90 'other' attracting a 10% duty, as opposed to the Appellant's declaration of 2309.90.10 “premixes used in the manufacture of animal and poultry feeds” which is zero rated (0 %).






18.
That on 26
th
 July, 2023, contrary to its own review decision, the Respondent through a letter referenced; 'Review of classification for premix Belmill Layer Basemix; M/S Miavit Limited' revoked the classification of premix Belmill layer Basemix from 23.90.90 and confirmed that the correct tariff was 23.90.10.






19.
That the above letter confirmed that indeed the Appellant’s products are premixes that should fall under tariff code 23.90.10, which is the position of this Appeal.






20.
That despite the Respondent formally accepting that the Appellant's products fall under tariff code 23.90.10, it proceeded to classify the products under tariff code 23.90.90, to coerce the Appellant to pay a tax of Kshs.9,222,845.00.






21.
That this Appeal is based on Chapter 23 of the East African Community Harmonised Commodity description and coding system; in particular tariff sub-heading 2309.90.10 and 2309.90.90.






22.
It was the Appellant's position that its products fall under tariff code 23.90.10. Further, that there is no law that imposes 10% duty on premixes used in manufacturing animal and poultry feeds.






23.
That Chapter 23 of the Harmonised Commodity description and coding system refers to animal feeding and a fair reading of the same expressly dictates that any premix that is used in the manufacture of animal or poultry feeds falls under tariff code 2309.90.10.






24.
That in addition to the above, the World Customs Organization (WCO) the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (2022) describes a 'premix' as below:
“
Compound or compositions consisting of a number of substances (sometimes called additives) the nature or proportion which vary according to the animal production required. These substances are of three types:-


1.
Those which improve digestion and, more generally, ensure that the animal makes good use of the feeds and safeguard its health; vitamins or provitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, coccidiostats, trace elements, emulsifiers, flavourings and appetisers, etc.






2.
Those designed to preserve the feeding stuffs (particularly fatty components) until consumption by the animal; stabilizers, anti-oxidants etc.






3.
Those which serve as carriers and which may consist either one or more organic nutritive substances (manioc or soya flour or meal, middlings, yeast, various residues of the food industries etc) or inorganic substances e.g. (magnestic, chalk, kaolin, salt, phosphates)
The concentration of substances described in (1) above and the nature of the carrier are determined so as to ensure, in particular, homogenous dispersion and mixing of these substances in the compound feeds to which the preparations are added.
Provided they are of a kind used in animal feeding, this group also include;-
a)
Preparations consisting of several mineral substances;”








25.
That to correctly apply the above legal provisions, the Appellant submitted the chemical component and the product function to support the above classification, are detailed in the technical reports of the products, in addition to the data sheets that demonstrate in detail on; the product description, product function, chemical composition, toxicology report.






26.
The Appellant affirmed that its products are essential mineral based premixes designed to be used in the preparations and/ or manufacture of complete animal feeds, which add nutritional value to complete animal feed.






27.
Additionally, the Appellant averred that its products have adhered to the antibiotic content between 8- 16 % as stated above and that its products not only improve animal digestion and safeguard animal health but also in their preparations and/ or analysis include active substances and consist of several mineral substances but also act as carriers and which consist of either of one or more organic nutritive substances.






28.
That all of the aforementioned products are added to the compound feed at levels between 0.2% and 0.5% as further emphasised in its objection and the reports provided.






29.
That in response to the Respondent's position, the Appellant noted that the premise thereof was based on sample analysis, which: -
a.
The Respondent has not provided any report of the samples tested;
b.
The alleged analysis, had the following findings; -
i.
Miavit Egg Yolk Colorant - made it a feed additive added to complete feed
ii.
Belmill layer basemix - a feed supplement that is a complimentary feed for pigs, poultry and ruminants.
iii.
Miavit Sigma Bravo Premix - specified as a feed additive.
iv.
Miaphos liquid miavit- a liquid complimentary feed supplement for poultry for additional temporary mineral supply.






30.
That in response thereto, the Appellant vehemently opposed the above findings for the following reasons: -
a.
The laboratory report, which informed the above findings, has never been availed to the Appellant.
b.
There is no law that imposes a duty rate of 10% on premixes used in manufacturing animal and poultry feed. The mandate of the Respondent is to enforce the law, not create it.
c.
A reading of the law confirms that classification is primarily based on the function of the product and the chemical analysis are a secondary determinant.
d.
The Respondent arbitrarily imposed chemical nuances to exclude the Appellant’s products under its correct code. The said nuances are neither provided by the law, nor do they have any basis. Particularly, on Sigma Bravo Premix, the Respondent stated it has a high crude protein of 28% component and as such falls under 23.90.90. This is neither stated in the East Africa Harmonised Commodity description and Coding System nor the WCO Explanatory Notes in Chapter 23.
e.
With all due respect, it is not clear to the Appellant which products the Respondent would subject under 23.90.10 as clearly every product, to attract a 10% tax rate should fall under 23.90.90, notwithstanding the provisions of the law.
f.
The above arbitral imposition has attracted a highly punitive liability, whose potential could cripple the Appellant's business, which is key in the agriculture sector.






31.
The Appellant requested the Tribunal to frown upon the Respondent's illegal and unconstitutional actions, which are a clear abuse of the Respondent's duty.






32.
That on the grounds of illegality, the Appellant submitted that the Respondent should be estopped from enforcing a tax demand that has no legal backing.






33.
That on a technical submission, the Appellant noted that the Respondent grossly misapplied itself by issuing tax demands of Mialick Lactation and Mialick Fattening, despite having not replied to the Appellant's objection dated 5
th
 August, 2022, as stipulated by Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 that clearly states as follows:
“
The Commissioner shall make the objection decision within sixty days from the date of receipt of-
(a)
the notice of objection; or
(b)
any further information the Commissioner may require from the taxpayer, failure to which the objection shall be deemed to be allowed.”






34.
That in support of the above, the Appellant invoked the case of 
Eastleigh Mall Limited vs Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement Appeal No. E0686 of 2020
 where the Court held that the Respondent's failure to issue an objection decision within the stipulated 60 days meant that the objection by the Appellant had been allowed.






35.
That quite surprising, on 26
th
 July, 2023, the Respondent through its letter referenced; “Review of classification for premix Belmill Layer Basemix; M/S Miavit Limited” addressed to the Appellant stated;-
a)
On page 1, last paragraph “Notably, the mineral content in the product is significant however, there is a significant amount of crude protein (28%) in the product, as well as poultry protein (8%) hence there is a nutritive element to the product that can be attributed to this composition.”
b)
On page 3 – “Based on the above information as per GIR 1 and GIR 6 rules of classification PREMIX BELMILL LAYER BASEMIX is hereby classified in 2022 EAC/CET code 2309.90.10 that provides for premixes.”
c)
“Therefore, the tariff guidance that classified the PREMIX BELMILL LAYER BASEMIX, in 2022 EAC/CET code 2309.90.90 is hereby revoked.”






36.
The Appellant invoked the principle of legitimate expectation and invited the Tribunal to bind the Respondent to its ruling and declare that the products are correctly declared under tariff sub-heading 2309.90.10.








Appellant’s Prayers


37.
The Appellant prayed that:
a.
The Respondent's review decision dated 18
th
 July, 2023 be set aside in its entirety;
b.
The Respondent's demand notice dated 29
th
 May, 2023 be vacated; and
c.
The Appeal be allowed with costs to the Appellant.








Respondent’s Case


38.
The Respondent’s case is premised on:
a.
The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 13
th
 October, 2023 and filed on 16
th
 October, 2023.
b.
The Respondent’s witness statement of Stella Mwangi dated 19
th
 April, 2024 and filed on 22
nd
 April, 2024; admitted in evidence under oath on 15
th
 May, 2024.






39.
The Respondent stated that the Appellant imported consignments of animal feed products vide Entry Numbers 23EMKIM400707272, 23EMKIM400395770 and 23EMKIM400478408. That as per the declaration, the above-mentioned products were classified under 2022 EAC/CET Code 2309.90.10.






40.
That the reclassification of the imported products was requested from the release point and random sampling was conducted as per Valuation & Tariff submittal form dated 7
th
 July, 2023 for Entry 23EMKIM400707272.






41.
Samples of the products were availed from the consignment and the Inspection and Testing Centre (I&TC) carried out further testing and analysis on the same. That the products were classified as feed supplements under 2022 EAC/CET Code 2309.90.90. That this tariff 2309.90.90 attracts 10% Import duty whereas what the Appellant used has 0% Import duty vide tariff rulings with references KRA/C&BC/BIA/THQ/338/05 and KRA/CBC/BIA/THQ/610/083/08/2023.






42.
The Respondent averred that classification of goods is done in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation in order. The Respondent further averred that Rule 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the Headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes.






43.
The Respondent stated that Heading 23.09 covers the classification of preparations which improve digestion and more generally ensure that the animal makes good use of the feeds to safeguard its health: vitamins or provitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, coccidiostats, trace elements, flavorings, appetizers etc.






44.
The Respondent submitted that the tariff code 2309.90.10 covers “Premixes used in the manufacture of animal and poultry feeds” whereas the tariff code 2309.90.90 covers “Preparations of a kind used in animal feeding.”






45.
That the product Maivit Egg Yolk Colourant which is basically considered to be a food additive intended for egg laying hens is therefore correctly classified under tariff code 2309.90.90 as guided by GIR 1&6 and attracts import duty rate of 10%.






46.
That the products are generally used either as feed additives or supplements for balancing farm feeds, fattening lactation and to ensure that the animals make good use of the feeds to safeguard their health.






47.
That the Respondent acted fairly and within the provisions of the law as mandated under Sections 235, 236 and 135 of EACCMA, 2004.








Respondent’s prayers


48.
The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal:
a.
Upholds and affirms the Respondent's review decision dated 6
th
 April, 2023.
b.
Dismisses the Appeal with costs to the Respondent.








Issues For Determination


49.
The Tribunal notes that subsequent to the filing the Appeal, the parties entered into a Partial Consent that settled the classification of some of the products under dispute.






50.
The Tribunal, having considered the pleadings, evidence adduced, and submissions made by the parties as well as the Partial Consent filed, is of the considered view that the issue that crystalizes for its determination is: Whether the Respondent was justified in reclassifying the Appellant’s products.








Analysis And Determination


51.
The Tribunal, having identified the issue that falls for its determination proceeds to analyse it as hereunder.






52.
The dispute herein arose out of the parties’ disagreement on whether the Appellant’s imported products are generally used either as feed additives or supplements for balancing farm feeds, fattening lactation and to ensure that the animals make good use of the feeds to safeguard their health thus justifying the re-classification of the product from HS code 2309.90.10 to HS code 2309.90.90.






53.
The issue in dispute is therefore hinged on whether the subject products are premixes used in the manufacture of animal feed, or additives and supplements designed to balance farm feeds, fatten animals during lactation and ensure that the animals make good use of the feeds to safeguard their health.






54.
The Appellant submitted to this Tribunal that under the World Customs Organization’s General Interpretative Rules (GIRs) and the EAC/CET, the products are classifiable under HS Code 2309.90.10 which attracts duty at 0%, the basis being that the products are pre-mixes used in the manufacture of animal feeds. It further averred that the Respondent disregarded data sheets that it provided to prove that the imported products were premixes.






55.
It is noteworthy that from the technical documents submitted by the Appellant, its products have been described as follows:
a.
Premix Belmill Layer Basemix contains calcium carbonate, monocalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate which are minerals.
b.
Sigma Bravo Premix contains calcium carbonate, brewers' grains, yeasts, brewers' yeast, poultry protein, liver hydrolysate (for poultry), glucosamine (chitosamine), chondroitin sulphate, sodium chloride.
c.
Miaphos contains calcium, phosphorous, sodium, magnesium, copper, manganese and zinc which are vitamin additives. This product is added to drinking water of poultry.
d.
Egg Yolk Colorant premix contains canthaxanthin, ethyl ester and calcium carbonate which are mineral additives. The data sheet recommended that the dose of the product should be 0.1% in a complete feed of laying hens.
e.
Avatec 150G, Mialick fattening and Ribenz 66G contains minerals to be added to the feed.






56.
The Tribunal relies on the General Interpretative Rules (GIRs) in determining the applicable tariff classification of the Appellant’s product. Specifically, the Tribunal has looked at Rules 1, 2b and 3(a), to the extent that the product being classified consists of a mixture of ingredients.






57.
The Rules state as follows:-






58.
“1.The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:






59.
2(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.






60.
3. When by application of Rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:






61.
(a)
The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.”






62.
Further, according to the EAC/CET, HS classification, Heading 2309 is set out as follows;
“
2309: Preparations of a kind used in animal feeding.
2309.90.00: Dog or cat food put up for retail sale.
2309.90.10: Premixes used in the manufacture of animal and poultry feeds.
2309.90.90: Other.”






63.
Further the Explanatory Notes to Heading 2309 define a premix as follows:
“
…premixes ”, are, generally speaking, compound compositions consisting of a number of substances (sometimes called additives) the nature and proportions of which vary according to the animal production required. These substances are of        three types:
(1)
Those which improve digestion and, more generally, ensure that the animal makes good use of the feeds and safeguard its health: vitamins or provitamins, amino-acids, antibiotics, coccidiostats, trace elements, emulsifiers, flavourings and appetisers, etc.
(2)
Those designed to preserve the feeding stuffs (particularly the fatty components) until consumption by the animal: stabilisers, anti-oxidants, etc.
(3)
Those which serve as carriers and which may consist either of one or more organic nutritive substances (manioc or soya flour or meal, middlings, yeast, various residues of the food industries, etc.) or of inorganic substances (e.g., magnesite, chalk, kaolin, salt, phosphates).
The concentration of the substances described in (1) above and the nature of the carrier are determined so as to ensure, in particular, homogeneous dispersion and mixing of these substances in the compound feeds to which the preparations are added.” (Emphasis added)






64.
The Tribunal in its analysis relied on its explanation in TAT 124 of 2021; Bidco Africa Limited vs. Commissioner of Customs and Border Control where it stated that;
“


65.
The criteria for classifying products according to intended purpose is used to classify over 60 products copiously spread across the EAC nomenclature for        example:
Plasters specially calcined or finely ground for use in dentistry (Heading 25.20)
Preparations with a basis of plaster for use in dentistry (Heading 34.07).
Preparations for use on the hair (Heading 33 05).
Shapes, sections, tubes and the like, prepared for use in structures, of iron or steel (Heading 73 08).
The intended use is indeed one of “the terms of the headings” envisaged in GIR 1 which provides as follows;
“
The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:” (Emphasis added)








65.
It follows therefore that the Tribunal, in determining whether the products in question were premixes or not has reviewed the data sheets provided and the intended purpose of the products, and it notes that all the products in dispute are added to animal feeds and are supposed to be mixed in specified quantities to the animal feeds to create the complete nutritional product given to the animals. In this regard, the products in question qualify to be classified as premixes as they are not complete products that can be consumed in the form in which they are imported.






66.
In the circumstances, and after considering the Chapter Notes, Explanatory Notes, product descriptions, the intended use of the product and the case law, the Tribunal determines that the product imported by the Appellant is classifiable under tariff code 2309.90.10






67.
In view of the foregoing finding, the Tribunal holds that the Respondent erred and was thus not justified in reclassifying the Appellant’s imported products from HS Code 2309.90.10 to HS Code 2309.90.90.








Final Decision


68.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
b.
The Respondent’s review decision dated 18
th
 July, 2023 be and is hereby set aside.
c.
Each Party to bear its own costs.






69.
It is so ordered.

G.W.K  ...................................... 2ND APPLICANT








Judgment










1.
The Applicant filed an Originating Summons dated 13 May 2024, Statement in Support of the Application for an Adoption Order and Affidavit in Support of the Application, seeking:
i.
(spent)
ii.
(spent)
iii.
That the Applicants be authorised to adopt abandoned baby alias unknown baby TM alias baby A.Z to be known as M.M.G;
iv.
That the child be presumed a Kenyan citizen by birth;
v.
That the child’s date of birth be 10 April 2023 and the place of birth be Machakos County;
vi.
That the Registrar General be directed to enter the adoption in the Adopted Children Register;
vii.
That the Director Immigration be authorised to issue the child with a Kenyan passport;
viii.
That the 2nd Applicant’s sister, J.C.W.K, and her husband, A.M.W, be appointed as legal guardians of the child in the event of the death or incapacity of the Applicants before the child is of age or independent;
ix.
That the Court be pleased to make any further orders it deems necessary.






2.
The matter was canvassed by way of viva voce evidence on the virtual platform.






The Child


3.
The child (male) is presumed to have been born on 10 April 2023. He was found abandoned at Kyumbi area, Machakos County and rescued by a good Samaritan. The matter was reported at the Kyumbi Police Station vide OB No. 3/14/04/2023. The child was committed to Mahali pa Maisha on 8 May 2023 by the Children’s Court at Machakos in Case No. 18 of 2023.






4.
The child was declared free for adoption on 26 October 2023 by the Change Trust, a registered Adoption Agency, vide the annexed Certificate serial number 006XXXX. I am, therefore, satisfied that this legal pre-requisite for an adoption has been met.






5.
The child, currently 15 months old, was placed with the Applicants on 8 October 2023.








The Applicants


6.
The Applicants are Kenyan citizens, residing in Nairobi. They are a married couple and have been married since 12 June 2010. They have one daughter, aged 8 years, who was adopted in October 2018.






7.
The 1st Applicant is a cyber security engineer, while the 2nd Applicant is Channel Manager. The Applicants testified that having the child has been a wonderful experience. The child has really bonded with their daughter as well as the extended family. The Applicants confirmed that they fully understand the implications of an adoption order and that the same is irreversible.






8.
The Applicants proposed JCWK and AMW to be the legal guardians of the child. JCWK is a sister to the 2nd Applicant and AMW is the 2nd Applicant’s brother-in-law. They confirmed that they fully understand the implications of the order and had willingly consented to the appointment.








The Adoption Application


9.
I have considered the Summons, the evidence on record as well as the various reports filed in a bid to determine whether the Applicants are suitable adoptive parents.






10.
Change Trust conducted an assessment of the Applicants. The Agency filed its report dated 26 September 2023 declaring the child free for adoption and recommending the adoption.






11.
On 30 May 2024, the Court issued an order appointing WGN as the child’s Guardian ad Litem, and further directing the Guardian ad Litem and Director of Children’s Services to investigate the suitability and fitness of the Applicant and subsequently file their respective reports.






12.
The Guardian ad Litem filed his report dated 4th June 2024, recommending the adoption. The report notes that the child has bonded well with the Applicants and their daughter and is learning and able to communicate with the Applicants in Kikuyu and English. The Directorate of Children’s Services filed its report dated 25 June 2024, recommending the adoption of the child by the Applicants herein.






13.
From the material availed and oral testimonies, I am satisfied that the Applicants are quite suited to be adoptive parents.






14.
Accordingly, I allow the Originating Summons and make the following orders:
i.
That the Applicants, S.G.N and G.W.K, are allowed to adopt the child currently identified as Abandoned Baby alias Unknown Baby Taji Malaika alias A.Z;
ii.
That henceforth, the child will be known as M.M.G;
iii.
The child is declared to be a Kenyan citizen by birth, entitled to all the rights and privileges under 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and all applicable laws;
iv.
J.C.W.K and A.M.W are appointed as legal Guardians of the child,
v.
The Guardian 
ad Litem
 is hereby discharged;

          ((Being   an   Appeal   from   the   Judgment   of   the   Resident Magistrate’s Court at Kiambu by the Honourable S.K. Motari delivered on the 25th day of May 2022 in CMCC NO. 474 OF 2020))
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant filed Civil Suit CMCC 47A of 2020 before the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Kiambu seeking damages for injuries sustained when the motor vehicle KAU 675X, in which she was traveling, was involved in an accident with motor vehicle KBY 516Q on 23
rd
 September, 2017 along Ruaka - Kahawa West road.






2.
The Appellant sued the 1
st
 Respondent, the driver of motor vehicle KAU 675X on the date of the accident, and the 2
nd
 Respondent, the registered owner of the motor vehicle. The Respondents did not enter an appearance nor file a defence, and the case proceeded through formal proof.






3.
In the judgment delivered on 25
th
 March, 2022, the trial Court held that the Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof on the issue of liability against the Respondents and dismissed the suit.






4.
The Appellant being aggrieved with the decision, preferred this Appeal on the following grounds: -
i.
That the Honourable Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to have due regard, take into account and appreciate the substantive issues of law and facts raised by the Appellant during the hearing and in the submissions, authorities and other documents on record.
ii.
That Honourable Court Magistrate erred in law and fact by finding that the Appellant failed to prove her case even after she produced a police abstract in her evidence showing who was to blame for the accident forming the substratum of the lower court’s suit.
iii.
That this Honourable Court Magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to uphold the best interests of the minors while writing and pronouncing her judgment.
iv.
That in all circumstances of the case, the Honourable Magistrate erred in dismissing the Appellant’s reply to Respondent’s application.
v.
That the Honourable Magistrate erred in law and fact by dismissing the Plaintiff’s case, which was unchallenged by the Defendants.






5.
The Appellant prayed for the following orders: -
(a)
That the Judgment and Order in Kiambu Chief Magistrate’s Court No. 474 of 2020; Catherin Anyimi Wesonga Versus Shamji Ramji Bhudia & Raman Enterprises delivered on 25
th
 day of March, 2022 be set aside.
(b)
That the Honourable Court award the Plaintiff the prayers sought in Kiambu
Chief Magistrate’s Court Case No. 474 of 2020; Catherine Anyimi Wesonga Versus Shamji Ramji Bhudia & Raman Enterprises.
(c)
Cost of this Appeal be awarded to the Appellant.






6.
The Respondents were served but did not participate in the Appeal. The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.




DIVISION -- Analysis and determination:
PARA 7.
Being a first Appeal, this Court is bound to re-evaluate the evidence on record and come up with its own findings.
Justice C.W. Githua in Suluenta Kennedy Sita & Another Vs. Jeremiah Ruto (suing as legal representative of the Estate of Joyce Jepkemboi) [2017] Eklr stated as follows: -
“
A first appellant court is enjoined to re-evaluate all the evidence adduced before the lower court in order to reach its own independent conclusions but in doing so, it should give due allowance to the fact that it did not have the opportunity of seeing or hearing the witnesses.”
PARA 8.
The Appellant blamed the Respondents for the accident at the formal proof hearing. She adopted her witness statement as her evidence. She stated that on 23
rd
 September 2017 at around 1600 hours, she was traveling as a passenger in motor vehicle KAU 675X, which was being driven along Ruaka-Kahawa West road or thereabouts when an accident occurred involving the motor vehicle she was traveling in and motor vehicle KBY 516Q.
PARA 9.
The appellant said that the motor vehicle KBY 516Q was being driven along the road at high speed when it veered off and caused the accident. The Appellant blamed the 1
st
 Respondent for speeding, as a result of which he lost control of the said motor vehicle. She accused the 1
st
 Respondent of driving carelessly and causing the accident.
PARA 10.
In the submissions before this Court, the Appellant has urged the Court to find that she discharged the burden of proof and invited the Court to hold that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor was applicable in her favour.
PARA 11.
The issues for determination are as follows: -
SUBPARA (i)
Whether the Appellant discharged the burden of proof that the Respondents were liable for the occurrence of the accident wherein the Appellant was injured.
SUBPARA (ii)
Question of quantum.


Burden of Proof:


12.
The Appellant testified and produced exhibits in Court in support of her claim against the Respondents. That included the following: -
1)
Copy of the Police abstract
2)
Copy of Statutory notice
3)
Demand letter
4)
Motor vehicle search of KBY 516Q
5)
Medical summaries and medical report
6)
P3 Form.






13.
There is proof from the exhibits that an accident occurred on the 23
rd
 of September, 2017, and that the Appellant was injured as a result of the accident. The accident involved motor vehicle KAU 675X and motor vehicle KBY 516Q. The Police abstract captures the 1
st
 Respondent as the driver of the motor vehicle KBY 516Q on the date of the accident. The copy of motor vehicle search records shows that the car is registered in the name of the 2
nd
 Respondent.






14.
The trial Court, in the judgment, indicated that the Appellant had not pleaded particulars of negligence against the Respondents in her pleadings. I have read the plaint dated 28th September 2020, and the particulars of negligence have been pleaded in paragraph 
5
.
“
That on or about the 23
rd
 September 2017, the plaintiff was lawfully traveling in motor vehicle registration No. KAU 675X along Ruaka-Kahawa West road or thereabout when the defendant or defendant’s driver/agent and /or servant so negligently drove managed and/or controlled the said motor vehicle registration No. KBY 516Q Tata lorry, that he caused and/or permitted the same to cause the accident, thereby causing the Plaintiff serious injuries.
Particulars of negligence of the Defendants, their driver, servant, employee, and/or agent:
a)
Driving at an excessive speed in the circumstances;
b)
Causing or permitting the said motor vehicle registration number KBY 516Q to cause injuries;
c)
Failing to stop, slow down, swerve, or in any way manage or control the said motor vehicle to avoid the accident;
d)
Failing to maintain any or any proper care and control of the said motor vehicle
e)
Causing the accident.
f)
The Plaintiff will rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor.






15.
The doctrine of res ipsa loquitor is pleaded in paragraph 
5
.






16.
The Appellant was traveling as a passenger in motor vehicle KAU 675X. In her testimony, she did not explain how the accident happened. The trial Court observed that the circumstances relating to the accident were not explained and that the burden of proof on the issue of liability against the Respondents had not been discharged.






17.
Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
 provides as follows: -
(1)
Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.
(2)
When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.






18.
The police abstract dated 16
th
 April, 2017 indicated that the accident was pending investigation. This is contrary to what the Appellant submits: that the accident is attributed to the 1
st
 Respondent in the police abstract.






19.
The burden of proof lies on the party asserting the truth of an issue in dispute. This burden doesn’t change even in formal proof hearings, as the party has to adduce evidence sufficient to sustain the suit. Besides, the rules of evidence and procedure must always be observed.
The entry of interlocutory judgment against the Respondents did not absolve the Appellant from the requisite of proving liability. The Appellant’s claim was on negligence and needed to discharge the burden of proof on liability for the claim to succeed. This is as anticipated by Order 10, Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Rules. It was not enough to merely plead the particulars of negligence. The Appellant particularised the allegations of negligence in the Plaint but did not lead evidence on the same.






20.
Can the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor come to the rescue of the Appellant?
Res ipsa loquitor does not fully reverse the burden of proof and does not have a blanket application on all negligence claims. It is not obvious from the evidence before the Court that the Respondents were liable for the accident. The facts of the accident could have been proved through additional evidence.






21.
The present case was not a single-vehicle accident, and it is not more probable that one driver other than the other was negligent. The Appellant was traveling in another vehicle; negligence cannot be inferred from the Respondents without proof in the evidence that the other was negligent. Based on the set facts presented, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor cannot come to the rescue of the Appellant in this case.






22.
Whereas this case proceeded through formal proof, the onus of adducing and producing evidence that must satisfy the Court rested on the Appellant. The Appellant treated the matter casually because of the interlocutory judgment entered against the Respondents.






23.
The learned magistrate had due regard to issues of law and fact as presented by the appellant. I find no reason to disturb the trial court’s finding on liability.








Quantum:


24.
On quantum, the Appellant submitted that an award of Kshs.200,000/= would be adequate compensation for the injuries outlined as;
a)
Blunt injuries (tender chest anteriorly
b)
Bruises – both legs






25.
As a general principle, assessing damages for personal bodily injuries requires exercising court discretion. Still, the said discretion must be exercised judiciously, considering the facts of each case, particularly the injuries sustained and comparable awards previously made for similar injuries.






26.
In assessing damages, the court made reference to two authorities:
FM (Minor suing through Mother and next friend MWM) v JNM & another [2020] eKLR where the appellant sustained blunt object injury to the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and limbs. The court awarded an award of Kshs.100,000/= for general damages.
Caroline Chepkemoi Chelule v John Kung & another [2022] eKLR: The Appellant sustained soft tissue injuries, including tenderness in the neck, back, and both hands. The High Court assessed general damages at Kshs. 100,000/=.






27.
I have read the authorities relied on by the Appellant in the submissions before the lower Court, and I find that the injuries outlined in them are more severe than those outlined by the Appellant. The authorities referred to by the trial Court are more persuasive, and I uphold the assessment of general damages at Kshs.120,000/=. Special damages pleaded and proved were correct to the tune of KES. 5,070/=. Had the appellant successfully proven liability, the damages awarded by the trial court would be in order.






28.
This Appeal lacks merit and is dismissed with no order as to costs.




It is so ordered.

Ruling










A. Dispute background


1.
The landlord/applicant moved this Tribunal vide a Reference dated 12
th
 April 2024 under Section 12(4) of the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
 Cap 301 with a complaint that the tenants were duly served with notices of termination of tenancy in the prescribed form on 31
st
 January 2024, which were to take effect on 1
st
 April 2024 but have not responded to the said notices or surrendered vacant possession of the suit premises.






2.
The landlord/applicant simultaneously filed a notice of motion under a certificate of urgency dated 12
th
 April 2024 in which he sought for the following orders; -
i.
That the application be certified urgent.
ii.
That the honorable tribunal be pleased to issue a mandatory injunction against the respondents to deliver vacant possession of the premises located in Eastleigh 1
st
 Avenue on Juja Road pending hearing and determination of the application.
iii.
That the honorable tribunal be pleased to grant an order allowing the landlord to enter and repossess the suit premises with the assistance of the O.C.S Pangani Police Station.
iv.
That the honorable tribunal be pleased to grant the landlord any other consequential relief it deems fit and just in the circumstances.
v.
That costs be borne by the respondents.






3.
The application is supported by the landlord’s affidavit of even date in which he deposes as follows; -
i.
That the tenants herein were duly served with Notices to terminate tenancy in the prescribed form on 31
st
 January 2024 which were to take effect on 1
st
 April 2024 but have not responded to the said notices or surrendered vacant possession of the suit premises. A copy of the said notice and affidavit of service are annexed as “JK1”.
ii.
That the landlord wants to convert the suit premises for personal use since the respondents have refused to pay rent as and when it falls due for collection.
iii.
That there is no reference filed by the respondents in opposition to the said notice.
iv.
That the continued occupation by the respondents has occasioned the landlord loss and damages for reasons that it has precluded the landlord from earning rental income from the suit premises at the prevailing market rate.






4.
The application was slated for hearing on 20
th
 May 2024 when the tenants were granted leave to file and serve their respective replying affidavits to the application.






5.
The tenants filed their replying affidavit dated 30
th
 May 2024 in which they depose as follows; -
i.
That the tenants have been paying monthly rent dutifully and have never defaulted in rent payment. Copies or Mpesa Statements are annexed as “M.C.1”.
ii.
That the termination notices served upon the tenants are malicious with no sufficient grounds and that the tenants pray that the court grants them leave to file references dated 30
th
 May 2024 out of time. Copies of the references are annexed as “M.C.2”.
iii.
That failure to file the said references in time was not intentional but due to lack of knowledge.
iv.
That the tenants have invested heavily and established business goodwill and if evicted, they will incur immense loss and damages.
v.
That the tenants have done repairs, renovations and improvements of the suit premises at estimated costs.






6.
At a subsequent court hearing on 6
th
 June 2024, the tenants sought to file an application to oppose the notice of termination of tenancy out of time. The court granted the tenants leave to file the said application.






7.
The tenants then filed a notice of motion dated 20
th
 June 2024 in which they sought for the following orders; -
i.
That the application be certified urgent.
ii.
That the court be pleased to allow the tenants to oppose the legal termination notices dated 17
th
 January 2024 out of time by filing references dated 30
th
 May 2024 pending hearing and determination of the case.
iii.
That the landlord be restrained from evicting the tenant from the suit premises pending hearing and determination of the case.
iv.
That the landlord be ordered to allow the tenant unlimited access to the suit premises pending hearing and determination of the case.
v.
That the landlord be restrained from interfering with the tenants’ quiet and peaceful occupation of the suit premises in any manner whatsoever pending hearing and determination of the case.
vi.
That the O.C.S Pangani Police Station do assist in compliance with the orders.
vii.
That costs of the application be provided for.






8.
The application is supported by an affidavit of even date in which the 3
rd
 respondent/tenant deposes as follows; -
i.
That due to financial constraints, the tenants did not manage to oppose the said notice to terminate tenancy by filing references.
ii.
That due to the respondent’s interference with the tenants’ quiet occupation of the suit premises, the 3
rd
 respondent stands to suffer in the hands of the landlord.






9.
At a court hearing on 2
nd
 July 2024, the landlord stated that the tenants had rent arrears of which the tenants denied with some saying that they had only arrears of one month which they intended to pay on the same day. The court directed that the matter be canvassed by way of written submissions and the landlord was granted leave to respond to the application dated 20
th
 June 2024 and the tenants were granted leave to file their further affidavit.






10.
The tenants filed their further affidavit dated 17
th
 July 2024 in which they reiterated the statements in their replying affidavit dated 30
th
 May 2024 and annexed copies of Mpesa statements to prove rent payment.






11.
Only the tenants complied by filing their written submissions dated 17
th
 July 2024 which we shall consider as we deal with the issues for determination.








B. Issues for determination


12.
The following are the issues for determination; -
a.
Whether the application dated 20
th
 June 2024 is merited.
b.
Who shall bear the costs of the application?








Issue (a) Whether the application dated 20th June 2024 is merited.


13.
The tenants filed the application dated 20
th
 June 2024 seeking leave to file a reference to oppose the notice to terminate tenancy issued to them by the landlord herein out of time as well as orders to restrain the landlord from interfering with their tenancy pending the hearing of the reference






14.
The tenants in their affidavits have not denied that they were served with a notice to terminate tenancy dated on 31
st
 January 2024 which was to take effect on 1
st
 April 2024.






15.
The tenants in their written submissions state that their application is merited as they have a genuine claim requiring the court’s intervention. They also submit they have been paying their rent diligently and that the termination notices are malicious.






16.
The tenants in their written submissions have directed the court to a decision in the case of Ahmed Sirjat Noor v Hbm Power & Technology Ltd [2022] eKLR where Hon. Gakuhi Chege stated as follows; -
16.
Given the foregoing definition, I am satisfied that failure by the tenant to file a reference in the format prescribed under Cap.301 is not fatal and does not warrant me to exercise the draconian powers of striking out the pleadings. In any event, I am not told what prejudice the landlord will suffer if this Tribunal was to consider the pleadings filed herein as a reference or complaint contemplated under Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya.
17.
I am fortified in this holding by the decision in the case of Essaji – vs- Solanki (1968) EA 218 where it was held as follows: -
“The administration of justice should normally require that the substance of all disputes should be investigated and decided on their merits and that errors and lapses should not necessarily debar a litigant from the pursuit of his rights”.
18.
This principle was restated in the case of Trust Bank Ltd – vs- Amalo Company Ltd (2002) eKLR where the court of appeal held that the principle which guides the court in the administration of justice when adjudicating on any dispute is that where possible disputes should be heard on their own merit”.”






17.
The tenants have further directed the court to the case of Nancy Njeri Gitau & another v James Muchone Njuga & another [2021] eKLR wherein Hon. Gakuhi Chege observed as follows; -
“
46.In the premises, I find that the notice of termination of tenancy despite the fact that it took effect for failure to file a Reference as required was superseded by subsequent events of acceptance of rent and continued occupation of the suit premises by the tenants.”






18.
We have perused the Mpesa statements filed by the tenants and we find that indeed the tenants have continued to pay rent to the landlord even after the expiry of the notices to terminate tenancy.






19.
We also note that the landlord has not filed any response to the application by the tenants dated 20
th
 June 2024 despite being granted leave to do so.






20.
Based on the above analysis, the tribunal shall allow the tenants an opportunity to present their issues so as to enable the tribunal evaluate the substance of the case and thereafter rule on the dispute on merit.








Issue (b) Who shall bear the costs of the application?


21.
As regards costs, the same are in the tribunal’s discretion under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall order the costs of the application to abide the outcome of the hearing.








C. Orders


22.
In conclusion, the following orders commend to us; -
a.
The application dated 20
th
 June 2024 is hereby allowed.
b.
Costs of the application shall abide the hearing of the references filed by the tenants which are dated 30
th
 May 2024.
c.
The application and the reference by the landlord dated 12
th
 April 2024 shall be determined together with the tenants’ references.
d.
Parties are granted 30 days hereof to comply with Order 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules by filing witnesses’ statements and any other documents in support of their respective cases including rent account statements.
e.
Costs of the application shall abide the outcome of the hearing.




It is so ordered.

Between




Nancy Muthoni Wairagu


 


Appellant




and




National Land Commission


 


Respondent










Judgment










Background


1.
This suit is a sequel to ELCA No. 34B of 2020 (the ELC suit). In the ELC suit, the Appellant had contested the process of compulsory acquisition in respect of her land known as L.R. No. Muguga/Gitaru/2437 (the suit property). While agreeing with her, the court found that the Respondent had failed to adhere to the process of compulsory acquisition as provided for in the 
Land Act
. The Respondent was therefore ordered to conduct the process afresh and, specifically, to conduct a fresh inquiry in respect to the suit land within 60 days from the date of judgement.






2.
It is from this process that the Appellant is now aggrieved having been issued with a new award of compensation for the sum of Kshs. 55,451,170/- through a letter dated 2
nd
 November 2022 to the Appellant’s advocates (the award). Following leave of this Tribunal granted on 16
th
 May 2024, the Appellant filed a Memorandum of Appeal dated 20
th
 May 2024 and a Supporting Affidavit dated 21
st
 May 2024. The appeal is also supported by the affidavits of Christopher Omare, M.D. Kamau, and Zacharia Makenzi Ndeti; all sworn on 21
st
 June 2024






3.
The instant Appeal is based on several grounds which can be summed as follows:
a.
That the award issued is not reflective of a fair and just compensation for the suit land; and
b.
That the Respondent failed to appreciate that the partial acquisition of the suit land rendered the remaining area of the land economically unviable.






4.
The Appellant avers that the award is not only in contravention of the Decree of the Environment and Land Court but also a gross undervaluation of the suit property. On the first limb, the Appellant asserts that the Respondent disregarded the Court Order issued on 8
th
 February 2022 by the ELC by failing to conduct inquiries on compensation within a period of 60 days. Further, on the second limb, the Appellant avers, that the Respondent failed to take into account the market value of the property and as such arrived at an arbitrary, unilateral and erroneous award as compensation which was lower than the market value of the property.






5.
The Appellant further contends that the Respondent failed to conduct a fresh valuation exercise and instead relied on an old and outdated valuation exercise conducted on 7
th
 May 2018. Consequently, the Appellant contends that the award – having been based on a valuation report done in 2018 – cannot give an accurate market value of the Suit Property.






6.
The Appellant also contends that the award failed to take into consideration other factors that are relevant such as costs of the improvement, loss of rental income, improvements made, increase in land value, number of people living there, damage caused on the Appellant, land value index, existing charge in favour of Bank of Baroda over the property and damage sustained or likely to be sustained by the Appellant in the process of compulsory acquisition.






7.
The Appellant further avers that the part acquisition of the suit property renders the remaining area of the land economically unviable since the remainder of the building on the suit property cannot be accommodated in the remainder of the area without violating the building code and zoning policy and guidelines.






8.
The Appellant therefore prays for the following:
a.
This Appeal be allowed with costs.
b.
The Award of Compensation by the National Land Commission dated 2
nd
 November 2022 by Kabale Tache Arero, Ag. Secretary/CEO, National Land Commission, pursuant to Section 113(1) of the 
Land Act
 2012 for acquisition of the Property Land Reference Number MUGUGA/GITARU/2437 for use as proposed by the Kenya National Highways Authority for the project A104 JAMES GICHURU JUNCTION-RIRONI JUNCTION (A104/B3) ROAD PROJECT be set aside.
c.
The Award be varied and the same be substituted with a just and fair compensation.
d.
The Honourable Tribunal do and hereby adopt the value of the Property and the improvements thereon as contained in the valuation report filed by the Appellant prepared by Zanconsult Valuers & Management Company Limited dated 1
st
 August 2022 at Kenya Shillings Ninety Four Million Eight Hundred and Seventy Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty Four (KShs 94,870,844) be awarded as the market value of the Property which ought to be paid to the Appellant.
e.
Respondent to pay costs of valuation at KES 45,000/=
f.
Spent.
g.
The Respondent to pay costs of this appeal.
h.
Any other or further relief deemed fit in favour of the Appellant.






9.
This appeal is opposed by the Respondent through the Replying Affidavit of Ms. Isabel Njeru, sworn on 18
th
 July 2024. Ms. Njeru identifies herself as the Chief Valuation Officer of the Respondent. She avers that the Respondent conducted a fresh inquiry process within the time stipulated by the ELC with the Appellant’s participation.






10.
Ms. Njeru further avers that upon completion of the process, the Respondent concluded that the award it initially offered to the Applicant was accurate and made the same offer thereby refuting the Applicant’s claims that the valuation was arbitrary, unfair or unjust. She asserted that the Respondent was in fact ordered to undertake a fresh inquiry process and not a fresh valuation and therefore carrying out a fresh valuation was irrelevant.






11.
Finally, Ms. Njeru contended that valuation for compulsory acquisition is done per the publication date of the notice of intention to acquire in the Gazette and therefore the Appellant’s assertion that the Respondent should have used the current market value is a misinformed take.






12.
The Respondent prays for the suit to be dismissed with costs.








Analysis and Determination


13.
The main borne of contention between the Appellant and the Respondent is whether the Respondent’s award of compensation for Kshs. 55,421,200/- is just and fair. Additionally, the parties have invited us to consider whether the process of compulsory acquisition of land undertaken by the Respondent in respect of the suit property complied with 
the Constitution
 and written law. Other attendant issues for determination to wit – appropriate reliefs, if any, and costs, shall be addressed thereafter.






14.
Before delving into the main issue for resolution, parties do not seem to agree whether the orders issued in the ELC suit were complied with. On the part of the Appellant, the process did not comply with the law for failure to comply with the orders of the ELC court to conduct fresh inquiries within sixty days. The Appellant argues that the award issued outside this timeframe is illegal and irregular.






15.
On its part, the Respondent argues that it complied with the order issued by the ELC by publishing a notice of inquiry via Gazette Notice Number. 4437 of 14
th
 April 2022, within the sixty-day period. Subsequently, the Respondent argues it conducted inquiries with the participation of the Appellant and issued an award which has been impugned by the Appellant.






16.
It is not in doubt that the process as ordered by the ELC was completed on 2
nd
 November 2022, almost nine months after the said order. No explanation has been offered by the Respondent in this regard. It should be borne in mind that the process of compulsory acquisition, especially the determination of compensation payable and the payment of such compensation, should be undertaken with urgency due to the disruptive nature of compulsory acquisition. In providing timelines for the completion of that exercise, the ELC had made a finding that the Respondent had failed to adhere to 
the Constitution
 and written law in undertaking the process that had been challenged in the ELC suit.






17.
We deprecate the failure to comply with the orders issued by the ELC but we are aware of the implications of making a finding that the outcome thereof is illegal and irregular as invited by the Appellant. In that regard, we find that although the Respondent did not conduct the fresh inquiry as ordered by the ELC within sixty days, the outcome of that process is not invalidated by this failure. Invalidating the outcome thereof would mean ordering a new inquiry to be conducted in the manner ordered by the ELC. We do not find that this is prudent in the circumstances where the Appellant is anxiously awaiting a resolution of this matter, six years since the acquisition was gazetted.






18.
On the question of whether the award of compensation issued by the Respondent is just and fair, the instant appeal is two pronged. First, the Appellant contends that the award is fundamentally flawed as it violates the principles of prompt, full and just compensation under Article 40 of 
the Constitution
 and Rule 3 of the Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules 2017. Second, the Appellant argues that the Respondent failed and refused to invoke the provisions of Section 122 of the 
Land Act
 thereby leaving a portion of the unacquired portion of the suit property which is inadequate and incompatible with the Appellant’s intended use.






19.
On the first limb, the Appellant relies on a valuation report dated 1
st
 August 2022 in regard to a valuation conducted on the suit property by Zanconsult Valuers and Management Company Limited (the Appellant’s valuation). This report is attached to the Affidavit of Mr. Zacharia Makenzi Ndeti and marked as “ZMN-3”. Mr. Ndeti, in his Affidavit sworn on 21
st
 June 2024, states that in his professional opinion the suit property had been undervalued by the Respondent.






20.
Mr. Ndeti impugns the comparables relied upon by the Respondent in its valuation report stating that the same do not reflect the market value as they are values declared for purposes of stamp duty which tend to be under declared to avoid paying more in stamp duty. Further, Mr. Ndeti faults the Respondent’s valuation of the incomplete floors of the development and argues that the Respondent ought not to have applied different rates for the completed floors and the incomplete floors.






21.
In the Appellant’s valuation, the valuer adopts a comparable sales and replacement cost approach in valuing the suit property together with the developments thereon. It is the opinion of the valuer that the unimproved site value of the suit property (measuring approximately 0.0465 hectares) is Kshs. 14,182,500/-. The valuer also places the value of the developments upon the suit property at Kshs. 59,000,000/-






22.
In a further affidavit sworn on 21
st
 June 2024, the Appellant depones that the unimproved site value of the suit property was Kshs. 10,000,000/- in the year 2016 when the same was valued by Njihia Njoroge & Company for purposes of a mortgage facility from Bank of Baroda. This valuation dated 14
th
 November 2016 is annexed to the said affidavit of the Appellant and marked “NMW-1”.






23.
On the other hand, the Respondent argues that it adhered to the law and process of valuing the suit property before an award was issued. The Respondent argues that the award is a true depiction of the value of the suit property. Adopting the same methodology as the Appellant, the Respondent arrives at a value for the unimproved site (0.0231 hectares) of Kshs. 3,424,810/- and a value of Kshs. 41,121,600/- for the developments thereon. This valuation report is dated 7
th
 May 2018 and forms part of the Respondent’s documents.






24.
The Appellant and the Respondent primarily differ on the acreage of the suit property to be acquiring (to be addressed below) and the valuation of the unimproved site as well as the improvements thereon. Before we deal with the question of the acquired acreage in the second limb of this analysis, we shall first deal with what just compensation is payable in this case.






25.
The requirement for payment of just compensation upon the exercise of the power of eminent domain is recognized under Article 40(3)(b) (i) of 
the Constitution
. Further, Section 125(1) of the 
Land Act
, 2012 requires that the National Land Commission shall pay full and just compensation to all persons interested in the land. To provide clarity on the amount of compensation due to a project affected person, the Respondent issued the Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules, 2017. In the said rules, 3. “The Commission shall consider the following factors when assessing compensation:
a.
the market value of the land;
b.
damage sustained or likely to be sustained by persons interested at the time of the Commission's taking possession of the land by reason of severing the land from his or her other land;
c.
damage sustained or likely to be sustained by persons interested at the time of the Commission's taking possession of the land by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his or her other property, whether moveable or immovable , in any other manner or his or her actual earnings;
d.
reasonable expenses incidental to the relocation any of the persons interested or who will be compelled to change residence or place of business as a consequence of the acquisition; and
e.
damage genuinely resulting from diminution of the profits of the land between the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of intention to acquire the land and the date the Commission takes possession of the land.”
1
1
Rule 3, Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules, 2017.
Emphasis added






26.
Market value is defined in Rule 2 thereof as “the value of the land at the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of intention to acquire the land.” This is the value payable to a project affected person plus an additional 15% disturbance allowance in accordance with Rule 6.






27.
Additionally, a project affected person who experiences diminution of the profits of the land between the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of intention to acquire the land and the date the commission takes possession of the land is entitled to damages under Rule 3(e) above.






28.
In interpreting the constitutional imperative of just compensation the High Court in Patrick Musimba v National Land Commission & 4 others [2016] eKLR held as follows:
“
In our view, a closer reading of Article 40(3) of 
the Constitution
 would reveal that 
the Constitution
 did not only intend to have the land owner who is divested of his property compensated or restituted for the loss of his property but sought to ensure that the public treasury from which compensation money is drawn is protected against improvidence. Just as the owner must be compensated so too must the public coffers not be looted. It is that line of thought that, under Article 40(3), forms the basis for “prompt payment in full, of just compensation to the person” deprived of his property though compulsory acquisition. As was stated by Scott L.J, in relation to compulsory acquisition, in the case of Horn-v- Sunderland Corporation [1941] 2 KB 26,40: “The word “compensation” almost of itself carries the corollary that the loss to the seller must be completely made up to him, on the ground that unless he receives a price that fully equaled his pecuniary detriment, the compensation would not be equivalent to the compulsory sacrifice”. Effectively Lord Scott’s statement gave rise to the unabated proposition that the compensation of compulsorily acquired property be quantified in accordance with the principle of equivalence. A person is entitled to compensation for losses fairly attributed to the taking of his land but not to any greater amount as “fair compensation requires that he should be paid for the value of the land to him, not its value generally or its value to the acquiring authority”: see Director of Buildings and Lands –v- Shun Fung Wouworks Ltd [1995] AC 111,125. We see no reason why the same approach should not be adopted locally. 
The Constitution
 decrees “just compensation” which must be paid promptly and in full. 
The Constitution
 dictates that the compensation be equitable and lawful when the word “just” is applied as according to Black’s Law Dictionary 9th Ed page 881 the word “just” means “legally right; lawful; equitable”. In our view, the only equitable compensation for compulsory acquisition of land should be one which equates restitution. Once the property is acquired and there is direct loss by reason of the acquisition the owner is entitled to be paid the equivalent. One must receive a price equal to his pecuniary detriment; he is not to receive less or more. This can be achieved to the satisfaction of the owner of land by Appeal to the market value of the land.’






29.
In Many v. The Collector (1957 EA 125) it was held as follows:
“
The market value of land as the basis on which compensation must be assessed is the price which a willing vendor might be expected to obtain from a willing purchaser and a willing purchaser is one who although he may be a speculator is not a wild or unreasonable speculator”.






30.
Despite the clarity on what just compensation entails, parties rarely find concurrence on what it amounts to. In a case where parties have submitted starkly different valuation reports, it is upon the tribunal to determine what approach and valuation is as close as possible to put the appellant in the position she was before the acquisition happened.






31.
Whereas the Respondent indicates that the portion of the suit property was valued at Kshs. 3,424,810/- (approximately 0.0231 hectares) which translates to approximately Kshs. 6,894,098/- for the whole portion of the suit property, it is not lost on us that the same parcel of land was valued at Kshs. 10,000,000/- in the year 2016 when the same was offered as a security for a loan facility from Bank of Baroda. This report was availed as part of the Appellant’s evidence and the same was not challenged by the Respondent. We are convinced that while the valuation reports of the Appellant and the Respondent may have been driven by client influence and adjustment heuristics, a valuation conducted prior to the compulsory acquisition for purposes of securing a facility from a bank is closest to the value of that property as at that time.






32.
There is no doubt, therefore, that the unimproved site value of Kshs. 6,894,098/- for the suit property is a gross undervaluation of the land. The Respondent has not mentioned any factors that could explain a depreciation in value of the suit property. In any case, it is the expectation of a property in such an area to have appreciated by some margin in the two years between 2016 and 2018 when the same was gazetted for acquisition. The Respondent has also failed to show the comparison between the suit property and the comparables adopted in the valuation exercise. It should be borne in mind that factors such as size and location play a role in the valuation of a property. In this case, the evidence suggests that the suit property fronts a major road – a factor which contributes positively to a higher value. As stated in Limo v. Commissioner of Lands KLR (E&L) 175:
“
In addition to the matters contained in the schedule to the Land Acquisition Act which a court should consider in assessing compensation to be paid to a person whose land has been compulsorily acquired, courts have tended to take into account the nearness of the land in question to the main town and its nearness to the road access.” Emphasis added.






33.
This was also the position in The Collector v Abdulla Pirmohmed & Others (1958) EA where the court held that the distance of the plots from a main road was a material factor in assessing their value.
2
 A reliable valuation report must indicate clearly all the factors that went into the valuation and if there were any adjustments which must be clearly explained.
2
Page 616.






34.
It is clear to us that none of the valuation reports presented by the Appellant and Respondent can be relied on in regard to the unimproved site value of the suit property. The two reports have failed to make a clear link between the variables relied upon and the suit property in terms of size and location. We are only left with the valuation report dated 14
th
 November 2016 marked “NMW-1” in the Appellant’s further affidavit sworn on 21
st
 June 2024. We are, therefore, of the view that an unimproved site value of Kshs. 10,000,000/- is a fair estimate of the value of the whole portion of the suit property as at the time of publication of a notice of intention to acquire the suit property, which was about a year and half after the suit was valued for purposes of securing a loan facility at Kshs. 10,000,000/-. We have no evidence of any increase in values within this short period. The same has not been pleaded or provided in evidence by any of the parties.






35.
In regard to the developments on the suit property, the Respondent places the value of the developments at Kshs. 41,121,600/=. This sum has been disputed by the Appellant who has provided a counter valuation of Kshs. 59,000,000/-. This is a significant difference. The parties differ on not only how to go about the calculation itself but also the rate of the building cost. Whereas the Respondent adopted the rate of Kshs. 3300/- per square feet for the completed areas of the building and a rate of Kshs. 2000/- per square feet for the incomplete areas, the Appellant relied on the rate of Kshs. 50,000/- per square metre for the whole structure and subtracted the cost of the remaining works which is shown as Kshs. 3,500,000/- without any further evidence. The Respondent’s valuation of the development is transparent and comparable with the value of the building as at 14
th
 November 2016 when the same was valued for purposes of obtaining a loan facility from Bank of Baroda at a value of Kshs. 40,000,000/-. The Respondent did not err in adopting a lower rate for the incomplete part of the building as it is necessary to include adjustments to take into account the construction quality, and any possible depreciation. We, therefore, find no reason to depart from the Respondent’s valuation of the developments.






36.
The Appellant has also been awarded a sum of Kshs. 4,222,800/- towards loss of income. We also find no reason to interfere with this as it takes into account a reasonable period of two years to cushion the Appellant from loss of rental income she would have received during that period from the time the notice of intention to acquire was published until the time of expected taking of possession. This is in compliance with Rule 3(e) of the Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules, 2017.






37.
The Appellant, however, claims a further sum of Kshs. 6,678,969/- for “loan repayment from September 2020 to July 2022.” We find this demand unsupported by law for the reasons that the compensation under Rule 3(e) enunciated above is supposed to take care of any reasonable damages to a project affected person’s business in the transition period. This means that a project affected person should utilize such compensation to continue servicing other obligations arising out their business including servicing loan facilities. If such a project affected person who has been compensated for loss to their income were to be compensated separately through repayment of a loan, the same would no doubt amount to unjust enrichment and would have no basis in law. The Respondent is, however, reminded to promptly pay the compensation as will be ordered to ensure that the Appellant does not suffer any further loss.






38.
The second limb of the issue discussed above is the question whether the Respondent should have invoked Section 122(3) of the 
Land Act
 to request the acquiring authority to acquire the remaining portion of the suit property. It is the Appellant’s case that the remaining portion of the suit property is not economically viable. In this regard, the Appellant relies on the evidence of Christopher N. Omare, a physical planner, who swore an affidavit on 21
st
 June 2024 in support of the case. According to Mr. Omare the acquisition will affect a substantive part of the suit property and the remaining portion which measures approximately 0.0210 hectares will not be economically viable or would not fit the Appellant’s intended use. In his report attached to his affidavit and marked “CNO-1”, Mr. Omare observes as follows:
“
The current use is commercial cum multi dwelling residential units (flats). As such, the developer expects to develop in line with the user. Developing the remainder portion of land in adherence with …planning guidelines is complex if not impossible. This therefore concludes that parcel Title No. Muguga/Gitaru/2437, cannot be developed as intended after the compulsory acquisition is executed.”






39.
Additionally, the Appellant relies on the evidence of M. D. Kamau, a licensed surveyor. It is the evidence of Mr. Kamau through his report annexed to his affidavit sworn on 21
st
 June 2024 that:
“
From the observations made on the ground, it becomes difficult/ impossible to access the remaining portion …from the Highway, not unless there be a provision of an Access Lane to the property from the NAIROBI-NAKURU HIGHWAY.
The remaining portion {0.0210 Ha. (Approximately 0.0520 Acre)} will not be economically viable to the Registered Proprietor in terms of development considering the stringent guidelines from the County Government during the Approvals; which states that “The buildings shall not cover more than 50% of the area of the land or such lesser area as may be prescribed by the County Government Development Control Regulations.”
In this case, the 50% of the remaining area is 0.0105 Ha (0.0260 Acres) which cannot be feasibly developed or approved by the relevant authorities.”






40.
The Appellant’s evidence is uncontroverted that the remaining portion of the suit property would not be economically viable upon severance. We find in favour of the Appellant in this regard and make a finding that the Respondent ought to have instructed the acquiring authority pursuant to Section 122(3) of the 
Land Act
 to acquire the remaining portion of the suit property. The Appellant is entitled to compensation for the suit property as a whole and not a portion of it.






41.
Having reached the above conclusions, we hereby calculate the amount of compensation due to the Appellant for the entire portion of land known as Muguga/Gitaru/2437 measuring 0.0465 Ha as follows:
a.
Area of land acquired - 0.0465 Ha Approx.
b.
The unimproved site value of the land - Kshs. 10,000,000/-
c.
Value of the developments thereon – Kshs. 41,121,600/-
d.
15% disturbance allowance – Kshs. 7,668,240/-
e.
Loss of Rental income – Kshs. 4,222,800/-
f.
The total compensation payable for the land, developments thereon inclusive of 15% disturbance allowance, and loss of rental income - Kshs 63,012,000/=








42.
The above analysis leads to the conclusion that the Appellant’s Appeal has partly succeeded and is hereby allowed in the following terms:
a.
That the award of Kshs. 55,451,170/= is hereby set aside;
b.
That the Appellant is hereby awarded the sum of Kshs. 63,012,000/= as just compensation for acquisition of land known as Muguga/Gitaru/2437 measuring 0.0465 Ha;
c.
Interest on (b) shall accrue at the rate of 12% from the date of this judgement, until paid in full;
d.
Parties shall bear their own costs.






43.
Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
Before court is an application dated 26/7/2023. It was brought under order 51 of the Civil Procedure Rules section 51(2) 
Advocates Act
 CAP 16, order 7 of the advocates (remuneration) order under section 48 of CAP 16. It sought judgment/decree for Kshs. 268,940/- and interest at the rate of 14% per annum from 4/2/2015.






2.
The application is supported by the grounds on the face of it and the supporting affidavit of Kinyanjui Theuri of even date. It was averred that the bill of costs had been taxed at Kshs 268,940/= and the respondent had continually failed to pay the legal fees. The applicant stated that the respondent was facing liquidity issues and the recovery of the funds was in jeopardy. That if the orders sought are not granted the applicant/advocate would be highly prejudiced.






3.
The application was opposed by the respondent in replying affidavit sworn by sylvia makassy on 6/12/2023. It was contended that the although the bill of costs had been taxed, no interest was awarded. That the decision of the taxing master was final and should not be disturbed pursuant to section 51(2) of the 
Advocates Act
. That the respondent had not refused to pay the applicant rather there were other costs the respondent was paying.






4.
The parties did not file their respective submissions. I have considered the contestations of all the parties in the pleadings on record. The main issue for determination is whether judgment should be entered in terms of the certificate of costs.






5.
Section 51(2) of the 
Advocates Act
 Cap 16 (Laws of Kenya) empowers the court to enter judgment on taxed costs in favour of an advocate. It provides that: -
“
The certificate of the taxing officer by whom any bill has been taxed shall, unless it is set aside or altered by the Court, be final as to the amount of the costs covered thereby, and the Court may make such order in relation thereto as it thinks fit, including, in a case where the retainer is not disputed, an order that judgment be entered for the sum certified to be due with costs.”






6.
In view of the foregoing, once a taxing officer issues a certificate of costs under subsection (2), it becomes final unless the court sets it aside or alters it. Consequently, judgment can be entered based on the amount specified in the certificate of taxation.






7.
In the present case, the court has not identified any valid reasons to set aside the Certificate of taxation issued by the taxing officer. Given that the Certificates has neither been altered nor set aside, the court is obligated to grant the application for entry of judgment.






8.
In Lubulellah & Associates Advocates vs N. K. Brothers Limited [2014] eKLR, the court reiterated this position as follows: -
“
The law is very clear that once a taxing master has taxed the costs, issued a Certificate of costs and there is no reference against his ruling or there has been a ruling and a determination made and not set aside and/or altered, no other action would be required from the court save to enter judgment. An applicant is not required to file suit for the recovery of costs.






9.
In this case, it is not disputed that the certificate of costs was issued on 17/7/2023 for a sum of Kshs 268,940/-. The said amount has not been set aside by the court by way of reference. The only issue in dispute is whether interest should be awarded.






10.
Rule 7 of the Advocates Remuneration Order allows an advocate to charge interest on his costs and disbursements as follows: -
“
An advocate may charge interest at 14 per cent per annum on his disbursements and costs, whether by scale or otherwise, from the expiration of one month from the delivery of his bill to the client, provided that such claim for interest is raised before the amount of the bill shall have been paid or tendered in full.”






11.
The rate of interest which an advocate may charge is set at 14% per annum from the expiration of one month from the delivery of the bill to the client. I find that the advocate herein is entitled to interest. There was no evidence to show when the fee-note was delivered to the respondent. However, it is clear that the bill was delivered on 8/2/2019. Interest will run 30day from that date.






12.
Accordingly, I find merit in the application and the same is allowed in the following terms: -
a.
Judgment be and is hereby entered in favour of the Advocate in the sum of Kshs. 268,940/- together with interest thereon at fourteen (14%) per cent per annum from 30/3/2019.
b.
Costs of this application be awarded to the Advocate.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The Appellant was charged with the offence of rape contrary to Section 3(1) (a) (c) as read with Section 3(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The particulars of the offence were that on 31
st
 October 2022, at [particulars withheld], within Murang’a County, the Appellant intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of SN without her consent. In the alternative, the Appellant was charged with committing an indecent act with an adult contrary to Section 11(a) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The particulars of the offence were that on 31
st
 October 2022, at [particulars withheld], within Murang’a County, the Appellant intentionally touched the vagina of SN with his penis against her will.






2.
After conviction, the appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He was aggrieved by his conviction and sentence, hence this appeal.






3.
He filed his grounds of appeal on 20
th
 September 2023 and subsequently filed amended grounds of appeal on 13
th
 March 2024, together with written submissions.






4.
This being a first appeal to the High Court, I am reminded of my duty to revisit the evidence presented before the trial court and to subject it to a thorough and exhaustive analysis to draw my own independent conclusions bearing in mind that unlike the trial court, I did not have the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. This duty has been crystalized in a long line of authorities, including Okeno V Republic, [1972] EA 32; Njoroge V Republic, [1987] KLR 99; Patrick V Republic, [2005] 2 KLR 162, among others.






5.
I have carefully considered the grounds of appeal, the entire evidence presented before the trial court and the written submissions filed by both the appellant and the respondent.






6.
I have also read the judgment of the learned trial magistrate. Having done so, I find that the issue for determination is whether the prosecution established the offence of rape contrary to Section 3(1) as read with Section 3(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 to the required standard of proof beyond any reasonable doubt.






7.
This court has re-evaluated the evidence in this appeal in light of the submissions made on this appeal. Section 3(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 states that a person commits the offence of rape if;

he or she intentionally and unlawfully commits an act which causes penetration with his or her genital organs;
(b)
the other person does not consent to the penetration; or
(c)
the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind.”






8.
The main ingredients of the offence of rape created in Section 3 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 include intentional and unlawful penetration of the genital organ of one person by another, coupled with the absence of consent. The prosecution was, therefore, required to establish penetration, lack of consent, and that the appellant was the perpetrator of the act.






9.
In her testimony, the complainant stated that the appellant, whom she had met and been in touch with for a few weeks, had invited her over to his cousin's house, where he locked the house and raped her twice. PW3, the Clinical officer, stated that the complainant was treated at 10 pm on the same date she complained of having been raped while the P3 form was filled 2 days later.






10.
The investigating officer also testified and told the court that the incident was reported on the same night and that the complainant was escorted to the hospital for examination. The investigating officer visited the scene and confirmed that the occupier, who is known to the appellant, recorded a statement. According to the investigating officer, the appellant had a spare key for the house and had not been at work for two days, including the date complained of.






11.
The complainant was recalled twice in this case; the cross-examination did not shake her testimony. The appellant confirmed that he and the complainant were known to each other and had been in contact. He was a person well-known to the complainant.






12.
On the element of penetration, the general rule is that even without considering the presence or otherwise of medical evidence, an offence of this nature can be proved by oral evidence of a victim of rape or circumstantial evidence. This position is fortified by the holding of the Court of Appeal in 
Martin Nyongesa Wanyonyi vs Republic Criminal Appeal No. 661 of 2010
 (Eldoret), citing 
Kassim Ali v Republic Criminal Appeal No. 84 of 2005
 (Mombasa), where the court stated that:
“
The absence of medical evidence to support the fact of rape is not decisive as the fact of rape can be proved by oral evidence of a victim or circumstantial evidence.”
In the present appeal, penetration was proved by the complainant’s evidence which was corroborated by that of PW6. The Appellant did not challenge this evidence and this court finds that penetration was proved to the required standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.






13.
The complainant testified that she told the appellant that she had a boyfriend, and thus, she did not want to have sexual intercourse with the appellant. He then pulled her back on the bed, strangled her, and raped her twice. He then took videos of her naked and threatened to expose them on social media and send them to her boyfriend.






14.
In the case of Republic v Oyier [1985] KLR 353 the Court of Appeal held that;
“
1.
The lack of consent is an essential element of the crime of rape. The mens rea in rape is primarily an intention and not a state of mind. The mental element is to have intercourse without consent or not caring whether the woman consented or not.
2.
To prove the mental element required in rape, the prosecution had to prove that the complainant physically resisted or, if she did not, that her understanding and knowledge were such that she was not in a position to decide whether to consent or resist.
3.
Where a woman yields through fear of death, or through duress, it is rape and it is no excuse that the woman consented first, if the offence was afterwards committed by force or against her will; nor is it any excuse that she consented after the fact.”






15.
It’s the complainant’s case that she did not consent to the sexual acts. According to the Proviso to Section 42 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, “a person is said to consent if he or she agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice.” In Republic v. Oyier [1985] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held as follows: -
“
The lack of consent is an essential element of the crime of rape. The mens rea in rape is primarily an intention and not a state of mind. The mental element is to have intercourse without consent or not caring whether the woman consented or not.
To prove the mental element required in rape, the prosecution had to prove that the complainant physically resisted or, if she did not, that her understanding and knowledge were such that she was not in a position to decide whether to consent or resist.”






16.
This court has carefully considered the evidence tendered by the prosecution and the defence raised by the appellant. No gap was left by the fact that the witness referred to by the appellant did not testify. The evidence on record disapproved the alibi defence, and the prosecution fully discharged the burden of proof that the appellant was the perpetrator of the sexual assault.






17.
This court, therefore, holds that the prosecution established to the required standard of proof that it was the Appellant who sexually assaulted the complainant. The conviction was proper and was supported by the law and evidence.






18.
I will now briefly turn to the sentence. Section 3 (3) of the Sexual Offenses Act provides that a person guilty of the offence of rape is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may be enhanced to imprisonment for life. The appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The accused was treated as a first offender, and his mitigation was recorded and considered as captured in the proceedings.






19.
The Supreme Court has now given fresh guidance on minimum sentences under the Act in Republic V Joshua Gichuki Mwangi Petiti
on No. E018 of 2023
. The court held that where a sentence is set in statute, the legislature has already determined the course unless it's declared unconstitutional.






20.
The learned magistrate exercised discretion in sentencing and, in doing so, meted an appropriate sentence, which was lawful. It was neither harsh nor excessive.






21.
In his submissions, the appellant requested that this court consider the time he had spent in custody before his sentence. The court record shows that the appellant was arrested on November 18, 2022, and was in custody during his trial. It is evident from the trial court’s record that in passing the sentence, the learned trial magistrate did not order the time the appellant had spent in custody to be taken into account when computing his sentence.






22.
In compliance with the proviso to Section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, order that the period of about ten months the appellant had spent in custody before the date of his sentence shall be deducted from his sentence.






23.
The upshot is that the appeal on conviction is hereby dismissed. The sentence is set aside and substituted thereof with the sentence outlined in paragraph 
22
 of this judgment.






24.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
Vide a Motion on Notice dated 31/7/2024, the decree-holder applied under Order 23 Rules 1(1) and (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules to garnishee several accounts belonging to the six (6) garnishees. The same was meant to satisfy a sum of Kshs. 18,844,480/60 alleged to be outstanding on the decree issued by this Court.






2.
The application was supported by the affidavit of Paul Maina Gathara sworn on 31/7/2024 wherein he detailed the history of the claim. The claim arose out of an Arbitral Award that was recognized by this Court and a decree for Kshs. 62,560,708 issued on 10/11/2022. Out of the decretal sum, a total sum of Kshs. 43,286,554/20 had been paid. There was outstanding a sum of Kshs. 18,844,480/60. It was believed that the garnishees held funds in the various accounts specified that was capable of satisfying the said amount.






3.
On 19/8/2024, this Court issued a garnishee nisi against the cited accounts. The same was served upon all the garnishees and the respondent who filed various responses.






4.
The respondent opposed the Motion vide a replying affidavit sworn on 26/8/2024. In it, it was deposed that the accounts of Stanbic Bank, the 5
th
 garnishee, should be spared as there was an earlier order excluding the said accounts to enable the respondent continue operating. That the financial position of the respondent was not good and a financial statement to that effect was produced.






5.
The 1
st
 garnishee (Equity Bank) contended that it had been discharged from the proceedings vide an order of 19/3/2024. For that reason, it failed to disclose any bank statement on the accounts garnished.






6.
The 2
nd
 garnishee (Standard Chartered Bank) filed an affidavit sworn on 21/8/2024 by which it disclosed holding a sum of Kshs. 383,522/75 and US$1,214.31 only. Learned Counsel for the 2
nd
 garnishee sought costs of Kshs. 50,000 for this application.






7.
The 3
rd
 garnishee (Co-operative Bank) disclosed that it held a total sum of Kshs. 645,205/80. Counsel for the 3
rd
 garnishee applied for costs of Kshs. 100,000 for these proceedings.






8.
The 4
th
 garnishee did not file any response while the 5
th
 garnishee admitted a sum of only Kshs. 93,993.






9.
On its part, the 6
th
 respondent admitted to holding a sum of only Kshs. 350. Its advocate asked for Kshs. 30,000 as costs.






10.
Mr. Maina, Learned Counsel for the decree-holder submitted that the 4
th
 garnishee should have the order nisi made absolute against it as it was properly served. That the 5
th
 garnishee (Stanbic) had transferred funds to some fixed deposit accounts and should be made to disclose the same.






11.
I have considered the parties contestations. Garnishee proceedings are proceedings whereby a 3
rd
 party who is believed to owe a judgment-debtor is compelled to pay over that debt to satisfy the decree standing against the judgment-debtor. The law requires such 3
rd
 Party, the garnishee, to appear in court to either admit or dispute the debt. It is in such appearance that the garnishee has the opportunity to either dispute that he owes the judgment-debtor or clarify the extent of his indebtedness.






12.
If the garnishee does not dispute owing or fails to appear as directed, the court is entitled to make the order nisi absolute and order or direct execution against the garnishee for the amount claimed. This is the effect of Order 23 Rule 4 which provides that:-
“
4.
If the Garnishee does not dispute the debt due or claimed to be due from his to the judgment-debtor, or, if he does not appear upon the day of hearing named in an order nisi, then the court may order execution against, the person and goods of the Garnishee to levy the amount due from him, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree, together with the costs of the Garnishee proceedings….”






13.
In Ngaywa Ngigi & Kibet Advocates –vs- Invesco Assurance Co. Ltd; Diamond Trust Bank (Garnishee)[2020] eKLR, it was held:-
“I agree with the contention of counsel for the Applicant that in terms of Order 23 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules, if the garnishee does not dispute the debt due or claimed to be due from him to the judgment-debtor, or if he does not appear upon the day of hearing named in the order nisi, then the court may order execution against the person and goods of the garnishee to levy the amount due from him, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree together with the costs of the Garnishee proceedings, and the order absolute shall be in Form No. 17 or 18 of the Appendix A, as the case may be. It is the position of the law that in garnishee proceedings the garnishee banks are only required to appear before the court to acknowledge or dispute the debts. In the present case, the garnishee bank did not appear or file a response and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I find that they acknowledged that the respondent held accounts with them and it was not necessary for court to question them and cross-examine them as they did not have any objections in relation to the attachment”.






14.
The foregoing is the correct proposition of the law. That in the event a garnishee who is served with an order nisi, fails to dispute the debt or appear in court and explain the extent of his indebtedness, an order absolute will be made against him and execution ordered accordingly. The basis for this is that; a decree-holder alleges that he believes that the garnishee owes or holds funds for the judgment-debtor which is sufficient to satisfy the unsatisfied decree. Under sections 107, 108 and 112 of the 
Evidence Act
, the evidentiary burden of proof shifts to the garnishee to deny or confirm that fact. Failure to deny the same results in the pendulum of the burden of proof to the garnishee and the liability to settle the claim thereby arises.






15.
I am aware of some decisions to the effect that the garnishee’s property is not to be attached as it is not the garnishee that is to answer the decree. To my mind, that is misreading the law. A decree is ordinarily directed at the judgment-debtor who is the primary obligor to settle the same. After failing, the law allows the decree-holder to trace the judgment-debtor’s funds to the hands of the garnishee.






16.
This tracing of the judgment-debtor’s funds to the hands of a garnishee is in 2 stages. The first stage is by issuance of the garnishee order nisi. Here the court makes the order exparte freezing the judgment-debtor’s properties or funds alleged to be in the hands of the garnishee. That order ordinarily directs the garnishee to hold on to those properties and or funds for purposes of satisfying the decree.






17.
The second stage, where now the liability of the garnishee arises is, the garnishee is required by law either to dispute the debt allegedly owed to the judgment-debtor or to appear in court to explain the extent of his liability. Failure to do either amounts to an admission on the assertions in the order nisi. That is when the court will make the order absolute as against the garnishee.






18.
It should be recalled the Order 23 Rule 4 states that:-
“
…then the court may order execution against the person or goods of the Garnishee to levy the amount due from him; …”
In this regard, I find and hold that once a garnishee is served with a garnishee order nisi and fails to dispute the debt or appear to explain the extent of his liability, the order absolute will be made against him. Under Appendix A Form No. 17 or 18, the order is to be executed against the garnishee or his property. The reason for this is that by virtue of Section 112 of the 
Evidence Act
, it is the garnishee who is in the know of the extent of his indebtedness to the judgment-debtor who, of course is adamant of not settling the decree.






19.
In the present case, 6 garnishees were involved. Four of them disputed the debt but gave the extent of their indebtedness as follows:-






20.
(a)
Standard Chartered - Kshs. 383,522/75 - US$ 1,214.31
(b)
Cooperative Bank - Kshs. 645,205/80
(c)
Stanbic Bank - Kshs. 93,993
(d)
National Bank - Kshs. 350
(e)
Equity Bank - Kshs. 689,237/30






21.
I order that the said garnishees do release to the decree-holder the amounts held less Kshs. 30,000 each for costs. As for National Bank, the costs are to be levied against the respondent.






22.
As regards Equity Bank and NCBA, they were duly served with the decree nisi but did not dispute the debt. The orders previously made for discharge was in respect of different garnishee proceedings and not the present one. Accordingly, the two banks are liable to settle the balance of the decretal sum.






23.
As regards the contention by the respondent on its financial position, this Court had given the respondent time to put its financial position to order. This was between March 2024 and July 2024 as it had pleaded in an earlier application. That was sufficient time to make the required arrangements and settle the decree. Decrees must be settled. Public entities must learn that once they engage in private contracts they must play by the rules.






24.
Accordingly, I allow the application and make the garnishee order nisi absolute as follows:-
(a)
Standard Chartered - Kshs. 383,522/75
- US$ 1,214/31
(b)
Cooperative Bank - Kshs. 645,205/80
(c)
Stanbic Bank - Kshs. 93,993/=
(d)
National Bank - Kshs. 350/=
(e)
Equity Bank - Kshs. 689,237/30
(f)
The sums in (a) (b) (c) and (e) above to be less Kshs. 30,000/= costs. The costs of National Bank be borne by the respondent.
(g)
The balance of the sum claimed in the Motion dated 31/7/2024 to be paid by NCBA.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an appeal against the Conviction and sentence of the Hon. S. W. Mathenge, SRM, in Bondo, PM’s Court, Sexual Offence No. E065 of 2022, judgment delivered on 19/5/2023 and sentence on 30/5/2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant, Tobias Omondi, was charged before the lower court with the offence of Defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, No. 3 of 2006. That on 25/11/2022 at around 17.30 hrs at [particulars withheld] Centre, Nyaguda sub-location, South Sakwa location, Nyangoma Division, Bondo sub-county, Siaya County, he intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of E.A.O, a child aged 13 years.






2.
He faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the 
Sexual offences Act
, No. 3 of 2006. That on 25/11/2022, at around 17.30 hrs at [particulars withheld] Centre, Nyaguda sub location, South Sakwa location, Nyangoma Division, Bondo sub-county, Siaya County, he intentionally and unlawfully touched the vagina of E. A. O a child aged 13 years with his penis.






3.
The Appellant was tried and convicted of the main charge. On 30/5/2023, he was sentenced to serve 20 years imprisonment. He has moved to this court on appeal and raised the following grounds of appeal:-
1.
That the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt and the conviction went against the evidence adduced.
2.
That the trial court failed to observe that the prosecution did not prove penetration ingredient.
3.
That the trial court erred in law and facts by basing appellant conviction on a contradictory evidence of prosecution witnesses.
4.
That the trial court failed to observe that the prosecution never proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt and conviction went against the weight of evidence.
5.
That the trial magistrate failed to comply with the provision of Section 36 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, No. 3 of 2006.
6.
He pleads that this appeal be allowed entirely. This appeal is opposed by the Respondent.






4.
In the case of Okenov R [1972] EA 32, the Court of Appeal spelt out the jurisdiction of a first appellate court. That it is to re-assess, re-evaluate and re-analyse the evidence tendered to come to its conclusions. This court must therefore consider the whole evidence before the trial court.






5.
From the record of the proceedings, PW1 was Eunice Adhiambo Onyango, 14, and in grade 4, whose evidence was that on 25/11/2022 at about 5.30 pm, she was headed to her father at Wich Lum market when the appellant confronted her. That later, appellant went to where she was playing with her siblings. He gave her 5/= which she used in buying biscuits. He later returned and gave her 100/=. He then led her to a house wherein he closed her eyes and nose and mouth with a cloth. He made her kneel, removed her clothes and panty. He then lay on her by force and put his male part in her female part. That another man came and found them in the bathroom where they were but accused said he was urinating. Other neighbours gathered as the chief was called. That people wanted to lynch the appellant. They were taken to Amoyo Police Station and she was taken to Hospital.






6.
George Onyango Oloo was PW2. He is father of PW1. His evidence was that PW1 was born on 16/8/2009 as per the certificate of birth (PEXH1). He recalled that on 25/11/2022, at about 8.00 pm, he was informed that PW1 had been raped at a neighbour’s house. He found a crowd baying to assault the perpetrator. He identified the man as Tobias Omondi, a fisherman at Wich Lum. That the appellant admitted and told him it was the devil which got him. They took him to the police station as the child was taken to hospital.






7.
The Assistant chief, Edwin Juma Owuor was PW3. His evidence was that he had received a distress call and on reaching the scene, found a crowd gathered with a suspect who admitted defiling the child. He assisted in taking the man to the police station. And PW4 Stephen Okwiri, a clinical officer at Bondo sub-county hospital gave evidence that he examined the child on 26/11/2022 and filled both the P3 form and the PCR forms. He noted that on examination, the inner parts of PW1 had blood stains and whitish discharge. She had pain on lower abdomen and lower limbs. Her hymen was freshly broken and she was bleeding from the genital area. He formed the opinion that there was evidence of defilement. He produced the relevant exhibits including the P3 form, the PRC form, treatment sheet and the lab test form.






8.
The last prosecution witness was PC Edwin Ogik PW5. He is the one who received the appellant from the members of public. He also took the witness statements.






9.
When the appellant was put to his own defence, he gave a defence on oath and testified that he is a fisherman. That on the material date, as he waited for his boat, a motor cycle appeared and he was stopped. He was then locked up by people who wanted to kill him. He was later moved to the police station and charged in court. He denied knowing the complainant, nor defiling her. He called no witness.






10.
The parties herein have canvassed this appeal by way of written submissions. The appellant has submitted that there was no independent eye witness who testified in court. relying on Abanga Alias Onyangov R, Criminal Appeal No. 32/1990, the appellant submitted that the circumstantial evidence do not point at him. Also that court did not take into account his mitigation and proceeded to sentence him to a mandatory minimum sentence which was unjustifiable, discriminative and unfair Julius Kitsao Manyeso–VS- R, Malindi,CR. APP.NO. 12 OF 2021. He pleaded in the alternative, for a sentence that would be for rehabilitation purposes.






11.
The prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that the prosecution witnesses proved the three elements of the offence Daniel Wambugu Mainav R, [2018] eKLR ie age of the complainant, penetration and identification of the assailant. And that this appeal be dismissed.






12.
I have considered this case, the proceedings and the submissions that the parties have made. Section 8 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, provides:-
A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.”






13.
The above definition gives the essential elements of the offence of defilement which the prosecution is under a duty to prove to sustain a conviction for the offence of defilement. The case of Daniel Wambugu Maina v R, [2018] eKLR, relied on by the prosecution confirms that the three elements are:-
i.
Age of the complainant
ii.
Proof of penetration
iii.
Identity of the perpetrator






14.
From the record of the proceedings it was the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3 that the complainant was born on 16/8/2009 and was therefore 13 years, old at the time of the commission of the offence and 14 years as at the time of giving evidence. The certificate of birth of the complainant (PEXH1) was produced as an exhibit in this matter. With this evidence, this court is convinced that the prosecution duly proved the age of the complainant and that she was a child at the time of the commission of the offence.






15.
On the second element of proof of the fact of penetration, again the prosecution provided the evidence of PW1 that on the material date and the time, the appellant followed her into room, removed her clothes and under pant, before inserting his male organ into her female organ. There was also the evidence of PW4 that he examined the complainant on the same date and found that her hymen was freshly broken, she had blood stains in her inner parts which also had whitish discharge. She had pain on lower abdomen and lower limbs and she was bleeding from her genital area. This witness formed the opinion that there was evidence of defilement. He produced as exhibits the P3 form, PRC form and the treatment sheet which he filled upon the examination.






16.
The evidence of those two witnesses leave no doubt that the prosecution laid sufficient evidence to prove the fact of penetration. I so find.






17.
The last element subject of proof is the one of identification of the perpetrator. Again, several witnesses gave evidence that relate to this. According to PW1, the appellant had approached her earlier in the day and given her Kshs5/= which she used to buy biscuits which she took together with her siblings. That the appellant again approached her and gave her Ksh100/= before leading her to the room where he defiled her. This incident took place during the day at about 5.30 pm and clearly, PW1 had the opportunity to see the appellant well. And this witness was forthright enough to confirm that she was able to identify the appellant well even though she had not known him before this date.






18.
And then there is the evidence of PW3, the Area Assistant Chief, that on being called and informed of the incident, he rushed to the scene where he found both the appellant and the complainant as the appellant was under arrest by members of the public who wanted to lynch the appellant and that he is in fact the one who saved the appellant. And farther, that the appellant admitted the act only saying he had been misled by the devil. The same evidence was given by PW2, the father of the complainant who also found the appellant still under arrest with the gathered crowd baying for his life. It is these two witnesses, who apparently saved the appellant from the crowd and took him to the police station.






19.
I have considered the evidence of these three witnesses and I am convinced that they corroborate each other on the fact that the appellant was actually caught in the act, detained by the gathered crowd and later escorted to the police station. It is true that the man who allegedly caught the appellant in the act did not give evidence as a prosecution witness. The failure of this witness to give evidence is however, not fatal to the case of the prosecution, particularly with the evidence of PW1 that it was the appellant and no-one else who defiled her.






20.
In the submissions of the appellant, he has referred this court to the cases of Abanga–VS- R, and Sawev R (both supra), that circumstantial evidence should be such that the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused.






21.
Taking into account the above circumstances of this case, this court is convinced that the same point to no one but the appellant as the person who defiled the complainant. I am therefore convinced that the prosecution duly proved the identity of the appellant as one who defiled the complainant.






22.
I have otherwise considered the defence of the appellant. The appellant did not challenge the evidence of PW1 at all on how he lured her with ksh5/= and also with 100/= before defiling her. He also did not challenge the evidence of PW2 and PW3 on how he was arrested and taken to the police station. His defence that he was innocently arrested by members of the public and taken to the police station, without any reason, is unbelievable. Unbelievable in view of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that he was in fact caught in the act. The appellant also called no witness, leaving his defence devoid of any corroboration. I sincerely do not find any merit in the defence of the appellant. I dismiss it.






23.
Section 8 (3) of the Act, states;
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of 16 and 18 years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than 15 years.”






24.
The record of the proceedings of the lower court clearly show that prior to being sentenced, the appellant was accorded the opportunity to mitigate and he accordingly stated;






25.
It is my first offence. I appreciate the court on how it has proceeded. I will not repeat the offence. I pray for forgiveness. I have 9 children. They are all mine. One is in form 4. All in school and I am afraid of what will happen to them. Three of them are orphans. My wife is unwell. I pray court’s sentence be lenient for the sake of my children.






26.
The court then proceeded to obtain a probation officers, pre-sentence report. And in passing the sentence, the court noted,






27.
I have considered the offence, mitigation, presentence report and time spent by accused in custody, I sentence accused to serve twenty years. Right of Appeal 14 days.






28.
The above clearly show that the sentence passed by the trial court was proper and legal and took into account the circumstances of the case and the mitigation of the appellant. In effect, the court clearly followed the guidelines of the Supreme Court in the MURUATETU case. The sentence therefore was not meted out as a mandatory minimum sentence. The appeal of the appellant on sentence therefore fails.






29.
In the circumstance, I am convinced that the prosecution duly discharged its burden of proof and proved the case against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt as required by the law Woolmingtonv DPP [1935] AC).






30.
The appeal of the appellant filed herein on 5/6/2023 totally lacks any merit. I dismiss the same wholly. It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
Before me is an application by way of Notice of Motion dated 19
th
 July 2023 filed by the applicants through counsel Kimondo Gachoka & Company Advocates under Section 1A, 1B, 3, 3A and 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 (Cap.21) and Order 22 Rule 22 and Order 42 Rule 6, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rules 1 and 3 of the 
Civil Procedure Rules
 2010, seeking the following orders:-
1.
(Spent).
2.
(Spent).
3.
(Spent).
4.
That the court be pleased to stay execution and proceedings of the judgment from Voi 
CMCC
 Civil Suit No. E046 of 2020 pending hearing and determination of this appeal herein.
5.
That the costs of this application abide the outcome of the appeal.






2.
The application has grounds on the face of the Notice of Motion that judgment had been delivered in Voi 
CMCC
 No. E046 of 2020 on 5
th
 May 2023 and that Voi Civil Appeal No. E018 of 2023 had been filed; and that if the stay orders sought herein are not granted the applicant will suffer substantial loss as the decretal amount paid might not be repaid in case the appeal is successful, that the appeal has high chances of success.






3.
The application was filed with a supporting affidavit sworn on 19
th
 July 2023 by Nannungi Mariat Advocate for the applicant, amplifying the grounds of the application.






4.
The application has been opposed through a replying affidavit sworn by Esther Njeri Waweru who was previously a minor but now an adult, on 27
th
 July 2023, in which it was deponed that the application is incompetent, misconceived and mainly meant to further delay payment of the fruits of the judgment to her and should thus be dismissed with costs.






5.
The application was canvassed through written submissions. In this regard, I have perused and considered the submissions filed by Kimondo Gachoka & Company Advocates for the applicants, as well as the submissions filed by S. N. Ngare & Company Advocates for the respondent.






6.
This being an application for stay of execution of judgment or decree pending determination of appeal, it is governed by the provisions of Order 42 Rule 6 of the 
Civil Procedure Rules
 especially Rule 6(2).






7.
From the grounds of appeal herein, I note that the appeal is on the quantum of damages awarded.






8.
The first consideration is whether the4 application was filed without unreasonable delay. Judgment herein was delivered on 5
th
 May 2023 and this application filed on 19
th
 July 2023, a period slightly more than two (2) months. In my view, taking into account all the circumstances of the matter, this application was filed without unreasonable delay.






9.
As to whether the applicant will suffer substantial loss if the stay orders sought are not granted, I note that general damages of Kshs. 300,000/= were awarded by the trial court, together with special damages. The beneficiary of the judgment was a minor, but now an adult.






10.
In my view, this being a monetary award and the grounds of appeal being on quantum of damages, the applicant will only suffer substantial loss if the whole amount is paid to the respondent now, and then not recovered if the appeal succeeds. I will thus grant stay orders subject to payment of part of the decretal amount to the respondent.






11.
Coming now to provision of security by the applicants, I note that the applicants have not offered to provide any security for grant of stay orders, but in my view, the part payment of the decretal amount to be ordered by this court, will be sufficient security.






12.
Consequently, I allow the application and order as follows:-
i.
I grant stay of execution of judgment or decree herein as requested pending determination of the appeal filed.
ii.
The stay of execution orders granted herein are subject to the applicants/appellants paying part of the decretal amount Kshs. 140,000/= to the respondent through counsel within 45 days from today.
iii.
In default of (ii) above, the stay orders herein granted will automatically lapse and be of no effect.
iv.
The costs of this application will abide the decision in the appeal.

Respondent










Judgment










1.
The Appellant is a registered taxpayer involved in the manufacture and export of aluminum kitchenware in the sub-Saharan region.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, and is the Kenya Revenue Authority charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.






3.
The Tribunal issued orders directing the Appellant to object to the Respondent’s rejection of its refund claims within 30 days of a Judgment delivered on 15
th
 September, 2023.






4.
The Appellant objected as directed on 6
th
 October, 2023.






5.
The Respondent issued its response on 13
th
 October, 2023.






6.
The Appellant being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s response, filed a Notice of Appeal dated 8
th
 November, 2023.






The Appeal


7.
The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 22
nd
 November, 2023 and filed on the same date:
i.
That the Respondent erred in law and fact by rejecting the Applicant's VAT refund application dated 26
th
 of October 2011 and the 10
th
 of May 2012 amounting to Kshs. 26,781,163.00 in a decision dated 7
th
 April, 2015.
ii.
That the issue of the Appellants VAT refund claim had been addressed in TAT Appeal No. 500 of 2022, Narcol Aluminum Rolling Mills Limited v Commissioner Legal Services and Board Coordination wherein the dispute at hand was the Respondent’s rejection of the Appellant’s refund claim as they were erroneously demanding Certificate of Exports to process the Appellant’s claim. The Tribunal ultimately determined the case in favor of the Appellant and ordered that the Appellant lodge an objection against the Respondent's decision dated 7
th
 April 2015.
iii.
That while the Appellant lodged the objection within 30 days as per the Tribunal's directives, the Respondent in its decision dated 13
th
 October 2023 have indicated their inability to comply with the Tribunal’s Judgment as the refund decisions are no longer subject to objections with effect from 1
st
 July, 2023 in line with the 2023 Finance Act which amended Section 2 of the Tax Procedure Act and excluded a refund decision from the definition of a tax decision subject to objection process.
iv.
That the Appellant is thus appealing to this Honorable Tribunal to determine conclusively the issue relating to the Respondent’s rejection of the refunds application due to the fact that though at the time of filing the TAT Appeal No. 500 of 2022, Narcol Aluminum Rolling Mills Limited v Commissioner Legal Services and Board Coordination a refund decision was both objectionable and an appealable decision, the same had actually changed status to only appealable decision at the time the Judgment was delivered.








Appellant’s Case


8.
The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents:
i.
The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated and filed on 22
nd
 November, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.
ii.
The Appellant’s Supplementary List of documents dated and filed on 8
th
 April, 2024.
iii.
The Appellant’s written submissions dated 26
th
 March, 2024 and filed on 27
th
 March, 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.






9.
That the Appellant manufactures and exports aluminum kitchenware in the sub-Saharan region. The exportation of the aforementioned goods is zero rated, hence putting the Appellant in a perpetual credit position.






10.
That the Appellant applied for the refunds amounting to Kshs. 9,479,413.66 for the period of February to May 2011 on 26
th
 October 2011 in line with the existing Regulations at the time.






11.
That the Appellant similarly applied for the refunds amounting to Kshs. 17,301,749.88 for the period of June - December 2011 on 10
th
 May. 2012.






12.
That the Respondent rejected the VAT refund claims vide a letter dated 7
th
 April, 2015 on the grounds that the validity of the Appellant's exports could not be verified through the “Simba”2005 system.






13.
That this current Appeal is indeed not the genesis of the Appellant's woes with the Respondent, nor is its first Appeal before this Tribunal in relation to VAT refund issue. That indeed, the Appellant had earlier sought the intervention of this Tribunal in TAT Appeal No 500 of 2022, Narcol Aluminum Rolling Mills Limited v Commissioner of Legal Services & Board Coordination when the Respondent herein rejected the Appellant’s VAT refund application on the 7
th
 April, 2015.






14.
The Appellant briefly highlighted the events that transpired in Appeal No 500 of 2022 as below.






15.
That the Appellant applied for à refund amounting to Kshs. 9,479,413.66 for the period of February to May 2011 on 26
th
 October, 2011. That similarly, the Appellant applied for refunds amounting to Kshs. 17,301,749.88 for the period of June - December 2011 on 10
th
 May, 2012.






16.
That to the Appellant's great dismay, the Respondent rejected the refund claims on 7
th
 April, 2015 stating that the validity of the Appellant's exports could not be verified through the ""Simba"" 2005 system. That it should be noted that the rejection letter was issued 4 years after the refund applications were made.






17.
That the period following the issuance of the rejection decision was punctuated with correspondences and physical meetings between the Appellant and the Respondent with the Appellant endeavoring to provide as much information as possible.






18.
That on 26
th
 September, 2017, the Respondent once again wrote to the Appellant elaborating that the refund claim was disallowed as there was no online export confirmation. That the Respondent further directed the Appellant to reach out to its sister Department, Customs and Border Control, to generate Certificates of Exports (COE) or exit reports from the Simba system.






19.
That it should be noted that as per the Respondent’s letter dated 26
th
 September, 2017, the Appellant was under the impression that the Respondent was still considering its refund claim. That this was not a naive assertion of the Appellant as in the letter dated 26
th
 September, 2017, the Respondent led the Appellant to believe that once the Certificates of Export and additional documents requested were presented, the Respondent would consider the Appellant's refund claim.






20.
That relying on the Respondent's directives, the Appellant engaged the Customs and Border Control Department with the view of obtaining the Certificates of Export. That this proved to be a tiring and arduous task with the Appellant expelling a significant amount of energy and resources into the acquisition of the same.






21.
That the Appellant's unfortunate predicament was aggravated by the fact that the requirement for the provision of Certificate of Export was introduced as per Guidelines published on 12
th
 April, 2013 providing for validation of exported goods subject to zero rating, refunds and rebates. That crucially, the Guidelines were introduced more than 4 years after the VAT refund claim was made by the Appellant.






22.
That this meant that the Respondent, in its letters dated 7
th
 April, 2015 and 26
th
 September, 2017, was retrospectively applying the Guidelines introduced on 12
th
 April, 2013 to send the Appellant on a wild goose chase requiring it to acquire Certificates of Export for its refund claims to be considered. That this was despite the fact that at the point of making the refund application, the provision of the Certificates of Export was not necessary.






23.
That indeed, the acquisition of the Certificates of Export proved to be a difficult endeavor owing to the inefficiencies in the Customs Department’s offices. That noting the difficulty in the acquisition of the same, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers intervened to try and engage with the Customs Department on behalf of not just the Appellant, but the industry at large, but ultimately this proved futile.






24.
That on 23
rd
 January, 2022, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent indicating that after years of follow-up, they now had some of the Certificates of Export, an audit report from the TREO officer confirming successful exit points, and certified copies of the original export entries by the Customs officer at the exit points as stipulated in the letter dated 26
th
 September, 2022. That accordingly, the Appellant again asked the Respondent to reconsider the Appellant’s application for VAT refunds on this basis.






25.
That the Appellant's letter dated 23
rd
 January, 2022 went un-responded to and the Appellant again through its tax agents wrote to the Respondent on 4
th
 February, 2022.






26.
That the Respondent via an email rejected to review the additional information provided in support of the Appellant’s refund applications dated 26
th
 October, 2011 and 10
th
 May, 2012 amounting to Kshs. 26,781,163.00 on grounds that the Commissioner had made a ruling on 7
th
 April, 2015.






27.
The Appellant stated that noting the same, it objected, through its agents, to the Respondent's decision to reject reviewing the information requested by the Respondent itself. That in making the objection, the Appellant relied on Section 51(7) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 citing the difficulties it had in retrieving the Certificates of Export from the Customs Department.






28.
That the Respondent rejected the Appellant's objection on 29
th
 March, 2022 citing an inordinate delay in raising the objection. That in its objection decision, the Respondent conveniently failed to take cognizance of the several meetings, and particularly its letter dated 26
th
 September, 2017 indicating the Appellant's refund would be considered if the Appellant furnished the Certificates of Export among other documents requested.






29.
That in any event, the Respondent in citing inordinate delay was attempting to craft the very unfair narrative that the Appellant was idling and twiddling its thumbs which was the cause for the delay. That indeed, the Respondent was very much aware of the trials and tribulations the Appellant has been through as it was involved in every step of the way with the promise that the documents would be reviewed and the Appellant's refund claim be considered.






30.
The Appellant submitted that it should be noted that at the time of the Appellant making the refund applications, the provision of the Certificate of Export was not a requirement, yet the Appellant followed the Respondent's directives appreciating the presumption of regularity.






31.
That the Respondent further failed to take cognizance of the fact that the application for late objection was necessitated by the fact that at the behest of the Respondent's demand, the Appellant expended valuable time, effort and resources in the obtaining of Certificates of Export, and unfortunately due to inefficiencies in the Respondent's sister Department, the acquisition of the Certificates took a considerable amount of time. That the acquisition was however necessary as the Respondent had severally intimated that the refund claim would be considered upon acquisition of the Certificates.






32.
That upon receipt of the Respondent's decision dated 29
th
 March, 2022 wherein the Respondent rejected the Appellant's application to file a late objection for the VAT refund, the Appellant instituted Appeal No. 500 of 2022 before this Tribunal, and the same was litigated to conclusion in the Appellant's favor.






33.
That this Tribunal in the aforementioned Judgment crucially noted that the Respondent's demand for the Certificates was unjustified and illegal. That in verbatim, this Tribunal averred that;
“
In the same way, the Respondent's action in compelling the Appellant to provide COEs in regards to a refund claim of 26
th
 October 2011 and 10
th
 May 2012 when the Guidelines which made COEs mandatory documents in processing refund claims came into effect on 12
th
 April 2013 was unlawful and unjustified.”






34.
That accordingly, the matter was effectively laid to bed in favor of the Appellant as this Tribunal further ordered as follows;
a)
The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
b)
The Respondent's decision dated 29
th
 March 2022 rejecting the Appellant's application to lodge its objection out of time be and is hereby set aside.
c)
The Appellant be and is hereby granted leave to lodge its Objection to the VAT refund application within 30 days from the date of delivery of this Judgment.”






35.
That in line with the Tribunal's judgement, the Appellant raised its objection on 6
th
 October 2023 and the Respondent issued its objection decision on 13
th
 October 2023 wherein it stated that the objection application could not be reviewed at the Independent Review of Objection as a rejection of refund claim does not constitute an objectionable decision in line with Section 47(13) of the Tax Procedure Act, 2023. That accordingly, the Respondent informed the Appellant to seek recourse before the Tax Appeal Tribunal.






36.
That the aforementioned provision was introduced by the Finance Act 2022, which provided that Section 47 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 be repealed and replaced with the new Section which provided in Subsection 13 that; “A person aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner under this section may appeal to the Tribunal within thirty days after being notified of the decision.”






37.
That the Finance Act 2023 amended Section 2 of the Tax Procedure Act by deleting refund decision as a tax decision. That this meant that refund decisions which were previously objectionable decisions as per Section 51 were no longer objectionable. That consequently, as of 1
st
 July, 2023, the rejection of a refund was no longer an objectionable decision but rather an appealable decision as provided by the dictates of Section 47(13) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






38.
That thus, while the Appellant duly filed the objection within the prescribed 30-day period, adhering to the Tribunal's directives as per the Tribunal’s decision in TAT Appeal No. 500 of 2022, the Respondent is unable to address the same in light of legislative changes introduced by the 2023 Finance Act, which amended the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to exclude refund decisions from the definition of tax decisions subject to the objection process.






39.
The Appellant stated that it is thus requesting this Tribunal to conclusively determine and render a verdict on the Appellant's VAT refund claim dated 26
th
 October 2011 and the 10
th
 May 2012. That it should be appreciated that the only objection the Respondent had to the claim was the provision of the Certificates of Export, and this Tribunal has since ruled that the production of certificates is not a requirement.






40.
The Appellant submitted in conclusion that it has not to date received its refund claims despite having lodged the same in 2011. That indeed, the Appellant was sent on a wild goose chase to search for Certificates of Export which were demanded as a result of retrospective application of Guidelines introduced after filing of the refund claim. That luckily, the Tribunal stepped in and justice was served. That the Appellant is however once again at the doorstep of the Tribunal seeking its indulgence in the determination of the validity of the refund claim conclusively as the Respondent has shifted the burden of doing so to this Tribunal.






41.
The Appellant relied on the following authorities to buttress its case:
i.
TAT Appeal No. 500 of 2022, Narcol Aluminum Rolling Mills vs. Commissioner of Legal services and Board Co-ordination.
ii.
Chief Land Registrar & 4Others vs. Nathan Tirop Koech & 4 Others [2018] eKLR on legitimate expectation.
iii.
Sifa International Limited vs. NSSF Board of Trustees [2010] eKLR on the maxim omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta (All things are presumed to have been done correctly)
iv.
Kibos Distillers Limited & 4 Others vs. Benson Ambuti Adega & 3 Others [2020] eKLR on the presumption of regularity.
v.
Intersplav vs. Ukraine on the expectation that VAT refunds compensation when criteria an requirements have been met by a taxpayer.








Appellant’s Prayers


42.
The Appellant prayed that:
i.
That this Appeal be allowed.
ii.
That this Honorable Tribunal issues a decision on the validity of the Appellant’s VAT refund claims dated 26
th
 of October 2011 and the 10
th
 of May 2012.
iii.
That the Appellant's VAT refund claim be allowed in its entirety.








Respondent’s Case


43.
The Respondent’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated 13
th
 October, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 December, 2023.






44.
The Respondent stated that it refutes each and every one of the allegations by the Appellant in the Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts and averred that in the absence of alleged exports in the Simba system, the claim for refunds cannot be entertained.






45.
That the Respondent is reliant on Section 17(5) of VAT Act 2013, among other enabling provisions of the law to support its case.








Respondent’s Prayers


46.
The Respondent prayed for orders that:
i.
The Appeal be dismissed with costs.
ii.
The decision vide letter dated 13
th
 October, 2023 be upheld.








Issue For Determination


47.
The Tribunal has considered the pleadings and submissions filed by the parties and is of the view that the single issue falling for its determination is:-
Whether the Respondent was justified in rejecting the Appellant’s objection








Analysis And Findings


48.
The Tribunal having established the issue falling for its determination, proceeds to analyse it as hereunder.






49.
This dispute arose from the Respondent’s indication of its inability to comply with the Tribunal’s previous Judgment that the Appellant should lodge an objection to the Respondent’s rejection of its refund claims. The Respondent stated that refund decisions are no longer subject to objections with effect from 1
st
 July, 2023 in line with the 2023 Finance Act which amended Section 2 of the Tax Procedure Act and excluded a refund decision from the definition of a tax decision subject to the objection process.






50.
The Appellant on its part stated that the issue of its VAT refund claim had been addressed in TAT Appeal No. 500 of 2022, Narcol Aluminum Rolling Mills Limited v Commissioner Legal Services and Board Coordination wherein the dispute at hand was the Respondent’s rejection of the Appellant’s refund claims as the Respondent was erroneously demanding Certificates of Export to process the Appellant’s claims. That the Tribunal ultimately determined the case in favor of the Appellant and ordered that the Appellant lodge an objection against the Respondent's decision dated 7
th
 April, 2015.






51.
The Appellant argued that while it lodged the objection within 30 days as per the Tribunal's directives, the Respondent in its decision dated 13
th
 October, 2023 indicated its inability to comply with the Tribunal’s Judgment.






52.
The Tribunal notes that the Finance Act 2023 amended Section 3 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 by stating as follows:
“
49. Section 3 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015, is amended in the definition of “tax decision”—
(a)
by deleting item (e);…”






53.
The Tribunal further notes that the aforementioned, deleted “item (e)” refers to a refund decision. This amendment was effective 1
st
 July, 2023.






54.
Section 51 of the TPA provides as follows:
1.
A taxpayer who wishes to dispute a tax decision shall first lodge an objection against that tax decision under this section before proceeding under any other written law.
2.
A taxpayer who disputes a tax decision may lodge a notice of objection to the decision, in writing, with the Commissioner within thirty days of being notified of the decision.”






55.
The import of the change in law that refund decisions were no longer considered to be tax decisions as read together with Section 51 of the TPA means that taxpayers did not have recourse in objections under Section 51 as far as refund decisions are concerned.






56.
Further, appealable decision is defined under the TPA as follows:
“
appealable decision” means an objection decision and any other decision made under a tax law other than—
(b)
a tax decision; or
(c)
a decision made in the course of making a tax decision;”






57.
The Tribunal posits that with refund decisions no longer being subject to objection as per Finance Act 2023, it follows therefore that based on the changes effected on the same in the Finance Act 2023, they would then fall to be appealable decisions as per the definition of the same under the TPA.






58.
The Tribunal however notes, that while the Finance Act 2023 made the aforementioned changes, in a decision delivered on 31
st
 July, 2024; Civil Appeal No. E003 of 2023 - National Assembly & another v Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & 55 others (Consolidated with Civil Appeal Nos. E016, E021, E049 AND E064, E080 OF 2024), the Kenyan Court of Appeal (the Court) declared the Finance Act 2023 (the Act) unconstitutional.






59.
The import of the Court of Appeal decision is that any changes to the tax statutes effected by the Finance Act 2023 were effectively rendered nugatory. It follows therefore that the deletion of refund decisions from the ambit of tax decisions was effectively negated and the statute reverted to its previous text and therefore, in the current scenario, the Appellant was justified in objecting to the Respondent’s rejection of its refund application as was previously directed by this Tribunal.






60.
In light of the Court of Appeal decision, the Respondent ought to issue an objection decision to the Appellant’s notice of objection as refund decisions are now subject to the objection process.








Final Decision


61.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited. Consequently, the Tribunal makes the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
b.
The Respondent be and is hereby directed to issue an objection decision in response to the Appellant’s notice of objection dated 6
th
 October, 2023 within Thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of this Judgment.
c.
Each Party to bear its own costs.






62.
It is so ordered.

Kenya Ports Authority


 


Appellant




and




Commissioner Of Domestic Taxes


 


Respondent










Judgment










Background


1.
The Appellant is a body corporate established under Section 3 of the Kenya Ports Authority Act Cap. 391 of laws of Kenya discharging such functions as are bestowed on it under the statute.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under and in accordance with Section 13 of the Kenya Revenue Authority Act, and the Kenya Revenue Authority is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.






3.
The Respondent conducted assessments relating to withholding tax for the years 2020 to 2022.






4.
The Appellant objected to the assessments on 22
nd
 June, 2023.






5.
The Respondent issued an objection decision on 10
th
 July, 2023.






6.
The Appellant being dissatisfied with the objection decision, filed the instant Appeal on 8
th
 August, 2023.








The Appeal


7.
The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 21
st
 August, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 August, 2023:
a.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in determining that income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd (JPCL) for the years 2020-2022 amounting to Kshs.78,533,571.00 (Inclusive pf penalty and intertest) on contractual consulting services (Detailed Design, Construction Supervision) was subject to withholding tax on income of a non-resident accrued and derived in Kenya.
b.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact by not factoring the Exchange of Notes, referenced MOF/ERD/11/79/38/01 dated 16
th
 January, 2015, which is an International Treaty between the Government of Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of the Republic of Kenya specifically for the Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP) Phase I &Il Loan KE-P30. The said Treaty between the two sovereigns exempted Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Contractor, Companies, Suppliers, Consultants, and employees of the Japanese companies from all fiscal levies, taxes and duties payable on income derived within Kenya during the implementation of the MPDP Phase II Project.
c.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact by computing withholding tax assessments for JPCL to the Appellant where it was not practically able to deduct said tax. The Respondent did not make any payments to JPCL for services provided. It's role was to provide completion certificates and the payments were made by JICA and not the Respondents.
d.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in averring that the suit Exchange of Notes, referenced MOF/ERD/11/79/38/01 dated 16
th
 January, 2015, which is an International Treaty between the Government of Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of the Republic of Kenya specifically for the Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP) Phase l &Il Loan KE-P30, was superseded by a letter from the Principal Secretary (PS) National Treasury and Planning under reference number DFN 15/232/011 dated 10
th
 August, 2018 addressed to the Commissioner and copied to the Appellant, thus rendering the said Exchange of Notes nugatory. The Appellant reiterates that the withholding tax assessments in this suit arose out of the said International Treaty between the two sovereigns which exempted Japanese companies, consultants and employees from domestic taxes and levies.
e.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in rendering worthless the Exchange of Notes referenced MOF/ERD/11/79/38/01 and dated 16
th
 January, 2015, an International Treaty producing obligatory legal effects between the two Governments, because a letter from the Principal Secretary (PS) National Treasury and Planning dated 10
th
 August, 2018, advising that withholding tax on income is payable for the project, originated from the same office.
f.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in rendering the Exchange of Notes referenced MOF/ERD/11/79/38/01 and dated 16
th
 January, 2015, an International instrument with express consents to be bound a treaty, as inconsequential because the letter from the Principal Secretary (PS) National Treasury and Planning dated 10
th
 August, 2018, advising that withholding tax on income is payable for the Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP) Phase II project, was the most recent.
g.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in determining that the Withholding tax assessments for the years 2020-2022 amounting to Kshs. 78,533,571.00 (Inclusive of Penalty and Interest) on Contractual Consulting Services (Detailed Design, Construction Supervision) to Japan Port Consultants Ltd financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) falls under the purview of Section 3 and 35(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 470) and not the exemption provisions stipulated in the Exchange of Notes referenced MOF/ERD/11/79/38/01 and dated 16
th
 January, 2015.
h.
The Respondent erred in law and in fact in determining that the Appellant ought to have deducted and remitted to the Respondent the income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd (JPCL) for the years 2020-2022 amounting to Kshs. 78,533,571.00 (Inclusive pf penalty and intertest) on contractual consulting services (Detailed Design, Construction Supervision). Further, the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning directed that the income which accrued in or was derived from Kenya by Japanese companies, Japanese consultants and Japanese employees involved in projects including MPDP Phase II project, shall be exempt from income tax to the extent specified in the Exchange of Notes vide Legal Notice No.15 of 26
th
 February, 2021.








Appellant’s Case


8.
The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents:
a.
The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 21
st
 August, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 August, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.
b.
The Affidavit of Herbert Kachila filed to support the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal sworn on the 21
st
 August, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 August, 2023.
c.
The Appellant’s witness statement of Herbert Kachila dated 6
th
 March, 2024 and filed on 7
th
 March, 2024 that was admitted in evidence under oath on 15
th
 May, 2024.
d.
The Appellant’s written submissions dated 28
th
 May, 2024 and filed on 29
th
 May, 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.






9.
That the Mombasa Port Development Project's (MPDP) was conceived from a loan agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the Republic of Kenya signed in December of 2007 for the implementation of Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP). The Project was to be implemented in two phases i.e Phase I and Phase Il.






10.
That the MPDP Phase I project was implemented with terms and conditions agreed as set out in an Exchange of Notes that was signed between the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Republic of Kenya, and the then Minister of Finance of the Republic of Kenya, on 20
th
 November, 2007 as the representatives of the two Governments.






11.
That an Exchange of Notes was signed on 20
th
 November 2007 and the International Treaty indicated that the loan advanced to the Government of the Republic of Kenya amounted to JPY 26,711,000,000.00 (Twenty-Six Billion Seven Hundred and Eleven Million Japanese Yen) was to be advanced by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.






12.
That the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Contractor, Companies, Suppliers, Consultants and employees of the Japanese companies were exempted from all fiscal levies, taxes and duties payable on income derived within Kenya during the implementation of the MPDP Phase I and II projects by the Ministry of Finance, as per the provisions of the Exchange of Notes dated 20
th
 November, 2007.






13.
That after the completion of MPDP Phase I project, a second Exchange of Notes was signed between the Government of the Republic of Kenya through the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning and the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Republic of Kenya on 16
th
 January, 2015 and the International Treaty provided terms and conditions for the implementation of the Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP) Phase ll.






14.
That Clause 8 of the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 provided as follows:
“


8.
(1)
The Government of the Republic of Kenya shall exempt:
a)
...
b)
Japanese companies operating as suppliers, contractors and/or consultants from all fiscal levies and taxed imposed in the Republic of Kenya with respect to the income accruing from the supply of products and/or services to be provided under the Loan.”








15.
That the Government of Japan proceeded to gazette the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 in Japan as is the procedure after signing of International Treaties between the Government of Japan and other countries.






16.
That the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 exempted the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Contractor, Companies, Suppliers, Consultants and employees of the Japanese companies from all fiscal levies, taxes and duties payable on income derived within Kenya during the implementation of the MPDP Phase ll project.






17.
That the terms and conditions provided for in the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 for the implementation of MPDP Phase II project mirrored the terms and conditions previously agreed upon in the Exchange of Notes dated 20
th
 November, 2007 including but not limited to the exemptions from all fiscal levies, taxes and duties because they were part of the same project.






18.
That similar to the MPDP Phase I project, and after the commencement of the MPDP II contract, the Appellant sought a tax exemption from the Respondent based on the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015, which was declined with the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes then demanding withholding tax on income from the Appellant amounting to Kshs. 78,533,571.00 (Inclusive of Penalty and Interest) on Contractual Consulting Services (Detailed Design, Construction Supervision) to Japan Port Consultants Ltd.






19.
The Appellant further pleaded that with a guarantee from the Government of the Republic of Kenya received a Loan (Loan Agreement- P30 dated 9
th
 March, 2015) from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under STEP loan package towards the cost of MPDP II.






20.
That the Appellant submitted to the Tribunal a communication by the Appellant's Tender Committee confirming that the subject project was awarded to Consortium of Japan Port Consultants Ltd (JPC) and BAC/GKA JV Company Ltd. That the said exhibits confirmed that concurrence had been received from JICA for the award of contract to JPC.






21.
That subsequently a contract dated 29
th
 April, 2016 was signed between the Appellant and the Consultants. That the Consultant was a non-resident contractor and concurrence had to be obtained from JICA before the contract could be signed.






22.
That the Consultants' Contract was anchored upon the Loan Agreement dated 9
th
 March, 2015 between the Appellant and JICA as evidenced by Recital (c) of the Contract where JICA had agreed to make a loan to the Borrower for the purpose of financing Mombasa Port Development Phase II.






23.
The Appellant emphasised that the terms and conditions provided for in the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 for the implementation of the MPDP Phase II project mirrored the terms and conditions previously agreed upon in the Exchange of Notes dated 20
th
 November, 2007 including but not limited to the exemptions from all fiscal levies, taxes and duties because they were part of the same Project.






24.
The Appellant made reference to the exemptions issued on MPDP1 and in particular in the letter dated 29
th
 August, 2011 in which the Permanent Secretary Treasury wrote to the Respondent noting as follows:
“
We studied the agreement signed by the Minister for Finance and provides that the government of the Republic of Kenya shall exempt:
Japanese Companies operating as suppliers, contractors and/or consultants from all fiscal levies and taxes imposed in the Republic of Kenya with respect to the income accruing from the supply of products and/or services to be provided under the Loan.
Accordingly, the withholding tax exemption that is being requested is covered.”






25.
That it is very clear that the import of Clause 8 of the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015 is that the withholding tax was also exempted in MPDP II and the Appellant relied on such understanding in executing the contract with the consultants.






26.
That subsequently, the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning issued Legal Gazette Notice No. 15 of 26
th
 February, 2021 exempting the income accrued in the Finance Agreements listed in the Schedule thereunder from income tax.






27.
It was the Appellant's case that as per the wording of the said Gazette notice, the income tax was exempted from the date of the Finance Agreement and not just from the date of the Gazette Notice.






28.
That the operating words used in the Legal Notice No. 15 i.e. “income which was derived in or was derived” means that, at the date of the Legal Notice the income had already been derived to the extent provided for in the Finance Agreement listed thereunder. That for clarity, the third column of the Schedule provided for the respective dates of the Finance Agreements.






29.
That accordingly, the income derived from Kenya under Loan Agreement – P30 dated 9
th
 March, 2015 by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was exempted from income tax and as such no withholding tax assessment against the Appellant can arise.






30.
That subsequently, the subject Legal Notice No. 15 of 26
th
 February 2021 was the subject of litigation in High Court Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi vs Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Commissioner General KRA & Others and the coming into effect of declarations of the High Court were then suspended by the Court of Appeal in National Assembly, Republic of Kenya & Anor v Matindi & 3 Others (2023) KECA 1566 (KLR) (Court of Appeal Decision).






31.
That the effect of the judgment of the High Court (which has now been suspended by the Court of Appeal) was that the Income tax that is collectible under the financing agreements which were covered by the impugned Gazette Notice, are taxes that accrued after the date of Judgment which was on 17
th
 February, 2023.






32.
The Appellant pleaded that the withholding tax assessment which is the subject of this Appeal was in respect to income which had long been derived in the periods between 2020 and 2022; way before the Gazette Notice was quashed and as such not collectable. That the Projects had long been concluded before the Gazette Notice was declared unconstitutional.






33.
That similar to the MPDP Phase I project, after the commencement of the MPDP II contract, the Appellant sought a tax exemption from the Respondent based on the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015, which was declined. That in return, the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes then demanded withholding tax on income from the Appellant amounting to Kshs.78,533,571.00- (inclusive of Penalty and Interest) on Contractual Consulting Services (Detailed Design, Construction Supervision) to Japan Port Consultants Ltd.






34.
That the Appellant objected to the decision of the Respondent stating that Japan Port Consultants Ltd as consultants and construction supervisors for MPDP Phase Il project were exempt from the withholding taxes on income, as stated in the Exchange of Notes dated 16
th
 January, 2015.






35.
That on 10
th
 July, 2023, the Respondent gave an objection decision to the Appellant's objection, demanding that the Appellant pay withholding tax on income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd amounting to Kshs. 78,533,571.00 (inclusive of Penalty and Interest) to avert enforcement of the same.






36.
That the Appellant did not receive any of the loan disbursement to be paid to the Consultants, Japan Port Consultants Ltd, in the implementation of the MPDP Phase II project. That it only received invoices for works rendered by the Consultants, approved the invoice against the works done and forwarded the approved invoice to JICA to remit the payments to the Consultants directly.






37.
That the Appellant did not process any payments to the Consultants, Japan Port Consultants Ltd, therefore could not deduct and remit to the Respondent any taxes on payments in the implementation of MPDP Phase II contract, as alleged by the Respondent.






38.
It was the Appellant's contention that, in rendering, the Exchange of Notes dated 16th January 2015 as nugatory, the Respondent breached Articles 7, 18, 26, 27 and 60 of the United Nations Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969).






39.
The Appellant stated that the main issue for determination is whether withholding income tax is due and payable as assessed by the Respondent. That in submitting on this issue the Appellant consolidated the grounds of appeal into 3 main grounds:
a.
Whether the Appellant could withhold tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner
b.
What is the current legal effect of Legal Notice No. 15 of 26
th
 February 2021?
c.
Whether the holding in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021 Kenya Ports Authority vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes is applicable in this appeal








i.          Whether the Appellant could withhold tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner


40.
That noting that the Appellant was not making any payments, it was thus not the proper person to deduct the withholding income tax as the same ought to be withheld at the point of making actual payment by the person making payment as per Section 35 of the Income Tax Act. That in this case the withholding would then have to be done by JICA and not the Appellant.






41.
That Section 35 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act provides that:
“


35.
Deduction of tax from certain income:
(1)
Every person shall, upon payment of any amount to any non-resident person not having a permanent establishment in Kenya in respect of-
(a)
a management or professional fee or training fee except-
(i)
a commission paid to a non-resident agent in respect of flowers, fruits or vegetables exported from Kenya and auctioned in any market outside Kenya and audit fees for analysis of maximum residue limits paid to a non-resident laboratory or auditor; or
SUBPARA(ii)
a commission paid by a resident air transport operator to a non-resident agent in order to secure tickets for international travel;
(b)...
which is chargeable to tax, deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate;”








42.
That the import of Section 35(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act contemplates that the chargeable tax shall be deducted at the time payment of any amount is being made to any non-resident. That in this case the Appellant made no payment and the same was made by JICA.






43.
The Appellant relied on the decision of this Tribunal in Tax Appeal No. 123 of 2022 Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) vs Commissioner of Legal Services & Board Coordination where it alleged that the facts of that appeal were similar to this case to the extent that the Appellant was not making any direct payment to the non-resident contractor and the same was done by the non-resident development partner.






44.
That the Tribunal in the Kenya National Highways Authority case (supra) correctly held as follows:
“
The Respondent's argument that the Appellant ought to have “advised"" the contractor and/or the development partner to withhold from the partner borders on an absurdity as the failure by the Appellant to “advise” a development partner who has not been established as an agent to withhold income paid to a non-resident contractor is not enough reason for the Respondent to demand the same from the Appellant. No part of the law or the Circular from the National Treasury on the Guidelines for Withholding Income Tax on Officially Aid Funded Projects or the Income Tax Act provides that the Appellant ought to have “advised” a foreign non-resident development partner to withhold income tax on money paid to a non-resident contractor or implementor of the OAFP.”






45.
That accordingly, the Appellant submitted that it was impossible for the Appellant to advise JICA who is a non-resident development partner to withhold income tax for the income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd (non-resident contractor). That the Appellant itself had no opportunity to withhold the tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner.






46.
The Appellant urged the Tribunal to follow its own decision as held in Kenya National Highways Authority case (supra) where at paragraph 54 it held that:
“
To this end, the Tribunal agrees with the Appellant in the sense that there was no way for the Appellant to withhold the tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner. The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Respondent erred in charging Withholding income tax on the Appellant”.






47.
The Appellant submitted that the Respondent's argument that the Appellant should have advised JICA to withhold income tax would have resulted into an absurdity as held in the case of Palm Oil Research and Development Board of Malaysia & Another vs. Premium Vegetable Oils SDN BHD [2004]2 CLJ 265 which was relied upon in Primarosa Flowers Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax [2017] eKLR where it was held that:
“
The correct approach to be adopted by a court when interpreting a taxing statute is that set out in the advice of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Donovan in Mangin v Inland Revenue Commissioner [1971]AC 739:
First, the words are to be given their ordinary meaning. They are not to be given some other meaning simply because their object is to frustrate legitimate tax avoidance devices...moral precepts are not applicable to the interpretation of revenue statutes. Secondly,...one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption so to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used...Thirdly, the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the legislature, it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If therefore a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an interpretation may be adopted. Fourthly, the history of an enactment and the reasons which led to its being passed may be used as an aid in its construction...Hence, the governing principle is this. When construing a taxing or other statute, the sole function of the court is to discover the true intention of Parliament .In that process, the court is under a duty to adopt an approach that produces neither injustice nor absurdity; in other words, an approach that promotes the purpose or object underlying the particular statute albeit that such purpose or object is not expressly set out therein.”






48.
The Appellant submitted that, accordingly, there was no opportunity for it to withhold the income tax as all the payments were made by the non-resident development partner and not the Appellant






49.
The Appellant further submitted that Section 13(1) of the Income Tax Act provides as follows:
“
(1)
Notwithstanding anything in Part II, the income specified in Part I of the First Schedule which accrued in or was derived from Kenya shall be exempt from tax to the extent so specified.”






50.
That the First Schedule, Clause II of the Income Tax Act then provides as follows:
“
The income of any person from any management or professional fee, royalty or interest when the Minister certifies that it required to be paid free of tax by the terms of an agreement to which the Government is a party either as principal or guarantor and that it is in the public interest that such income shall be exempted from tax.”






51.
That it is an undisputed fact that pursuant to the Exchange of Notes which was executed by the Cabinet Secretary of the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya, the income that is the subject of this Appeal was exempted from income tax and thus withholding tax was not applicable.






52.
That it is also an undisputed fact that the loan was guaranteed by the Government of Kenya. That thus, pursuant to Section 13 (1) as read with the First Schedule Clause 11 of the Income Tax Act, noting that the Cabinet Secretary had executed the Exchange of Notes certifying that the income is free from any tax, the Respondent has no legal standing under the said provisions of the law to claim for withholding tax. That nonetheless, the Appellant reiterated that it was not possible for the Appellant to withhold any income tax as it was not making any payments to the consultants.






53.
The Appellant submitted that Section 13(1) is still in operation as only Section 13 (2) of the Income Tax Act was declared unconstitutional.








ii.        What is the current legal effect of Legal Notice No. 15 of 26
th
 February 2021?


54.
That under paragraph 2 of the objection decision dated 10
th
 July, 2023, the Respondent provided the basis of the assessment as follows:
“
The Commissioner charged withholding tax on income earned by Japan Port Consultants Limited (JPCL) on Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP)- Phase 2 for the years of income 2020 to 2022 under section 3 of Income Tax Act (ITA) Cap 470. This was necessitated by the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) Judgement in Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi Vs Cabinet secretary- National Treasury, Commissioner General- Kenya Revenue Authority, Attorney General, National Assembly and Speaker of National Assembly.”






55.
That Section 13 (2) of the Income Tax Act empowers the Cabinet Secretary to issue tax exemptions from income which accrued in or was derived from Kenya by notice in the Gazette.






56.
The Appellant submitted that it is an undisputed fact that the Cabinet Secretary issued Gazette Notice No. 15 of 2021 which read as follows:
“
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 13 (2) of the Income Act, the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning directs that the income which accrued in or was derived from Kenya by Japanese companies, Japanese Consultants and Japanese employees involved in the Projects under the Finance Agreements specified in the second column of the Schedule that were signed on the corresponding dates specified in the second column of the schedule shall be exempt from income tax to the extent specified in the Financing Agreements.”






57.
That the language of the Legal Notice was that the income which accrued pursuant to the respective Finance Agreements had been exempted to the extent specified in the Financing Agreement. That as such the exemption granted was as per the specifications outlined in the Finance Agreements and the respective dates of the Financing Agreement.






58.
The Appellant thus disagreed with the Respondent's contention that the exemption under Legal Notice 15 was never backdated. That the Legal Notice was clear that the exemption of the income tax was to the extent specified in the Financing Agreements and not just from the date of the Legal Notice.






59.
That the Respondent in its Statement of Facts argued that the withholding tax assessment was issued following the declaration by the High Court that the subject Legal Notice No. 15 was declared unconstitutional. That however, the Appellant argued that the Respondent should look at the entire Judgment holistically and not just part of it.






60.
That the Appellant is in agreement that the subject Legal Notice was the subject of litigation in High Court Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi vs Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Commissioner General KRA & Others.






61.
The Appellant however submitted that that even though the Learned Judge went on to declare the Legal Notice unconstitutional he observed that the exemptions under the Legal Notice were to the extent specified in the financing agreements as stated under paragraph 81 of the Judgment:
“
The Legal Notice No. 15 of 2021 dated 15/2/2021 and published on 26/2/2021 as issue No. 17, states “...the extent specified in those financing agreements”






62.
That additionally, in making the finding whether the income tax exempted under the Legal Notice No. 15 was thus collectable, the High Court made the finding at paragraph 131 of the Judgment as follows:
“
The court declines to compel the Kenya Revenue Authority to do its duty since there is no evidence that they have failed to carry out their duties. This is because, they were not under obligation to collect the income tax before this declaration was made. Their duty starts today.”






63.
That on the same issue, the Learned Judge thus went on to make the following declaration under order (1):
“
Income Tax covered under legal notice dated 15/2/2021 published on26/2/2021 as issue no. 17 is collectable with effect from the date of quashing of the impugned unconstitutional Legal Notice No. 15 of 2021”






64.
That the import of paragraph 81 as read pursuant to the Legal Notice No. 15, the income tax had been exempted to the extent provided in the Finance Agreement. That the income that is collectable is one that accrued from the date of the Judgment which was 17
th
 February, 2023 and not prior.






65.
That the income that is the subject of this Appeal had been earned in the years 2020 to 2022 and not after the date of the Judgment which was 17
th
 February, 2023 and thus no income tax was collectable.






66.
That following that Judgment, the National Assembly appealed the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal and sought for stay of implementation of the High Court declarations.






67.
That the Court of Appeal rendered its Ruling on an application for conservatory orders in National Assembly, Republic of Kenya & Anor v Matindi & 3 others (2023) KECA 1566 (KLR) (Court of Appeal Decision).






68.
That similarly, in light of the Ruling by the Court of Appeal, the argument by the Respondent that the tax exemptions could not be backdated noting that the Legal Notice No. 15 was dated 25
th
 February 2021 seemed to be incorrect.






69.
That at paragraph 33 of the Court of Appeal Judgment the Learned Judges of the appellate court held as follows:
“
Having considered the respective positions of the parties on the nugatory aspect, we take the view that in this case, great hardship and inconvenience would be occasioned to the applicants, against the public interest, should the orders sought not be granted. The 4th respondent would be required to put in place mechanisms for recovery of taxes exempted, over a period in excess of ten years-noting that the exemptions to Japanese companies commenced in August 2010, under bilateral country-country arrangements with the government of Kenya.”






70.
The Appellant posited that the Court of Appeal thus clearly appreciated that the tax exemptions by Legal Notice No. 15 goes back to August 2010 under various financing agreements and not just from the date of the Legal Notice.






71.
That in conclusion, the Court of Appeal suspended the coming into effect of the declarations made by the trial court and held as follows at paragraph 38 of its Ruling:
“
We believe that the circumstances of this case warrant the grant of an order, which we hereby grant, temporarily suspending the coming into effect of the declarations made by the trial court with respect to Legal Notice No. 15 of 2021 and section 13 of the Income Tax Act. The suspension of the said declarations shall remain in force for a period of six (6) months from the date hereof, pending hearing and determination of the applicants' appeal, which counsel for the applicants and the 2nd and 3rd respondents informed the Court had already been filed.”








iii.        Whether the holding in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021; Kenya Ports Authority vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes is applicable in this appeal?


72.
That the Respondent in its response relied on the decision of this Tribunal in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021 Kenya Ports Authority vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes. That on the onset, the Appellant submitted that even though the contract in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021 was financed under the same Finance Agreement of 9
th
 March, 2015; the circumstances that prevailed at the time of filing that Appeal was different from the circumstances in the present Appeal for two major reasons.
a.
In Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021, the withholding tax assessment was issued vide the letter dated 17
th
 December 2020 which was objected to vide the letter dated 8
th
 January 2021. That subsequently, the objection decision was then issued vide the letter dated 26
th
 January, 2021. That the appeal was then filed on 24
th
 February 2021.
b.
That at the time the Respondent was issuing the objection decision on 26
th
 January, 2021 (in TAT No. 105 of 2021), the Legal Notice No. 15 dated 25
th
 February 2021 and published on 26
th
 February 2021 had not been issued. That the Tribunal in that Appeal went on to observe that as much at paragraph 53 as follows:
“
The impugned assessment was issued by the Respondent on the Appellant on 17
th
 December, 2020 and since the respective income tax exemption was effective from 25
th
 February, 2021, the assessment, in our respectful view remains.”






73.
That additionally, the Tribunal went on to consider the effect of the subject Legal Notice in TAT No. 105 of 2021 at paragraph 52 of its decision and held that the effective date of tax exemption was the date of the Legal Notice being 25
th
 February, 2021.






74.
The Appellant submitted that such holding was erroneous in view of the interpretations now issued in the recent decisions in High Court Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi vs Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Commissioner General KRA & Others and thereafter the Court of Appeal decision in National Assembly, Republic of Kenya & Anor v Matindi & 3 others (2023) KECA 1566 (KLR) (Court of Appeal Decision) as highlighted herein above.






75.
That simply put, in the High Court decision of 17
th
 February, 2023, the Learned Judge was of the view that tax was collectable from the date of the Judgment when declaration was made quashing the subject Legal Notice. That in the Court of Appeal decision of 19
th
 December, 2023, the Learned Judges of the Appellate Court at paragraph 33 of the Ruling held that tax exemptions commenced August 2010 under the bilateral country-country arrangements with the Government of Kenya.






76.
The Appellant submitted that the decision of this Tribunal in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021 that the tax exemption was effective from 25
th
 February, 2021 was incorrect and should not be relied upon in view of the new jurisprudence.






77.
That this Tribunal in a recent decision of 29
th
 June, 2023 in Tax Appeal No. 123 of 2022 Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) vs Commissioner of Legal Services & Board Coordination (supra), correctly held that there was no way the Appellant could withhold the tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner.






78.
That in rendering its Judgment, this Tribunal in TAT No. 105 of 2021, noted that the Appellant had raised a ground that payment was made directly by the non-resident developing partner to non-resident contractor at paragraph 27 and 28 of its decision while analyzing the Appellant's case. That however, in rendering its determination from Paragraphs 40 to 56 of the Judgment, the Tribunal made no finding on that issue. That the Tribunal's decision largely dealt with effect of the Legal Notice No. 15 which issue is now settled by the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal.






79.
The Appellant urged the Tribunal to be guided by its own decision in Tax Appeal No. 123 of 2022 Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) vs Commissioner of Legal Services & Board Coordination (supra) on the issue of payments being made by the development partner to non-resident contractor and that the Appellant has no way of withholding such income tax.








Appellant’s Prayers


80.
The Appellant prayed that this Tribunal:
a.
Review and set aside the objection decision by the Respondent dated 10
th
 July, 2023.
b.
Declare that the Appellant ought not to remit any withholding tax on income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd amounting to Kshs. 78,533,571.00.
c.
Be pleased to issue any other orders that it may deem fit.








Respondent’s Case


81.
The Respondent’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated 21
st
 September, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 September, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.






82.
That the Respondent charged Withholding tax on income earned by Japan Port Consultants Limited (JPCL) on Mombasa Port Development Project (MPDP) - Phase 2 for the years of income 2020 to 2022 under Section 3 of Income Tax Act CAP 470 of the laws of Kenya.






83.
That the withholding tax due was Kshs. 25,582,365.00 for the year 2020, Kshs. 20, 536,243.00 for year 2021 and Kshs. 32,414,864.00 for year 2022.






84.
That this was necessitated by the outcome in the Judgment in High Court Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi -vs-Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Commissioner General KRA and Others.






85.
The Respondent contended that Legal Notice No. 15 which the Appellant relied upon, came into effect on 25
th
 February, 2021 and therefore does not apply to periods prior to the Notice. That the Legal Notice can therefore not apply retrospectively.






86.
The Respondent further submitted that there was no evidence supplied by the Appellant that the exemption under Legal Notice 15 was ever backdated.






87.
The Respondent reiterated this position on the basis of the finding of the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Tax Appeal No. 105 of 2021 Kenya Ports Authority versus Commissioner of Domestic Taxes, where, while dismissing the Appellant's Appeal, the Tribunal affirmed the objection decision and found that there was no evidence that the effective date of the exemption relied upon by the Appellant was backdated.






88.
The Respondent relied on the finding of the High Court in High Court Petition No. E280 of 2021 Eliud Karanja Matindi -vs- Cabinet Secretary National Treasury, Commissioner General, KRA and Others, where the Court found Legal Notice No. 15 to be unconstitutional and that the same did not undergo public participation as is required by the Constitution.






89.
The Respondent contended that based on the above, it follows that the Income earned by JCL on the Mombasa Port Development Project - Phase 2 for the years of income 2020 to 2022 is chargeable to tax as per the provisions of Section 3 of the Income Tax Act.






90.
That Section 3 of the Income Tax Act brings to charge all income of a person whether resident or non-resident, which accrues or is derived from Kenya. That Sections 10 and 35 of the Act provide for charging of Withholding tax on such income.






91.
That in response to the Appellant's contention that it did not make any payments directly to the contractors and hence could not withhold any taxes, the Respondent contended that the payments were made on account of the Appellant and for the Appellant's benefit.






92.
The Respondent further stated that the monies expended on behalf of the Appellant were in fact in form of a loan which would become payable by the Appellant under the relevant contractual agreements. That it is the Respondent's position that the Appellant owes and should therefore pay the Withholding tax not withheld since the Appellant can recover the same during repayment of the loans.








Respondent’s Prayers


93.
The Respondent prayed for orders that in light of the foregoing, the Appeal herein be dismissed for lack of merit with costs to the Respondent.








Issues For Determination


94.
The Tribunal has considered the pleadings, submissions and witness statement filed by the parties and is of the view that the single issue falling for its determination is:-
Whether the Respondent’s assessment was justified








Analysis And Findings


95.
The Tribunal having established the issue falling for its determination, proceeds to analyse it as hereunder.






96.
This dispute arose from the Respondent’s action of determining that income earned by Japan Port Consultants Ltd (JPCL) for the years 2020-2022 amounting to Kshs.78,533,571.00 on contractual consulting services was subject to withholding tax on income of a non-resident accrued and derived in Kenya. In this regard, the Respondent demanded this tax from the Appellant stating that it was due from the Appellant as payments were made on behalf of the Appellant.






97.
The Appellant on its part argued that the withholding tax was not due as it did not make any payment and that the income that is the subject of this Appeal was exempted from income tax and thus withholding tax was not applicable. That further, a Gazette Notice was issued to this effect.






98.
That further, as a result of the tax exemptions that had been granted being valid up to the date of the said Judgment, the income that is the subject of the instant Appeal was exempted from income tax up to 17
th
 February, 2023 and thus withholding tax was not applicable.






99.
The Tribunal gleaned through Legal Notice No. 15 of 2021 and notes that it provided as follows:
“
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 13 (2) of the Income Act, the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning directs that the income which accrued in or was derived from Kenya by Japanese companies, Japanese Consultants and Japanese employees involved in the Projects under the Finance Agreements specified in the second column of the Schedule that were signed on the corresponding dates specified in the second column of the schedule shall be exempt from income tax to the extent specified in the Financing Agreements.”






100.
Further, the Tribunal has established that in a Judgment delivered by the High Court on 17
th
 February 2023 in Constitutional Petition No. E280 of 2021, the High Court in Mombasa declared that Section 13(2) of the Income Tax Act, Chapter 470 of the Laws of Kenya (Income Tax Act) is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes income tax waivers through a notice in the Gazette and for specified persons without regard to the provisions of Article 210 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010.






101.
The above Judgment found, inter alia, that:
“
Section 13(2) of the Income Tax Act is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes income tax waivers through a notice in the Gazette and for specified persons as opposed to by way of legislation without regard to the provisions of Article 210 of the Constitution.
b.
An exemption or waiver of income tax can only be granted by the National Assembly through national legislation after it passes as a money bill as provided under Article 114(3) of the Constitution after public participation and in strict compliance with Article 210 of the Constitution, which legislation will require that there be:
i.
a public record of each waiver and the reason for the waiver;
ii.
each waiver and the reason for it shall be reported to the Auditor General; and
iii.
in compliance with Article 27 of the Constitution, there should be no waiver based on national origin, race, colour, marital status, health status, ethnic society, religion, conscience, belief, culture, dress, language or birth.
c.
Legislation on tax waiver involving country-by-country agreements must comply with the Constitution and must be on the basis of reciprocity, non-discrimination, equity and tax neutrality;
d.
the National Assembly has no power to authorize waivers of tax other than through legislation as contemplated under Article 210 of the Constitution; and
e.
the National Assembly breached the Constitution by waiving public participation.”






101.
The import of the above ruling of the Court is that to the Japanese companies who are involved in the projects financed under the financing agreements in Legal Notice No. 15 of 2021, the tax exemptions ceased.






102.
Additionally, the Tribunal relies on the decision in Otieno & another v Council of Legal Education (Civil Appeal 38 of 2018) [2021] KECA 349 (KLR) (17 December 2021) (Judgment) where the Court found as follows:
“
However, if a court has declared a piece of legislation or a section of an Act to be unconstitutional, that Act or law became a nullity from the date of inception or enactment and not from the date of the judgment. But it would not apply to actions already crystallized whilst the expunged law was in force.” (emphasis added)






101.
Section 35 (1) (a) of the Income Tax provides that:
“


35.
Deduction of tax from certain income:
(1)
Every person shall, upon payment of any amount to any non-resident person not having a permanent establishment in Kenya in respect of-
(a)
a management or professional fee or training fee except-
(i)
a commission paid to a non-resident agent in respect of flowers, fruits or vegetables exported from Kenya and auctioned in any market outside Kenya and audit fees for analysis of maximum residue limits paid to a non-resident laboratory or auditor; or
(ii)
a commission paid by a resident air transport operator to a non-resident agent in order to secure tickets for international travel;
(b)...
which is chargeable to tax, deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate;”








101.
The import of Section 35 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act contemplates that the chargeable tax shall be deducted at the time payment of any amount is being made to any non-resident.






102.
Further, Rule 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Tax) Rules 2001 provides as follows:
“


4.
(1)
A person who makes a payment of, or on account of, any income which is subject to withholding tax shall deduct tax therefrom in the amount specified –
(a)
under paragraphs 3 and 5 of Head B of the Third Schedule; and
(b)
where the Government of Kenya has double taxation agreement with        the Government of another country, in the terms of that agreement;….”








101.
The aforementioned rule requires that the payer, defined to mean a person who deducts withholding tax for the purposes of these Rules to be the person making payments and withholding the tax. The Appellant in the instant case did not make any payments as the payments were made directly to the non-resident contractor by the non-resident development partner.






102.
The Tribunal posits that the Respondent’s argument that the Appellant ought to have “advised” the contractor and/or the development partner to withhold from the partner borders on an absurdity as the failure by the Appellant to “advise” a development partner who has not been established as an agent to withhold income paid to a non-resident contractor is not enough reason for the Respondent to demand the same from the Appellant. No part of the law provides that the Appellant ought to have “advised” a foreign non-resident development partner to withhold income tax on money paid to a non-resident contractor.






103.
The position of the Tribunal as stated in the foregoing paragraph has been clearly set in the oft-cited case of Cape Brandy Syndicate v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1920] 1 KB 64 where the case of T.M. Bell v Commissioner of Income Tax [1960] EALR 224 was applied in which Rowlatt J. held as follows:-
“
In a taxing Act one has to look at what is clearly said. There is no room for intendment as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used… if a person who ought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed; however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be.”






101.
To this end, the Tribunal agrees with the Appellant in the sense that there was no way for the Appellant to withhold the tax on money paid directly to the non-resident contractor from the non-resident development partner.






102.
The Tribunal reiterates its decision in Tax Appeal No. 123 of 2022 Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) vs Commissioner of Legal Services & Board Coordination (supra) where it pronounced itself on the issue of payments being made by the development partner to non-resident contractor where it found that the Appellant has no way of withholding such income tax.






103.
As a result of the foregoing and the case law from the appellate courts guiding the interpretation of Legal Notice 15 of 2021, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent was not justified in raising the withholding tax assessment on the Appellant.








Final Decision


101.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited. Consequently, the Tribunal proceeds to make the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
b.
The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 10
th
 July, 2023 be and is hereby set aside.
c.
Each Party to bear its own costs.






101.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










Background


1.
The Appellant is a limited liability company duly incorporated in Kenya under the 
Companies Act
. Its main business is in construction.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya. The Kenya Revenue Authority (“KRA”) is an agency of the Government of Kenya for assessing, collecting, and accounting for all revenue.






3.
The Respondent issued the Appellant with additional tax assessments for VAT for the period of December 2017 to May 2018 on 15
th
 November 2019.






4.
The Appellant lodged objections on 17
th
 December 2020 which were rejected by the Respondent on 17
th
 December 2021 confirming the assessments for the reason that the objection was late.






5.
The Appellant filed a Notice of Motion dated 18
th
 April 2023 under a certificate of urgency on 20
th
 April 2023 seeking orders to be granted extension of time to file its appeal out of time. The same application sought the immediate lifting of agency notices placed on it by the Respondent. The Appellant was granted leave to file its appeal out of time and the agency notices were lifted in a Ruling delivered by the Tribunal on 28
th
 July 2023.






6.
Being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s decision and on the basis of the leave granted by the Tribunal, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 14
th
 August 2023.








The Appeal


7.
The Appellant filed its Memorandum of Appeal dated on 10
th
 August 2023 and filed on 14
th
 August 2023 raising the following grounds of appeal:
a.
The Respondent failed, neglected and/or deliberately refused to serve the Appellant with copies of the Agency notices on the banks as required by the law. The Appellant only got to know of the Agency notices from the banks and its clients.
b.
The Respondent failed to note and act accordingly to the effect that the Appellant had the right to access information held by it and that the Appellant required the exercise or protection of its right and fundamental freedom.
c.
The Respondent misdirected itself by failing to render its decision within the prescribed timelines as established under Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 which establishes that where the Commissioner has not made its Objection decision within 60 days from the date the taxpayer lodged a Notice of Objection, the Objection shall be allowed.
d.
The Respondent’s insistence on the Applicant’s Managing Director to provide proof of sickness is an affront to Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya which establishes that every person has the right to privacy which includes the right to have the information relating to private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed.
e.
The Respondent violated Article 47 of 
the Constitution
 and Section 4 of the Fair Administrative Act by failing to act lawfully, and procedurally and failing to give reasons for its actions.
f.
The Respondent knew too well and ought to have known that its administrative action as depicted in the Agency notices was certainly going to adversely affect the rights or fundamental freedoms of the Appellant but failed to:
i.
Give prior and adequate notice of the nature and reasons for the administrative action.
ii.
Give the Appellant an opportunity to be heard and to make representations in that regard.
iii.
Give the Appellant Notice of right to a review or internal appeal against this administrative decision despite being a requirement of law.
iv.
Give the Appellant information, materials and evidence relied upon in making the decision or taking the administrative action
g.
The Respondent’s decision as depicted in the Agency notices was unprocedural and outright abuse of relevant tax laws and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Appellant.








Appellant‘s Case


8.
The Appellant’s case was premised on the following documents:
a.
Its Statement of Facts dated 10
th
 August 2023 and filed on 14
th
 August 2023; and
b.
Its Written Submissions dated 25
th
 March 2024 and filed on 27
th
 March 2024.






9.
The Appellant averred that it had communicated to the Respondent that no formal letter was issued to the taxpayer communicating the issues for which the assessment was raised.






10.
The Appellant stated that it filed late objections to the Respondent’s assessment of VAT for the periods between 1
st
 to 31
st
 December 2017 for Kshs. 8,219,275.68; 1
st
 to 31
st
 January 2018 for Kshs. 1,153,016.57 and Kshs. 790,490.24; 1
st
 to 28
th
 February 2018 for Kshs. 1,033,520.15; 1
st
 to 31
st
 March 2018 for Kshs. 914,942.74; and 1
st
 to 31
st
 May 2018 for Kshs 2,367,900.00 on account of sickness.






11.
The Appellant contended that in a surprise turn of events the Respondent communicated its decision to reject all the Objections on 17
th
 December 2021, one year later written by one Rosemary Sitati who communicated that the reason for the rejections of the late Objections was the failure to avail documentary evidence for filing.






12.
The Appellant averred that whereas the late Objection notices were filed by the Appellant on 17
th
 December 2020 the Respondent communicated its decision on 17
th
 December 2021, one year later and thus failure of the Respondent to render its decision within the prescribed timelines is an illegality.






13.
The Appellant stated that the Respondent subsequently proceeded to issue Agency notices to the Appellant’s banks on a flawed process as the rejection notices were issued one year after the application contrary to Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 with the consequence of the Objection being allowed with no taxes due.






14.
The Appellant contended that its documents had been earlier seized and had not been returned by the Respondent’s officers from the North Rift region and that it had made all attempts and requests for the documents to be returned to no avail.






15.
In its Supplementary Affidavit dated 11
th
 August 2023 and filed on 14
th
 August 2023, the Appellant’s Managing Director introduced a Supplementary list of documents with the Agency notices issued to its bankers.






16.
The Appellant submitted that the late Objection notices were filed on 17
th
 December 2020 but the Respondent communicated its decision on 17
th
 December 2021, one year later, and thus the failure to render the said decision within the prescribed timelines led the Appellant to believe that the Objection had been allowed.






17.
The Appellant argued that the Respondent’s Objection decision was invalid because it was not made and communicated within 60 days of a valid objection and contrary to Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 with the effect of the objection being allowed by operation of the law but the Respondent continued to harass the Appellant with Agency notices while the Objection had been allowed by operation of the law.






18.
The Appellant asserted that Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 is couched on mandatory terms and the Respondent had no jurisdiction to render a decision after 60 days from the date of filing the Objection thus the Respondent had an obligation to respect and enforce the provisions of the law in favour of the Appellant.






19.
The Appellant maintained that the Respondent’s decision violates the Appellant’s Constitutional right to an administrative action that is expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair by purporting to render the decision 12 months later and then later seeking to enforce the said decision through the said Agency Notices.






20.
The Appellant relied on the following cases to support its case:
a.
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes v Fortune Container Depot Tax Appeal No. E060 of 2020
;
b.
Equity Group Holdings Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Civil Appeal No. E069 & E205 of 2020
; and
c.
Krystalline Salt Ltd v KRA [2019] eKLR








Appellant’s prayers.


21.
The Appellant prayed for orders that the Tribunal:
a.
Allows the Appeal herein
b.
Sets aside the Respondent’s Agency notices dated 23
rd
 February 2018
c.
Stops the Respondent from demanding the principal tax, interest, and penalties in respect of the said notices.
d.
Permanently restrains the Respondent from taking any enforcement measures with respect to the demand for tax for the Agency notices dated 23
rd
 February 2023.
e.
Provide costs for the Appeal.
f.
Issue any other remedies that the Honourable Tribunal deems just and reasonable.








Respondent’s Case


22.
The Respondent’s case is premised on the following:
a.
Its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 7
th
 September 2023; and
b.
Its Written Submissions dated 7
th
 March 2024 and filed on 8
th
 March 2024.






23.
The Respondent cited Section 42 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and stated that it issued the Agency notices to the Appellant’s creditors and banks after it noted that the Appellant had not made any attempts to settle its tax debt.






24.
The Respondent contended that the claim made by the Appellant that it was not notified of the Agency notices placed on its creditors and bankers as per Section 42(9) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 are untrue and misleading to this Tribunal as in the notices sent to the Appellant’s creditors and bankers, the Appellant was attached as one of the recipients of the notices hence the communication was adequate.






25.
The Respondent averred that the Appellant effectively received all the communication pertaining to it from the Respondent and thus, it could not claim that its rights under Article 35 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and Section 5 of the 
Access to Information Act
 were infringed upon.






26.
The Respondent stated that it was within its ambit when it issued the invalidation decision to the Appellant at the time that it did as it was not an Objection decision as envisioned under Section 51(11) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






27.
The Respondent cited Section 51(7) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and maintained that it did not violate the Appellant’s rights under Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






28.
The Respondent averred that the onus of proof was upon the Appellant to prove that the delay was not an abuse of the Act. That the late objection was rejected as the Appellant failed to provide documents to prove its claim as per the provisions of Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and Section 30 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
.






29.
The Respondent reiterated that its need to have the Appellant prove that it filed a late objection due to sickness is not a violation of the Appellant’s rights.






30.
The Respondent contended that it is allowed to make additional assessments based on the available information to the best of its judgment pursuant to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and that it was allowed by Section 24(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to assess a taxpayer’s liability using any information available to it.






31.
On whether the Agency notices issued to the Appellant’s banks and creditors by the Respondent were proper in law the Respondent submitted that on 15
th
 November 2019, it issued the Appellant with additional tax assessments with respect to VAT for the periods December 2017, and January, February, March, and May 2018.






32.
It further submitted that the Appellant filed a late Objection on 17
th
 December 2020 for assessment of VAT for the periods in contention and the same was rejected by the Respondent for the reason that the Appellant had failed to provide documentary evidence as proof of the reason for the late Objection.






33.
The Respondent cited Section 42(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and reiterated that on 23
rd
 February 2023, two years after the late Objection rejection, the Respondent noted that the Appellant had not made attempts to settle its tax debts and proceeded to issue agency notices to the Appellant’s creditors and banks pursuant to the law.






34.
The Respondent asserted that the Agency notices served to the Appellant’s bank and creditors were also served to the Appellant concurrently. The Respondent added that, in line with Section 42(9) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, it is standard procedure that Agency notices also contain the taxpayer’s address as one of the recipients thus the Appellant cannot claim that its rights under Article 35 of 
the Constitution
 were infringed upon.






35.
On whether the Respondent erred in its decision that invalidated the Appellant’s late objection the Respondent cited Section 51(7) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and submitted that it was within its ambit when it issued the invalidation decision to the Appellant as the invalidation decision was issued when Section 51(7A) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 was not in force.






36.
The Respondent relied on Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and Section 30 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 and reiterated that the onus of proof was upon the Appellant to prove that the delay was an abuse adding that in this case, the Appellant had failed to avail documents to prove its claim for the reason of the late objection.






37.
The Respondent relied on the case of Kenya Revenue Authority v Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR, and Sections 107 and 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 and maintained that the Appellant had the burden of supporting its reasons for late objection and the current Appeal but had not attempted at either stage to discharge that burden.






38.
The Respondent relied on the case of Ushindi Exporters Limited v Commissioner of Investigation and Enforcement (Tax Appeals Tribunal No 7 of 2015) and asserted that the Appellant failed to support the Appeal with all the relevant documents and it merely made averments that the Respondent was wrong in its decision to invalidate the late objection but failed to support the same with proper documentation.






39.
On whether the Respondent erred by raising additional assessments the Respondent cited Section 24(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and the case of Commissioner of Domestic Taxes v Altech Stream (EA) Limited [2021] eKLR and submitted that it is allowed to make additional assessments based on the available information to the best of its judgment.








Respondent’s prayers


40.
The Respondent prayed for the Tribunal to find that:
a.
The Respondent’s decision to invalidate the late objection was correct and uphold the late objection rejection notices dated 17
th
 December 2021.
b.
The Respondent correctly applied itself in raising additional assessments.
c.
The Appeal herein be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.








Issue for Determination


41.
The Tribunal having evaluated the pleadings and submissions of the parties is of the view that there is a single issue that calls for its determination:
Whether the Respondent was justified in its decision dated 17
th
 December 2021.








Analysis and Findings


42.
The Tribunal having determined the issues falling for its determination proceeds to analyse the same as hereunder.






43.
The Tribunal observes through its Ruling dated 28
th
 July 2023 that it already set aside the agency notices issued against the Appellant and consequently the Tribunal will not delve further into that matter.








Whether the Respondent was justified in its late objection rejection decision dated 17
th
 December 2021.


44.
The Respondent issued the Appellant with additional tax assessments for VAT for the period of December 2017 to May 2018 on 15
th
 November 2019.






45.
The Appellant lodged objections on 17
th
 December 2020 giving sickness as the reason for objecting late. The Appellant submitted that its documents were seized by the Respondent’s officers and that its efforts to recover the documents were futile. It reiterated that it filed a late objection because its director was sick.






46.
The Respondent rejected the late objections on 17
th
 December 2021 confirming the assessments for the reason that the Appellant failed to support its reasons for filing its objections late. The Appellant argued that the Respondent’s expectation that the Appellant would provide the medical information proving the sickness was a violation of its director’s right to privacy under 
the Constitution
.






47.
The Appellant further contended that the Respondent’s decision of 17
th
 December 2021 was time-barred and thus invalid as it was issued one year after the objection was lodged.






48.
The Respondent submitted that the Appellant’s late objection was invalid as the Appellant did not provide any document to support the late objection contrary to Section 51(3)(c) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, and that during the time of the dispute, Section 51(7A) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 was not in place thus it did not have a mandate to inform the Appellant of its objection invalidation within a specified time.






49.
The timelines for objecting to tax assessments are clearly set in the law under Section 51(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 (TPA) which provides as below:
“
(2)
A taxpayer who disputes a tax decision may lodge a notice of objection to the decision, in writing, with the Commissioner within thirty days of being notified of the decision.”






50.
All taxpayers are liable to comply with the timelines, save for when unavoidable circumstances as envisioned in Section 51(7) of the TPA, as cited below, prevent a taxpayer from fulfilling its obligations: -
“
The Commissioner may allow an application for the extension of time to file a notice of objection if—
(a)
the taxpayer was prevented from lodging the notice of objection within the period specified in subsection (2) because of an absence from Kenya, sickness or other reasonable cause; and
(b)
the taxpayer did not unreasonably delay in lodging the notice of objection.”






51.
The Tribunal has perused the evidence presented before it and finds that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof as required under Section 56(1) of the TPA and Section 30 (b) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) Act when it failed to adduce evidence to support its Appeal against the impugned late objection rejection decision and to demonstrate that it did not unreasonably delay in lodging its objection.






52.
The Tribunal notes that indeed Section 51(7A) of the TPA which prescribes the timeline within which the Respondent is to give its decision under Section 51(7) of the TPA on whether to allow extension of time for a taxpayer to file its objection late became operational from 1
st
 July 2022. Therefore, the Appellant having applied for extension of time to file its objection late before the operationalization of this provision, meant that the Respondent was not bound to issue its decision within any specified time. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent suffered no consequence for issuing its decision under Section 51(7) of the TPA on the date it issued the decision.






53.
It is not in dispute that the Appellant filed a late objection and the same did not have accompanying documents to support it per Section 51(7) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






54.
The Appellant’s averment that its director’s sickness was the reason for its lateness and that providing proof of the sickness runs contrary to the director’s Constitutional right to privacy is defeated as the Appellant has the burden of proving whatever it alleges before the Tribunal. The Tribunal cannot accept mere averments of sickness as the gospel truth on account of ‘privacy’. If the Appellant was very strict on its privacy and concerned about having its medical condition seen by the commissioner, then it ought to have relied on another reason for its delay in filing the Objection. The Appellant cannot eat its cake and have it.






55.
The Appellant on its part failed to adduce evidence and merely made averments regarding its reason for filing its objection late. Madan J in his Judgment held in CMC Aviation Ltd V Cruisair Ltd (1) [1978] KLR 103 as thus:-
“
Pleadings contain the averments of the parties concerned. Until they are proved or disproved, or there is an admission of them or any of them, by the parties, they are not evidence and no decision could be founded upon them. Proof is the foundation of evidence. Evidence denotes the means by which an alleged matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted for investigation. Until their truth has been established or otherwise, they remain un-proven. Averments in no way satisfy, for example, the definition of “evidence” as anything that makes clear or obvious; ground for knowledge, indication or testimony; that which makes truth evident, or renders evident to the mind that it is truth.”






56.
The Tribunal also finds that the Appellant’s contention that it made all the attempts to recover the documents that were seized by the Respondent’s officers from the North Rift region is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence of communication from the Appellant to the Respondent requesting the Respondent to return the documents.






57.
Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 further provides on the burden of proof as thus: -
“
In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”






58.
These provisions were reiterated in Section 30 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 which states: -
“
In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving—
(a)
where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; or (b) in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently”






59.
The Tribunal buttresses its observation of the importance of adherence to statutory edicts by referring to the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. The 
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No.247 of 2020
] where it was held at Paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -
“
Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”






60.
It is therefore the Tribunal’s finding that the Respondent was justified in making its decisions dated 17
th
 December 2021.








Final Decision


61.
The upshot to the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal lacks merit and the Tribunal consequently makes the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.
b.
The Respondent’s rejection decision for the late notice of objection dated 17
th
 December 2021 be and is hereby upheld.
c.
Each party to bear its own costs.






62.
It is so ordered.

th
 September 2021.
c.
Grounds of Objection
i.
VAT December 2017: The assessment was erroneous as no income however was generated nor an invoice raised for the said amount. The Commissioner did not provide adequate information as to why the assessment was raised and as such no such incomes were generated to warrant such an assessment.
ii.
VAT February 2018: A close analysis of the VAT filings that were made, it is noted that the VAT for April 2018 made on the 20
th
 May 2018 which was declared as per the withholding certificate that was issued then, even though the invoice was issued in February 2018. Where the assessment was done on the 27th August 2021, the income had been declared earlier as per the Withholding certificate that was issued in the month of April 2018.
iii.
VAT October 2019: The assessment was made based on the disallowing of an invoice detailed below:

The invoice however was a cash sale that was claimed and disallowed based on the fact that the supplier did not declare the same.
iv.
VAT July 2020: The additional assessment did not allow for the output VAT that was made for the supplier.
v.
VAT February 2021: The additional assessment did not allow for the output VAT that was made for the supplier.
vi.
Income tax-2019-2020: The Commissioner disallowed some of the cost of sales as they argue that the same had not been declared in the VAT input while filing the VAT returns. It should be noted that the VAT return template does not accommodate for the cost of sales here then referred to as the purchases that do not have VAT to accommodate in the return. Thus the commissioner is not right in disallowing such cost of sales in the year end return.
vii.
Income Tax-2020-2021: The Commissioner disallowed some of the cost of sales as they argue that the same had not been declared in the VAT input while filing the VAT returns. It should be noted that the VAT return template does not accommodate for the cost of sales here then referred to as the purchases that do not have VAT to accommodate in the return. Thus the Commissioner is not right in disallowing such cost of sales in the year end return.








The Appellant’s Case


13.
The Appellant’s case was premised on its Statement of Facts filed on 23
rd
 June 2023.






14.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred in assessments of VAT for the disputed periods as elucidated in the Memorandum of Appeal which it objected to and the Commissioner confirmed.






15.
The Appellant stated that it gave a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 22
nd
 June 2023.








Appellant’s prayers

17.

th
 October 2023 and filed on 17
th
 October 2023.
b.
Its Written Submissions dated 2
nd

18.
The Respondent cited Sections 31(1)(c), (2) and 51 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and stated the Appellant failed to provide the required documents for the Objection application.






19.
The Respondent relied on Section 56 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and contended that the Appellant failed to provide the required documentation leading to the Respondent issuing the Objection invalidation and the burden of proof is on the Appellant and until the same is discharged to the Commissioner’s satisfaction, this Appeal should be dismissed.






20.
On whether the Appellant herein discharged its burden of proof in challenging the additional assessments the Respondent relied on Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and submitted that it is empowered to make assessments according to the information available which it did.






21.
The Respondent further relied on Section 59 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and submitted that the Appellant failed to provide supporting documents adding that the burden is on the Appellant to demonstrate that it has discharged its tax liability in accordance with Section 56 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






22.
The Respondent cited the following authorities to support its case:-
a.
Section 23 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
;
b.
Section 54 of the 
Income Tax Act
;
c.
The case of Kenya Revenue Authority v Maluki Kitili Mwendwa [2021] eKLR;
d.
Mbuthia Macharia v Annah Mutua Ndigwa 7 Another [2017] eKLR;
e.
Primarosa Flowers Ltd v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [2019] eKLR; and
f.
Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
.






23.
The Respondent asserted that the Appellant was provided with ample time to effectively prosecute its objection application which timelines were within the practical expectations for time under the statutory 60-day objection review cycle.








Respondent’s prayers


24.
The Respondent prayed for the Tribunal to:
a.
Uphold the Respondent’s Objection decision dated 31
st
 May 2021 and the Notice of Invalidation dated 9
th
 May 2022 as proper and in conformity with the provisions of the law;
b.
This Appeal be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.








Issue For Determination


25.
The Tribunal having evaluated the pleadings and submissions of the parties is of the view that there is a single issue that calls for its determination, being:-




SUBDIVISION - Whether there is a proper Appeal before the Tribunal






Analysis And Findings


26.
The Tribunal having identified the issue for its determination proceeds to analyse the same as hereinunder.






27.
The Appellant lodged objections against the Respondent’s assessments on 27
th
 September 2021 and 17
th
 March 2022 which were invalidated by the Respondent on 18
th
 November 2021 and 9
th
 May 2022.






28.
The Respondent issued its objection invalidation decisions on 26
th
 June 2021 and 18
th
 November 2021 and confirmed the assessment with regard to the 9
th
 May 2022 decision on 21
st
 March 2023.






29.
Being dissatisfied with the Respondent decisions dated 26
th
 June 2021, 18
th
 November 2021 and 21
st
 March 2023, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 23
rd
 June 2023.






30.
For an Appeal before the Tribunal to be deemed as properly instituted and/or lodged, the Appellant ought to present the Appeal in conformity with the provisions of Section 13(1) of the Tax Appeals Tribunals (TAT) Act as read together with Section 52(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, which Sections provides as follows:-
“
13
(1)
A notice of appeal to the Tribunal shall –
(a)
be in writing or through electronic means;
(b)
be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner”
“52
(1)
A person who is dissatisfied with an appealable decision may appeal the decision to the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
, 2013”






31.
A perusal of the documentation presented by the Appellant, particularly the Notice of Appeal, the Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts, the Tribunal notes that the Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal together with its Appeal documents on 23
rd
 June 2023.






32.
Accordingly, the Appellant ought to have instituted its Appeal by lodging a Notice of Appeal within thirty days of the date of issuance and service of the Respondent’s decisions and filed the Appeal documents outlined under Section 13(2) of the TAT Act within fourteen (14) days of the date of lodging the Notice of Appeal.






33.
The Appellant ought to have lodged its Appeal on or before the 30
th
 June 2022 but failed to do so.






34.
There exists provisions of law that offer remedy to an Appellant who intends to lodge an Appeal beyond the statutory timelines, under Section 13(3) of the TAT Act, which makes such provisions and such an Appellant could seek leave of the Tribunal to regularize such lateness, the Appellant however failed to do so.






35.
The Tribunal refers to the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. The 
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No. 247 of 2020
] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -
“
Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”






36.
The Tribunal is further guided by TAT Appeal No. 1321 of 2022 CKL Africa Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes where it was held as thus: -
“
63.
The law makes provisions under Section 13 (3) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 for any party who lodges its appeal out of time and with reasonable grounds, to seek leave of the Tribunal to file its appeal out if time, the Appellant did not move the Tribunal seeking such Orders.
64.
The timelines provided under Section 47 (13) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and Section 13 (1) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 demand strict adherence and are not discretional to any party lodging an appeal before the Tribunal.
65.
It is the Tribunal’s position that there is no proper and valid Appeal before the Tribunal for the exercise of its jurisdiction.”






37.
The Tribunal holds the view that there is no proper Appeal before it to exercise its jurisdiction as the instant Appeal was filed out of time and without leave to file the Appeal outside the mandatory statutory timelines.






38.
The Tribunal having established that there is no valid Appeal on record consequently finds that the Appeal herein is incompetent and untenable in law.








Final Decision


39.
The upshot to the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is incompetent and the Tribunal consequently makes the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.
b.
Each party to bear its own costs.






40.
It is so ordered.

Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, and the Kenya Revenue Authority is charged with the responsibility of among others, assessment, collection, accounting and the general administration of tax revenue on behalf of the Government of Kenya.






3.
The Respondent issued assessments relating to VAT for the year 2017 on 19
th
 January, 2023 and Income tax for 2018 and 2019 on 25
th
 January, 2023






4.
The Appellant objected to the assessments on 15
th
 and 22
nd
 February, 2023.






5.
The Respondent issued an objection decision on 31
st
 March, 2023.






6.
The Appellant being dissatisfied with the objection decision, filed the Notice of Appeal dated 11
th
 May, 2023.




The Appeal


7.
The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Memorandum of Appeal dated and filed on 25
th
 May, 2023:
a.
That the Respondent erred and misdirected itself in allowing an assessment of Kshs. 97,399,333.76 in Corporation tax and VAT inclusive of interest and penalties.
b.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in misapprehending the Appellant's production process, thereby arriving at an erroneous decision.
c.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in disregarding the Appellant's stock adjustments which are an integral part of its accounting practices and in line with international accounting standards.
d.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in upholding an assessment that is based on estimated/expected sales rather than actual sales thereby subjecting the Appellant to taxes on revenue over and above what was actually earned contrary to Section 3(1)and 3(2) of the 
Income Tax Act
.
e.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in purporting to use provisional values rather than actual values which is not permissible in the computation of tax.
f.
That the Respondent erred in law and in fact in applying estimates of stocks used in production of finished goods, the ultimate effect of which would be the deduction of expenditure not wholly and exclusively incurred in production of income contrary to the clear provisions of Section 15(1) of the 
Income Tax Act
.
g.
That the Respondent erred in disallowing the decrease in provision of impaired receivables in respect of a debt that is deductible within the provisions of Section 15(2)(a) of the 
Income Tax Act
 as read with 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
.




Appellant’s Case


8.
The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents:
a.
The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated and filed on 25
th
 May, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.
b.
The Appellant’s witness statement of Maryam Salim dated 13
th
 February, 2024 and filed on 15
th
 February, 2024 that was admitted in evidence under oath on 26
th
 March, 2024.
c.
The Appellant’s written submissions dated 9
th
 April, 2024 and filed on 10
th
 April, 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.






9.
That by a letter dated 23
rd
 June, 2021, the Appellant addressed each of the issues raised by the Respondent in its audit findings and provided supporting documentation.






10.
That on 25
th
 June, 2021, KRA held a meeting with the Appellant for purposes of reviewing the tax audit findings and allowing the Appellant's representatives to explain the Appellant's position.






11.
That subsequently, by a letter dated 26
th
 July, 2022, KRA communicated the outcome of its audit findings, reducing the outstanding issues to the following:
a.
Production analysis - KRA indicated that it had applied an input-output methodology to ascertain the correctness of sales declared, which involved a comparison between the quantity of crude palm oil used in production, the total production in weight and the acceptable yield rates. KRA's conclusion based on this analysis was that for the period 2016 to 2019, there were under-declared sales as there was a variance between expected sales and declared sales.
b.
Sales and VAT reconciliation - KRA found that there were variances between accounts sales and VAT sales for the years 2018 and 2019 and brought the variances to charge.
c.
Disallowed expenses - KRA disallowed stock variances amounting to Kshs. 18,995,606.00 for the year 2018 stating that the variances were not adequately supported and decrease in provision for impaired receivables from Nakumatt supplies amounting to Kshs. 60,211,397.00 on the basis that it did not meet the threshold set in 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
.
d.
Overclaimed staff costs - KRA indicated that a reconciliation between the salaries and wages declared in PAYE returns and those in the Appellant's accounts showed an overclaim of expenses, which was disallowed and subjected to tax.






12.
That based on its analysis, KRA concluded that Corporation tax of Kshs. 129,704,554.00 and VAT of Kshs. 34,431,730.00 inclusive of interest and penalties was due from the Appellant.






13.
That by a letter dated 19
th
 August, 2022, the Appellant responded to the outstanding issues communicated by KRA, explaining that:
a.
KRA erroneously applied acceptable yields, in this case standard yield rates, without appreciating the fact that yields could not be constant due to the nature of the raw material and the Appellant's manufacturing process. The Appellant outlined the reasons for variances in production yields and explained that the variances noted by KRA were purely normal production process losses and not underdeclared sales. Further, the Appellant provided a summary of its input-output analysis for the period 2016 to 2019 which demonstrated that the raw material was fully accounted for during the period under review and that there were no underdeclared sales.
b.
A reconciliation of sales as per financial statements and as per VAT returns showed that there were no variances contrary to KRA's allegation.
c.
The stock variances in the Appellant's accounts related to soap stock-take done at the end of 2018 and posted in the provisions account since the inventory ledgers had been closed. Subsequently, the provision was reversed in 2019 and adjustments done in the inventory ledger.
d.
The decrease in provision for impaired receivables related to Kshs. 60,211,397.00 due from Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, which amount was provided for in 2017 and disallowed. Nakumatt was then placed under administration in 2018 and the Appellant allowed the amount back in its tax computation as per Section 15(a) of the 
Income Tax Act
 (""ITA"") as read with paragraph 2(d) of 
Legal Notice No.37 of 2011
.
e.
A summary of the fully reconciled wages and salaries as per the Appellant's financial statements and PAYE returns showed that there were no variances.






14.
That on 27
th
 September, 2022, KRA communicated its final findings, upholding its position on two issues: the production analysis and the disallowed bad debts expense/decrease in provision for impaired receivables. That the issues relating to sales and VAT reconciliations, stock variances and overclaimed staff costs were vacated. That KRA indicated that it would issue assessments in respect of taxes amounting to Kshs. 153,016,231.00 being Corporation tax and VAT together with penalties and interest.






15.
That following KRA's communication of its findings, the Appellant held a meeting with KRA to further explain the issues of production analysis and decrease in provision for impaired receivables. That KRA however maintained its position and issued the following additional assessments: VAT for 2017 amounting to Kshs. 9,853,582.62, Corporation tax for 2018 amounting to Kshs. 21,668,821.03 and Corporation tax for 2019 amounting to Kshs. 27,182,606.84.






16.
That the Appellant, being dissatisfied with KRA's assessments, lodged objections dated 15
th
 February, 2023 in respect of the assessments for the periods 2018 and 2019 and dated 22
nd
 February 2023 for the period 2017; highlighting the following as its grounds for objection:
a.
The Respondent erred in disregarding stock adjustments and failing to consider the Appellant's production process. The Appellant extensively explained its production process and the factors that affect product yields at each stage of production. The Appellant elaborated on the reasons why the yield from each batch of raw materials cannot be estimated with certainty. The Respondent's conclusion that there were under-declared sales was therefore based on the application of estimated product yield rather than actual product yield.
b.
The Respondent failed to consider the Appellant's accounting practices and therefore disallowed the stock adjustments made by the Appellant in its financial statements, leading to the erroneous conclusion that there were under-declared sales. The Appellant explained that the stock adjustments were necessary for matching revenues and the cost of production of goods.
c.
The Respondent disregarded several income tax provisions by applying provisional values instead of actual values, deducting expenditure that was not wholly and fully incurred in production of income and imposing tax on expected sales instead of actual sales.
d.
The Respondent erred in disallowing the decrease in provision for impaired receivables for the year 2018 as it failed to consider that Nakumatt Holdings Ltd was adjudged insolvent and the debt was therefore uncollectable within the meaning of Section 15(2)(a) of the ITA as read with 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
.






17.
That on 23
rd
 February, 2023, the Respondent requested for further documents, being the Appellant's financial statements for the years under review, copies of the notices of objection and an input-output reconciliation and the Appellant provided the documents on 28
th
 February, 2023.






18.
That by a letter dated 31
st
 March, 2023 sent to the Appellant via email on 11
th
 April 2023, the Respondent issued an objection decision in which it stated that:
a.
The assessing Commissioner accounted for the factors set out in the objection when conducting the production analysis and the input-output methodology was used to test the accuracy of the taxpayer's deductions.
b.
The Respondent applied an allowable loss of between 5.82% and 6.34% to arrive at the expected RBD yield.
c.
The ground of objection in respect of supplies made to Nakumatt Holdings Ltd did not meet the threshold in 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
.
d.
The Respondent therefore upheld the assessments in the cumulative amount of Kshs. 97,399,333.76 inclusive of penalties and interest.






19.
That the Respondent's objection decision is erroneous for the following reasons:
Failure to consider the Appellant's production process
a.
The Appellant's production process involves first refining of crude palm oil (CPO) to produce refined, bleached and deodorized oil (RBD), with Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) and Biox as by-products. The RBD then undergoes fractionation to produce olein and stearin, which are the finished products. Thatbowing to the continuous production process, the Appellant estimates the RBD yield that would be produced from a specific amount of CPO and the finished goods that would be expected from a specific quantity of RBD. That the Appellant then does quarterly stock takes to establish the actual amounts of finished goods, RBD and CPO and accounts for the process losses by making stock adjustments in its accounts.
b.
That the Respondent disregarded the process losses that are inherent in the Appellant's production process despite several explanations by the Appellant, and instead applied the estimated production yields for each year of production to arrive at expected sales. That the expected sales do not take into account the process losses and the actual quantities of finished products which were duly accounted for and declared by the Appellant.
c.
That the Appellant specifically explained that the RBD yield from a specific quantity of CPO is not constant and varies based on:
i.
The quality of CPO used, which fluctuates from season to season and from one batch to another - a lower quality batch produces a lower amount of RBD.
ii.
The moisture level in the CPO - a higher amount of moisture leads to a lower yield of RBD and PFAD.
iii.
The quantity of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) in the CPO - where FFAs are higher, the RBD yield will be lower.
iv.
Tank temperatures - where the temperatures in the CPO tanks are high, the amount of FFAs will increase, leading to a low RBD yield.
v.
Deodorizer temperatures - higher deodorizer temperatures lead to a lower RBD yield.
vi.
Scrubbing temperatures - scrubbing utilizes steam drawn from the top of the deodorizer. The scrubbing temperatures therefore influence the recovery of vapors and if condensation is not effective, it leads to higher losses of PFAD and any neutral oil that is trapped in the FFA steam, thus negatively affecting the RBD yield.
vii.
System vacuum - inadequate vacuum leads to higher FFA and a lower RBD yield.
viii.
Interruption of runs - where there are power cuts or equipment breakdown, the stability of the system is affected, leading to unstable RBD yields.
ix.
Plant age and capacity utilization - the refinery plant used in the period under review was old having been in use for around 16 years. To meet product demand, the plant was upgraded several times in 2010 and 2016, which impacted its efficiency since it was pushed beyond its normal production levels, leading to high process losses. By contrast, following the installation of a new refinery plant in December 2020, efficiency has increased and yields have significantly improved.
d.
Similarly, the quantity of finished goods produced from a specific amount of RBD varies due to process losses that result from:
i.
Accuracy of filling line weight determination.
ii.
Variances caused by the filling nozzles.
iii.
High temperatures during fractionation.
e.
As such, simply applying predetermined expected product yields is not an accurate measure of the production quantities and therefore cannot be a true account of sales volumes or a basis for concluding that there were undeclared sales.
f.
Additionally, the Respondent's indication in its objection decision that it applied an allowable loss of 5.82% and 6.34% to the CPO available for production is false. The 5.82% and 6.34% include PFAD, Biox and process loss. This means that process losses, which are accounted for by the Appellant, were less than 1% during the period under review. That this is clear from the Appellant's input-output reconciliation that it attached to its pleadings.
Failure to consider the Appellant's accounting practices
g.
The Respondent, in its findings dated 27
th
 September, 2022, omitted the Appellant's stock adjustments.
h.
That the effect of the Respondent's omission of the Appellant's stock adjustments is that the process losses explained above were not taken into account.
i.
That due to the continuous nature of the Appellant's production process, it has adopted the use of a pre-determined standard production yield for day-to-day accounting of production quantities which are usually estimates. That it then conducts periodic stock takes to determine the actual production yields.
j.
That in 2017, the standard/estimated RBD yields expected from processing of CPO were 94.71% for half one and 94.03% for half two bringing the weighted average for the year to 94.18%. That the Appellant therefore used the pre-determined standard production yield (Bill of Materials) to record all production during the year 2017 in its ERP system. That the manufacturing process was recorded as follows:
i.
CPO tanks to refinery - CPO that is piped to the refinery is measured using flowmeters or tank dips and the CPO quantity used to estimate the RBD, Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) and Biox produced as well as process losses.
ii.
Fractionation - The RBD piped to the fractionation plant is measured using flowmeters or tank dips and used to estimate the olein and stearin produced.
k.
That in 2018, the standard RBD yields were 93.14% for half one and 93.77% for half two, bringing the weighted average for the year to 93.46%. That in 2019 the standard RBD yields were 93.77% for half one and 93.13% for half two, bringing the weighted average to 93.40%. That for both 2018 and 2019, the Appellant also used the pre-determined standard production yield (Bill of Materials) to record all production in its ERP System. That the manufacturing process for 2018 and 2019 was recorded as follows:
i.
Refinery - RBD produced from the refinery was measured using flowmeters and used to estimate the CPO used, Biox and PFAD produced and the process loss.
ii.
Fractionation - Olein quantity produced was measured using flowmeters or tank dips and used to estimate the RBD utilized.
l.
That it is therefore clear that for the years under review, the production quantities recorded in the manufacturer's ERP system constituted various estimates based on pre-determined standard production yields. That this necessitated the use of stock adjustments to reconcile the actual stock quantities.
m.
That the Appellant conducts stock takes at least once quarterly, at which point all production processes are halted and actual measurements taken. That in view of the variances that are inevitable in the production process due to process losses, the actual stock quantities are usually different from the estimates. That this necessitates a reconciliation of stocks, which is done by way of stock adjustment entries. That the purpose of the stock adjustments is to ensure that the recorded stock (based on estimates) tallies with the actual stocks as counted and determined during the stock takes.
n.
That the use of stock adjustments in financial statements is in line with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1.27 which requires entities to prepare their financial statements using the accrual basis of accounting. That the adjustments are made for the purpose of matching revenues and the cost of production of the goods. That further, the stock adjustments are in compliance with IAS 8.36 and 8.37 which provide the following:
“
The effect of a change in an accounting estimate shall be recognised prospectively by including it in profit or loss in: [IAS 8.36]
·the period of the change, if the change affects that period only, or
· the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
However, to the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, it is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability, or equity item in the period of the change. [IAS 8.37]”
o.
That the Respondent's application of the input-output methodology ought to take into account the fact that whereas there are predetermined product yields, there are still process losses that have to be considered and necessary stock adjustments made to reconcile the estimates of quantities with the actual quantities recorded during stock takes.
p.
That it is important to note that the Respondent's reference to ""acceptable yield rates"" and “allowable losses"" was not based on any industrially accepted standards but was drawn from the Appellant's projected yield rates (indicated as average standard yields).
q.
That the Appellant demonstrated that the process losses for the years under review were minimal and below industry standard process loss as shown below:
Net Stocks Adjustment

r.
That it is clear from the foregoing that the Appellant maintained an accurate record of the quantities of actual finished goods produced as well as the volume of sales that took place within each year of review.
s.
That the expected sales quantities which the Respondent used are an estimate or projection based on the standard yields and does not reflect the actual sales based on the actual production yields. That the Respondent therefore based its conclusion and assessment on expected sales, which are estimates, rather than actual sales recorded and declared by the Appellant. That the point of focus when determining the Appellant's income should be the actual sales made by the Appellant, which it duly declared.
t.
That notably, as part of the audit process, the Respondent conducted a systems audit, which would have revealed undeclared sales if there were any. That the Respondent did not find any discrepancies and as such, its conclusions are unjustified.
Disallowing decrease in provision for impaired receivables
u.
That the Appellant clearly explained that in 2017, it had provided for the amount of Kshs. 60,211,397.00 which arose from one account receivable, that is Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, but the same had been disallowed in that year. That subsequently, when Nakumatt Holdings was placed under administration, the Appellant allowed the amount back as per Section 15(2)(a) of the 
Income Tax Act
 as read with 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
. That the Respondent therefore erred in disallowing the amount, which was justified and is uncollectable.
1.
That the Appellant’s witness explained that the stock adjustments made usually net off to a negligible amount, as the figures are adjusted downwards at one stage of the production process, and subsequently upwards at another stage, and vice versa.
2.
That the Appellant’s computation ought to be considered holistically, just as the production process is a holistic, integrated and seamless process. That the process losses reflected in the Appellant’s computation are less than 1% of the stocks handled, as reflected in the production process loss analysis provided in the Appellant’s bundle of documents.
3.
That it is important to note that the process losses reflected in the stock adjustments made by the Appellant amounted to 0.32%, 0.49% and 0.35% of the stocks handled by the Appellant for the respective years of income. That adding these to the process losses estimated at refining stage brings the total percentages to 0.62%, 0.79% and 0.77%, which are a very small fraction of the stocks handled and within the acceptable industry standard process losses of 1%. That as explained by the Appellant’s witness, the process losses clearly net off to a negligible percentage, which is close to zero.
4.
That notably, an almost similar result is reflected in the Respondent’s computation, when the Appellant’s alleged undeclared sales are compared to the declared sales of finished products with variances of 0.41, 0.59 and 0.42 for the years of income 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.
5.
That even going further, to demonstrate this fact, the revenues realized by the Appellant, as reported in its financial statements, were Kshs. 18,274,670,596.00 in 2017, Kshs. 17,254,034,653.00 in 2018 and Kshs. 19,254,040,980.00 in 2019. That the Appellant declared these sales and duly paid VAT and Corporation taxes arising from the sales. That when compared to the alleged under-declared sales, the result still demonstrates that these were computed figures that almost tally with the process losses that the Respondent has purported to exclude from its computation.
6.
That it is clear from the foregoing that the stock adjustments made by the Appellant were within acceptable levels, noting the Appellant’s huge production volumes, as the net effect was an adjustment of less than 1%.
7.
That the Respondent’s witness testified that the basis of the assessment was that, for instance, in 2019, there was a downward stock adjustment at CPO level. That what the Respondent omitted to note was that in that year of income, positive RBD, Olein and Stearin adjustments were made, which therefore netted off the total stock adjustments to 0.35%. That the Respondent clearly did not review the Appellant’s computations from a holistic standpoint, which is necessary as its production process is continuous and very much integrated.
8.
That notably, one of the issues raised was stock adjustments recorded in its books, which was raised as a separate issue from production analysis. That the Appellant was called upon to explain the adjustments, which it did, and this issue was omitted from the subsequent findings. That this goes to show that the Appellant satisfactorily explained the need for stock adjustments, and the Respondent was satisfied with the Appellant’s position and found that this was no longer an issue to further consider. That it is therefore absurd that the Respondent, on the one hand, accepted the use of stock adjustments by the Appellant, and on the other hand omitted them from its computations on the production analysis.
9.
That whereas the Appellant uses estimates during the production process, the finished goods, and consequently the sales declared are actual volumes and not estimates. That this was confirmed by the Appellant’s witness, who explained that in terms of the finished goods, the actual volumes are reported, and actual sales declared. That in this regard, the Appellant’s declared sales are a true reflection of what was actually sold to consumers, which is reflected in its financial statements and in its tax returns. That it follows that there was no under-declaration of sales at any point whatsoever, as the actual goods sold were duly reported and declared.
10.
That the imposition of tax under Section 3(1) and 3(2)(a) is based on actual gains or profits and not estimates/projected income. That taxation on expected sales is unfair, unreasonable and unjust as it subjects the Appellant to taxes on revenue over and above what was actually earned.
11.
That the Respondent is purporting to use provisional instead of actual values, which is not acceptable in the computation of tax. That as such, the issuance of an assessment based on expected sales rather than actual sales is erroneous and should not be allowed.
12.
The Appellant submitted that it clearly explained that it applied estimates of stock used in production, which then necessitated adjustments following stock takes. That the ultimate effect of the Respondent disregarding stock adjustments and applying estimates of stock used in production of finished goods is that estimated, rather than actual expenditure, that is not wholly and exclusively incurred for the production of income, would be deducted, contrary to Section 15(1) and 16(1)(a)of the ITA.
13.
That with regard to the decrease in provision for impaired receivables, Section 15(2)(a) provides that in the computation of gains and profits for a year of income, debts which have become bad or doubtful shall be deducted. That 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
 provides guidelines on bad debts as follows:
“
1.
A debt shall be considered to have become bad if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have become uncollectable after all reasonable steps have been taken to collect it.
2.
A debt shall be deemed to have become uncollectable under paragraph (1) where
(a)
the creditor loses the contractual right that comprises the debt through a court order;
(b)
no form of security or collateral is realisable whether partially or in full;
(c)
the securities or collateral have been realized but the proceeds fail to cover the entire debt;
(d)
the debtor is adjudged insolvent or bankrupt by a court of law;
(e)
the costs of recovering the debt exceeds the debt itself; or
(f)
efforts to collect the debt are abandoned for another reasonable cause.
3.
A bad debt shall be a deductible expense only if it is wholly and exclusively incurred in the normal course of business.
4.
F or the purposes of these guidelines, a bad debt which is of a capital nature shall not be an allowable expense.”






33.
That the debt due from Nakumatt Holdings Limited fits squarely within the definition of a bad debt as:
a.
The debt became uncollectable as Nakumatt was unable to pay its debts and insolvency proceedings were commenced against it. This was ruled in Insolvency Cause No. 10 of 2017 in which Nakumatt was then adjudged insolvent. In a ruling delivered on 22
nd
 January, 2018, the Court, at paragraph 
88
, acknowledged that Nakumatt was insolvent and that the administration order issued was under the heading “Administration of Insolvent Companies” under the 
Insolvency Act
.
b.
The Appellant duly lodged its claim with Nakumatt's administrator on 2
nd
 February, 2018 following the issuance of the ruling but was unable to recover the debt.
c.
The Appellant did not hold any form of realizable security or collateral in respect of the debt. That the debt was incurred from the supply of finished products by the Appellant which ordinarily do not require the deposit of security to secure payment. That the Appellant was therefore an unsecured creditor.
d.
That the debt was incurred wholly and exclusively in the normal course of business, that is, supply of the Appellant's products to Nakumatt for resale.
e.
That the debt was not of a capital nature.






34.
That the Respondent's conclusion that the debt did not meet the requirements under 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
 was therefore without basis and should not be allowed to stand.






35.
That in refuting the Appellant’s computation of income, the Respondent was not exercising best judgment, contrary to the provisions of Section 31(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, which provides that:
“
Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the “original assessment"") by making alterations or additions, from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner's judgement, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period…”






36.
That the Respondent did not apply itself to all the available information provided by the Appellant. That the Appellant provided extensive information and repeated its explanations on the production process multiple times during the audit period. That the Respondent blatantly ignored the Appellant’s explanations and went on a tangent of its own, leading to an assessment that is unreasonable and unjustified.






37.
That further, the Respondent has indicated severally that the input-output methodology is a viable test for measuring the accuracy of a taxpayer’s records. That what the Respondent failed to do is to point to any enabling law or at the very least, any internationally acceptable guidelines that provide for the use of this methodology, the circumstances under which it may be used and any parameters to measure the reliability of the test.






38.
That the Respondent’s witness further noted that there were no discrepancies whatsoever in the Appellant’s systems and records that pointed to an under-declaration of sales, save for the results of the input-output methodology applied by the Respondent. That indeed, there was no concrete evidence to support the Respondent’s assessment. That the Respondent applied all credibility checks to the Appellant’s records and did not find any fault whatsoever that would have supported its position that the Appellant failed to declare some of its sales.






39.
The Appellant submitted that if indeed there were sales that were not declared, the same would have been manifestly clear from its audited systems and records. That nothing would have been easier than for the Respondent to point out evidence that there were some sales that the Appellant had failed to declare.






40.
That the Appellant’s witness was questioned on whether management reports and laboratory reports addressing the process losses were provided. That in response, she indicated that these reports were at all times available for the Respondent’s review. That the non-conformance reports (NCRs) were in fact provided during the audit, as well as all computations relating to its production process.






41.
That further, the Respondent’s witness confirmed, as indicated in the objection decision, that all the documents that the Respondent’s team requested for in the course of the audit were provided and reviewed.






42.
That the Appellant fully co-operated with the Respondent’s team at all times during and after the audit, and there is no indication by the Respondent whatsoever, either in its findings or the objection decision, that there were any documents that it intended to review that were not provided.






43.
That Section 59(1)(a) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 clearly delineates the procedure to be followed in requesting for documentation from taxpayers as follows:
“
For the purposes of obtaining full information in respect of the tax liability of any person or class of persons, or for any other purposes relating to a tax law, the Commissioner or an authorised officer may require any person, by notice in writing, to—
(a)
produce for examination, at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, an documents (including in electronic format) that are in the person's custody or under the person's control relating to the tax liability of any person;”






44.
That to the extent that the Respondent did not request for any further documents in the course of the audit, it cannot now cast aspersions on the Appellant, who co-operated fully with the Respondent’s team. That the Respondent’s questioning during the hearing was therefore an afterthought as all the documents requested for were provided at both the audit and objection review stage.






45.
The Appellant submitted, that in any event, all the relevant documents that support its position were duly provided and are also before this Tribunal. That it is the Respondent that failed to consider them in a rational manner leading to an unfair inference.






46.
That once the Appellant provided all the relevant documentation and explanations to the Respondent, it was for the Respondent to rebut the Appellant’s position, with sufficient reasons for departing from what the documents demonstrated.






47.
The Appellant relied on the case of Kenya Revenue Authority v Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR, where the High Court, in finding that the taxpayer had discharged its burden of proof and stated the following:
“
38.
As I observed in ITA No 078 of 2020, “Burden of Proof” is a legal term used to assign evidentiary responsibilities to parties in litigation. The party that carries the burden of proof must produce evidence to meet a threshold or “standard” in order to prove their claim. If a party fails to meet their burden of proof, their claim will fail. “Burden of Proof” at the Tax Court is somewhat unique. At the Tax Court, a taxpayer is required to disprove an assessment by the Commissioner. In other words, a Tax payer challenging a tax assessment will need to collect and present evidence in order to disprove the Commissioner’s position. This is the basic principle. However, there are some situations where this responsibility or “onus” is reversed. The onus may also shift based on the stage of the proceedings and the actions taken by the parties.
39.
The Supreme Court of Canada in Johnston v Minister of National Revenue[18] decided that the onus is on the taxpayer to “demolish the basic fact on which the taxation rested.” Also, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on this issue in Hickman Motors Ltd. v Canada[19] that the onus is met when a Taxpayer makes out at least a prima facie case. Prima facie is another legal term that literally means “on its face.” To prove a case “on its face” you must provide evidence that, unless rebutted, would prove your position. According to the said decision, a prima facie case is made when the taxpayer can produce unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence. Once the taxpayer has made out a prima facie case to prove the facts, the onus then shifts to the Revenue Authority to rebut the prima facie case. If the Revenue Authority cannot provide any evidence to prove their position, the taxpayer will succeed.”






48.
That the Appellant, therefore, at that point, had discharged its burden of proof on a prima facie basis. That it was then imperative on the Respondent to prove that its allegations had a legal and factual basis and to support its position. That the Respondent has not done that. That it instead has insisted on the input-output methodology, which does not have any legal backing.






49.
That the case of Cussens v Revenue Authority [2019] TC 07337, is instructive on the exercise of best judgment by a revenue authority. That the Court cited with approval the case of Johnson v Scott [1978] STC 48 as follows:
“
…But what the Crown has to do in such a situation is, on the known facts, to make reasonable inferences … the Inspector’s figures … ought to be - fair. The fact that the onus is on the taxpayer to displace the assessment is not intended to give the Crown carte blanche to make wild or extravagant claims. Where an inference, of whatever nature, falls to be made, one invariably speaks of a `fair’ inference. Where, as is the case in this matter, figures have to be inferred, what has to be made is a `fair’ inference as to what such figures may have been. The figures themselves must be fair”.






50.
That the Court went further to state that when considering whether assessments have been made based on fair inferences drawn from established facts or to the best judgment, it considers, inter alia, whether the Respondent made a value judgment based on the material available and whether the assessment is wholly unreasonable.






51.
The Appellant also relied on the following cases to buttress its arguments:
a.
Republic v Kenya Revenue Authority Ex parte Jaffer Mujtab Mohamed [2015] eKLR on the finding that the authority must exercise its powers fairly and there ought to be a basis for the exercise of such powers
b.
M-Kopa LLC (C/O M-Kopa Kenya Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes (Tax Appeal No. 65 of 2023
) to support the listing under Section 3(2) of the ITA on income chargeable to tax.
c.
Republic v Kenya Revenue Authority ex-parte Bata Shoe Company (Kenya) Limited (2014) eKLR, where the Court emphasized that “...a taxpayer is not
obliged to pay a single coin more than is due to the taxman.”
d.
Insolvency Cause No. 10 of 2017 where the High Court pronounced itself on insolvent companies and the issue of bad debts.






Appellant’s Prayers


52.
The Appellant prayed that:
a.
The Appeal herein be allowed and the Respondent's audit findings dated 27
th
 September, 2022, the Respondent's assessments issued on 19
th
 January, 2023 and 25
th
 January, 2023 and the Respondent's objection decision dated 31
st
 March, 2023 be set aside in their entirety.
b.
The Respondent, its employees, agents or other persons purporting to act on its behalf be barred and/or estopped from demanding or taking any further steps towards enforcement or recovery of principal tax, penalties and interest on the assessments issued.
c.
The costs of this Appeal be borne by the Respondent.








Respondent’s Case


53.
The Respondent’s case is premised on:
a.
Its Statement of Facts dated 15
th
 August, 2023 and filed on 22
nd
 August, 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.
b.
The Witness statement of Madeleine Irungu dated 27
th
 February, 2-24 and filed on 3
rd
 March, 2024 that was admitted in evidence under oath on the 26
th
 March, 2024
c.
The Respondent’s written submissions dated 10
th
 April. 2024 together with the authorities attached thereto.






54.
That the Respondent is allowed by Section 24(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to assess a taxpayer's liability using any information available to it. That to this extent, the Respondent confirms to have operated within the confines of the law by using the data available following a return review for the 
period of 2017
 for VAT declarations and 2018-2019 period for Income Tax.






55.
The Respondent averred that it is allowed to make additional assessments based on the available information to the best of its judgment pursuant to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






56.
That the Respondent conducted an analysis which involved the establishment of the quantity of crude palm oil subjected to the refinery and fractionation to produce oil, fats, and soap as a by-product.






57.
The Respondent stated that the total production in weight was obtained and the acceptable yield rates were used to determine the possibilities of under-declared sales.






58.
The Respondent noted that an allowable loss of between 5.82% and 6.34% was applied on the CPO available for production thereby arriving at a reduced RBD yield that accounted for the various elements that would affect the production yield.






59.
That from the foregoing, it was evident that the Respondent accounted for the various factors alluded to in the Appellant’s objection application and thereby this objection ground did not succeed.






60.
That in addition, the input-output methodology of determining expected sales is a viable test of the accuracy of the Appellant's records. That the Respondent, by applying the same and allowing some margin for waste and loss would expect to arrive at a relatively close number to the declared sales but instead established a variance.






61.
That the variance observed is therefore, not a means by the Respondent to forego tax norms and rules but rather simply a means to test the accuracy of the Appellant's declarations, which in this case were found to have some variances which were subsequently brought to charge.






62.
That in this respect too, the Appellant's objection grounds did not succeed. That it is based on the above observations that the Respondent rejected the Appellant's ground of objection to this particular item.






63.
That on the Appellant's ground of objection that bad debts in respect of supplies made to Nakumatt Holdings had met the requirements of 
LN 37 of 2011
, the Respondent examined and the debt was found to not have met the threshold set out therein (
LN 37 of 2011
), in addition to not being fully supported in the absence of the Court order or judgement clearly setting out the status of the debtor amongst other conditions.






64.
That the Appellant's evidence to support its position was not sufficient to vary the Respondent's assessment. It was the Respondent's further averment that it did nor err in law or fact in confirming the VAT and Income Tax due.






65.
That the Respondent is guided by Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 which provides that:
“
in any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”








Issues For Determination


66.
The Tribunal has considered the pleadings, submissions and the evidence adduced by both parties and is of the view that the issue falling for its determination is:-






Whether the Respondent’s assessment was justified


Analysis And Findings


67.
The Tribunal having established the issue falling for its determination, proceeds to analyse the same as hereunder.






68.
The Appellant argued that the Respondent disregarded its explanations and the documents it submitted which led to an erroneous decision.






69.
The Respondent on its part averred that it made its decision based on the available information to the best of its judgement pursuant to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






70.
The Tribunal having reviewed the parties pleadings, submissions and testimony of the witnesses proceeds to analyse the matters in contention as follows:
Corporation Tax
a.
Production Analysis
1.
The contention between the parties in relation to production analysis is whether the Commissioner’s use of input-output analysis is a valid basis for determining sales chargeable to tax.
2.
From the pleadings, the Tribunal observes that the Appellant provided its production processes both in its pleadings as well as through the testimony of its witness. The Tribunal notes that owing to the continuous nature of the production process, the Appellant typically estimates the refined, bleached and deodorized oil (RBD) that would be produced from the refining of crude palm oil (CPO) and the expected finished products from a specific quantity of RBD.
3.
The Tribunal further notes that the above estimates are necessitated by various factors including the fluctuations in the quality of CPO used from season to season as a lower quality batch of CPO produces a lower amount of RBD. Further, the moisture level in the CPO, the quantity of free fatty acids in the CPO, tank temperatures in the CPO tanks, deodorizer temperatures, scrubbing temperatures, interruptions of runs and plant age and capacity utilization are all factors that affect the final RBD yield from batch to batch.
4.
The Tribunal further established that to get actual quantities after production and based on the above varying factors, the Appellant undertakes quarterly stock takes in which it establishes the actual amounts of finished goods produced, RBD and CPO and in this way accounts for any variances by making stock adjustments which then result in adjustments in its accounts.
5.
The Appellant, in its pleadings, provided the following documents:-
i.
An input-output reconciliation for the years 2017 to 2019 that depicted the following:
a.
Opening stocks, closing stocks, purchases, transfers to soap production, sale and stock adjustments of CPO.
b.
The available CPO for production.
c.
The RBD yield, opening stocks, closing stocks and stock adjustments of RBD.
d.
Transfers of RBD to Kikambala and RBD sold.
e.
Details of RBD fractionating into olein and stearin.
f.
Production for sale in kilograms.
g.
Expected sales vis a vis declared sales of finished products.
h.
Other yield/ production differences.
i.
Stock adjustments of CPO, RBD and olein.
j.
The production process loss adjustment that resulted in variances of 0.32, 0.49 and 0.35 for 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.
i.
Sample journal entries showing the inventory adjustments for the three years in dispute.
ii.
The company financial statements for the years under dispute.
1.
The Tribunal notes from the pleadings that while the Appellant worked with initial estimates of expected production based on pre-determined standard production yields, the Appellant undertook stock adjustments and computation of actual input and output to establish the actual production and sales which it used in its declarations in its financial statements.
2.
The Tribunal has further established that the assessed taxes by the Respondent were based on an input-output analysis that was based on acceptable yield rates and allowable losses which the Respondent drew from the Appellant’s projected yield rates that were part of the Appellant’s input-output analysis. This was confirmed by the Respondent’s witness who testified and confirmed that the Respondent was “taxing expected sales”.
3.
Having reviewed the parties’ positions holistically, the Tribunal affirms that the Appellant provided detailed information supporting its position as well as the sales it declared for tax. The Tribunal has in this regard noted that the Respondent, while confirming its assessment, did not dispel the accuracy of the Appellant’s input-output analysis with its own computation on input-output to support the expected sales that it seeks to tax.
4.
Further, the Respondent, in its objection decision, simply stated that input-output methodology of determining expected sales is a viable test of accuracy of the Appellant’s records and that it applied the same and allowed for some margin of waste and loss and arrived at a relatively close number to the declared sales.
5.
In the instant case, the Tribunal has established that the Appellant provided the information required of it by the Respondent to support its actual production quantities as well as actual sales it made in support of its financial records and its tax declarations. Notably, while the Respondent stated that it applied an input-output methodology to ascertain the correctness of sales declared and applied the acceptable yield to determine under-declared sales, it did not address the input-output analysis provided by the Appellant nor specifically rebut the actual numbers provided in the said input-output analysis.
6.
Further, while the Appellant provided detailed journal entries of its stock adjustments, the Respondent did not address the same or rebut the position that these stock adjustments presented in relation to the final declarations.
7.
The Tribunal posits that it is now settled that the burden of proof in tax cases lies with the Appellant as is encapsulated in Section 30 of the TAT Act which states as follows:
“
In a proceeding before the Tribunal, the appellant has the burden of proving—
(a)
where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; or
(b)
in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”








83.
This onus may however shift to the Respondent if the Appellant has made a prima facie case. In this case, the onus may then shift to the Respondent to rebut the prima facie case failure to which the taxpayer succeeds.






84.
This position was explained in the case of Kenya Revenue Authority v Maluki Kitili Mwendwa [2021] eKLR, where Mativo J ( as he then was) adopted the doctrine in the Canadian Supreme Court case of Johnston v Minister of National Revenue {1948} S.C.R. 486 where the court stated that:
“
… the onus is on the taxpayer to “demolish the basic fact on which the taxation rested.” Again, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on this issue in Hickman Motors Ltd. v Canada which held that the onus is met when a Taxpayer makes out at least a prima facie case. Prima facie is another legal term that literally means “on its face.” To prove a case “on its face” you must provide evidence that, unless rebutted, would prove your position. According to the said decision, a prima facie case is made when the taxpayer can produce unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence. Once the taxpayer has made out a prima facie case to prove the facts, the onus then shifts to the Revenue Authority to rebut the prima facie case. If the Revenue Authority cannot provide any evidence to prove their position, the taxpayer will succeed.”






85.
From the above decision of the superior court, it is apparent that the Appellant was required to present a minimum amount of information and documents necessary to support its position. This safety valve seems to place the burden of proof on the Appellant without completely relieving the Respondent of its fair share of the burden of proof.






86.
The bottom line is that once the Appellant has provided evidence that the Respondent’s assessment was wrong, then the Respondent must push back and show that its assessment was not arbitrary, capricious or imagined. The pendulum (onus of proof) would swing back to the Appellant once the Respondent has discharged its burden on a balance of convenience.






87.
By tabling the documents that the Appellant did, the Appellant succeeded in making a prima facie case that its sales declarations are supported by its production processes and the related actual losses as demonstrated in its input-output analysis and the documents it supplied.






88.
The onus, therefore, shifted to the Respondent to disprove these documents by making a prima facie case that its tax assessments based on expected sales as opposed to actual sales was justified.






89.
The taxation of expected sales by the Respondent as confirmed by its witness is a contradiction to the well settled principle in taxation that a taxpayer should never be subjected to pay tax that is not due. This was discussed in Waweru & 3 others (suing as officials of Kitengela Bar Owners Association) & another v National Assembly & 2 others; Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) & 2 others (Interested Parties) (Constitutional Petition E005 & E001 (Consolidated) of 2021) [2021] KEHC 9748 (KLR) (20 September 2021) (Judgment) where Odunga J (as he then was) stated as follows:-
“
A taxpayer was not obliged to pay a single coin more than was due to the taxman. The taxman on the other hand was entitled to collect up to the last coin that was due from a taxpayer.”






90.
Based on the above and the Respondent’s witness’ confirmation that the Respondent was taxing expected sales and not actual sales, the Tribunal finds and holds that the Respondent did not discharge its onus of rebutting the prima facie case that had been made out by the Appellant. It merely relied on acceptable yield rates and allowable losses to compute expected sales that it based its tax assessments on.






91.
The Tribunal relies on the High Court decision regarding the swinging nature of the burden of proof in Kenya Revenue Authority v Man Diesel & Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR, where it was stated that:
“
Once the taxpayer has made out a prima facie case to prove the facts, the onus then shifts to the Revenue Authority to rebut the prima facie case. If the Revenue Authority cannot provide any evidence to prove their position, the taxpayer will succeed.”






92.
Flowing from the above analysis, the Tribunal finds and holds that the Appellant produced competent and relevant evidence to support its position. On the other hand, the Respondent failed to provide evidence to cast doubts on the Appellant’s evidence and to accordingly justify its decision.








b. Whether the Respondent was justified in disallowing the Appellant’s impaired receivables (bad debt)


93.
The Respondent stated that it examined a debt owed by Nakumatt Holdings Limited and it did not meet the threshold set out in Legal Notice Number 37 of 2011.






94.
It was the Appellant’s submission that it supplied its products to Nakumatt Holdings Limited (NHL) in the ordinary course of its business. That however, due to the fact that Nakumatt Holdings Limited was unable to meet its financial obligations and NHL was placed under administration the Appellant was unable to collect its debt after the pursuit of the same over the years.






95.
That further, the Appellant duly lodged its claim with Nakumatt’s administrator on 2
nd
 February, 2018 following the issuance of a ruling but was unable to recover the debt.






96.
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
 states as follows regarding provision for bad debt;
“
1.
A debt shall be considered to have become bad if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have become uncollectable after all reasonable steps have been taken to collect it.
2.
A debt shall be deemed to have become uncollectable under paragraph (1) where
(a)
the creditor loses the contractual right that comprises the debt through a court order;
(b)
no form of security or collateral is realisable whether partially or in full;
(c)
the securities or collateral have been realized but the proceeds fail to cover the entire debt;
(d)
the debtor is adjudged insolvent or bankrupt by a court of law;
(e)
the costs of recovering the debt exceeds the debt itself; or (1) efforts to collect the debt are abandoned for another reasonable cause.
3.
A bad debt shall be a deductible expense only if it is wholly and exclusively incurred in the normal course of business.”






97.
In addition, Section 15(2)(a) of the ITA provides as follows regarding deduction of bad debt in the process of ascertainment of the total income of a person.
“
(2)
Without prejudice to sub-section (1) of this section, in computing for a year of income the gains or profits chargeable to tax under section 3(2)(a) of this Act, the following amounts shall be deducted:
(a)
bad debts incurred in the production of such gains or profits which the Commissioner considers to have become bad, and doubtful debts so incurred to the extent that they are estimated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have become bad, during such year of income and the Commissioner may prescribe such guidelines as may be appropriate for the purposes of determining bad debts under this subparagraph;”






98.
It was not in dispute that Nakumatt Holdings Limited had been placed under an administrator by the High Court. The Respondent’s argument was that the Appellant’s debt did not meet the threshold of 
Legal Notice 37 of 2011
.






99.
The Tribunal notes that in support of its arguments to the effect that the debts owed to it by NHL were bad or doubtful, the Appellant attached a claim it lodged with the administrator demanding for payment of the outstanding amounts and the Court ruling based on which NHL was adjudged insolvent. The Appellant provided an explanation to confirm that it was an unsecured creditor.






100.
Further the Tribunal takes note of the High Court Ruling in Insolvency Cause No. 10 of 2017 dated 11
th
 March, 2021 where the Court while adopting the administrator’s report ruled as follows;
“
In this regard, I am satisfied that this is a fit case to disapply sub-section 1 of section 600 of the Act. Further, I disapply section 600(6) of the Act. The Administration Order is hereby extended to enable the Administrator to carry out the matters set out in his Report. The Court therefore adopts the Report of the Administrator.”






101.
Section 600 of the 
Insolvency Act
 states as follows as regards cases where a company under a Court Administrator has no property to meet its obligation to creditors;
“
(1)
On forming the belief that a company that is under administration has no property that might allow a distribution to its creditors, the administrator shall lodge with the Registrar a notice to that effect.
(2)
On the application of the administrator of a company, the Court may disapply subsection (1) in respect of the company.”






102.
It was not in dispute that the Appellant was an unsecured creditor to Nakumatt Holdings Limited. In consideration of the above Ruling of the Court, the Tribunal was persuaded that the Appellant’s situation as a Nakumatt creditor had satisfied the condition as set out under Clause 2(b) of the 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
 namely; No form of security or collateral is realisable whether partially or in full.






103.
The Tribunal further reiterates the holding in the case of Equity Bank Limited vs. Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Tax Appeal No. 161 of 2017 where the learned judge stated that;
“
Having considered the facts, I have outlined, the arguments by the parties and the reasons proffered by the Tribunal, I cannot say that the conclusions reached by the Tribunal are unreasonable. As I stated earlier, the Guidelines do not require that Equity exhaust all the avenues for collecting the debt. It only needs to satisfy one or more of the Guidelines in order to satisfy the Commissioner. In the circumstances, I do not find any reason to interfere with the Tribunal’s decision in each instance as the conclusions reached were within the law.” (emphasis added)






104.
Going by the foregoing analysis and the position as held by the court in the case of Equity Bank Limited vs. Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [2021] eKLR, it follows that the Appellant only needed to satisfy one or more of the conditions set out in Clause 2 of the 
Legal Notice No. 37 of 2011
.






105.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was not justified in its decision to disallow the Appellant’s claim for bad debts against its supplies to Nakumatt Holdings Limited and in the subsequent tax assessment.










VAT - Production analysis


106.
In its earlier review, in the foregoing paragraphs, on production analysis resulting in a Corporate tax assessment, the Tribunal found that the Respondent did not dispel the Appellant’s prima facie case that its production process, stock adjustments and subsequent losses were supported.






107.
The Tribunal notes that the same argument was used by the Respondent to raise VAT on expected sales as opposed to actual sales.






108.
As a result of the finding that the Respondent did not rebut the Appellant’s case, neither did it provide evidence to prove and justify its decision, the Tribunal similarly holds that the VAT assessment, based on the same arguments, similarly fails as it was not justified.








Final Decision


109.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is merited and consequently the Tribunal proceeds to make the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
b.
The Respondent’s Objection decision dated 31
st
 March, 2023 be and is hereby set aside.
c.
Each Party to bear its own costs.






110.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










Background


1.
The Appellant is a limited liability Company duly incorporated in Kenya under the 
Companies Act
. Its main business is actively tendering for contracts.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, Cap 469 laws of Kenya. The Kenya Revenue Authority (“KRA”) is an agency of the Government of Kenya for assessing, collecting, and accounting for all revenue.






3.
The Respondent conducted a review on the Appellant’s returns and found that the Appellant had under-declared income in both its VAT and income tax for the 
period of 2017
 to 2021.






4.
On 4
th
 January 2023, the Respondent issued the Appellant with a demand notice totaling Kshs 7,148,352.00 including penalties and interest for Income tax, PAYE, and Withholding tax.






5.
The Appellant lodged an objection application vide a letter dated 6
th
 March 2023 and provided documents to support the objection.






6.
The Respondent rendered its Objection decision on 25
th
 April 2023 fully rejecting the Appellant’s Objection and confirming the assessment for VAT and Income tax of Kshs. 6,918,538.09.






7.
Dissatisfied with the Objection decision, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 23
rd
 May 2023.








The Appeal


8.
The Appeal is premised on the following grounds listed in the Memorandum of Appeal dated 31
st
 May 2023 and filed on 5
th
 June 2023:-
a.
That the Commissioner erred in fact and in law by overstating the Respondent’s revenue for the years 2017 to 2021 based on erroneous summation of the total bank credits.
b.
That the Commissioner erred in fact and in law by charging Corporation tax and VAT on bank credits relating to non-revenue bankings.
c.
That the Commissioner acted in bad faith by disregarding other non -revenue banking such as contra entries (inter-bank transactions), reversals, director’s injections and loans from friends.








Appellant’s Case


9.
The Appellant’s case was premised on its Statement of Facts dated 31
st
 May 2023 and filed on 5
th
 June 2023.






10.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent analyzed all the bank statements availed by the Appellant and asserted that all the credits from the bank statements were business revenues.






11.
That the Respondent then compared the total bank credits vis a vis the total sales declared by the Appellant for the periods under review and claimed that the variances were sales that were not declared in the Corporation returns and subjected the variance to Corporation tax.






12.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent, in his assessment erroneously compared the total credited amounts in the bank statements vis-a-vis the total sales declared, without adjusting for the non-revenue banking's which included interbank transfers, reversals and loans from friends.






13.
The Appellant averred that it was grossly inaccurate for the Respondent to conclude that all the money in on the bank statements were business income. The Appellant provided the Respondent with a gross banking analysis and the bank statements to support the non-revenue deposits from the bank statements.






14.
The Appellant averred that the accurate amount to be considered as sales derived from the bank statements is as below:

14,762.52

15.
The Appellant contended that similarly to income tax, the Respondent computed VAT in the assumption that all the money in from the bank statements were business income and treated the variance as undeclared sales.






16.
The Appellant contented that the Respondent subjected the variance obtained from the comparison of the purported sales derived from the bank statements and sales declared in the VAT returns for the period 2017 to 2021 as undeclared sales and subjected them to VAT.






17.
The Appellant averred that it availed the gross banking analysis to the Respondent distinguishing the revenue income from the non-revenue income from the bank statements.






18.
The Appellant stated that it explained to the Respondent that the variance between the VAT sales and the Corporate tax sales was as a result of exempt sales that were erroneously not included in the VAT returns and that were to be amended to reflect the correct position.






19.
The Appellant contended that the Respondent, vide its Objection decision claimed that the Appellant did not provide the supporting documents to ascertain the variance was as a result of the exempt sales that were not declared in the VAT returns.






20.
The Appellant averred that it furnished the Respondent with all the local purchase orders that indicated that the supplies made to Mandera County were exempt sales and which were erroneously not declared in the VAT returns.






21.
The Appellant submitted that it did not have any undeclared revenue and therefore no outstanding taxes on account of income tax and VAT obligations. That the assessments amounting to Kshs. 6,918,538.09 for both VAT and Income tax should be amended to Nil as that is the correct position of the Appellant.








Appellant’s prayers.


22.
The Appellant prayed for orders that:
a.
This Appeal be allowed and the Respondent's Objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023 be set aside;
b.
The assessment of Kshs. 6,918,538.09 be expunged in totality.








Respondent’s Case


23.
The Respondent’s case is premised on its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 26
th
 June 2023.






24.
The Respondent stated that it requested for documents from the Appellant to support its objection on diverse dates between 13
th
 March 2023 and 23
rd
 March 2023, upon production of which, the Respondent issued an Objection decision on 25
th
 April 2023.






25.
The Respondent contended that following Section 31(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, the Respondent issued an assessment and tax demand for VAT and Corporation income tax resulting from under-declaration of income for both VAT and Income tax, over claimed purchases and missing PAYE tax obligation.






26.
The Respondent submitted that it is allowed to amend an assessment pursuant to Section 31(1) of the 
Tax procedures Act
 2015, using information available to it, and to the best of its judgment. Section 31(1) provides:
“


31.

(a)
Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the ""original assessment"") by making alterations or additions from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner’s judgement, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period.""

29.
The Respondent averred that the Appellant in its objection dated 6
th
 March 2023 only objected to the income tax, VAT and PAYE assessment amounts, but did not object to the WHT assessment of Kshs. 175,793 which was raised in the assessment dated 4
th
 January 2023. The Appellant only objected to the VAT and income tax assessment.






30.
The Respondent averred that the Appellant objected to the assessments on the following grounds;
a.
The Respondent based its assessments on the total bankings without due regard to interbank transfers, loans from friends and reversals.
b.
The Respondent charged the variance between the Appellant's declaration and the banking analysis as per the Respondent's letter of review of returns assessment and tax demands. The Appellant stated that it noted that it was the income from the interbank transfers loans and loan from friends that was not declared and the costs associated with it not claimed in the returns.
c.
The variances between the bankings and VAT is as a result of the exempt project. These were not included in the VAT returns as would have been the case.
d.
The director did not earn a salary from the company thus it cannot be estimated and charged for PAYE.






31.
The Respondent contended that it is empowered under Sections 58 and 59 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to require the production of documents and information to enable it ascertain tax liability of a person.






32.
That pursuant to Section 59(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 2015, the Respondent requested for documentation from the Appellant to support its objection. Section 59(1) provides;
“
59 Production of records
(1)
For the purposes of obtaining full information in respect of the tax liability of any person or class of persons, or for any other purposes
(2)
relating to a tax law, the Commissioner or an authorised officer may require any person, by notice in writing to-
(a)
produce for examination, at such time and place as may be specified in the notice, any documents (including in electronic format) that are in the person's custody or under the person's control relating to the tax liability of any person;
(b)
furnish information relating to the tax liability of any person in the manner and by the time as specified in the notice; or
(c)
attend, at the time and place specified in the notice, for the purpose of giving evidence in respect of any matter or transaction appearing to be relevant to the tax liability of any person.""






33.
The Respondent averred that it requested the Appellant on diverse dates between 13
th
 March 2023 and 23
rd
 March 2023, to provide requisite documents supporting its grounds of objection.






34.
The Respondent submitted that it relied on Section 51(3) of the 
Tax procedures Act
 2015 on production of documents, which stipulates that a validly lodged objection should be accompanied by supporting documentation. Section 51(3) states:
“
(3)A notice of objection shall be treated as validly lodged by a taxpayer under subsection (2) if-
(a)
the notice of objection states precisely the grounds of objection, the amendments required to be made to correct the decision, and the reasons for the amendments;
(b)
in relation to an objection to an assessment, the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of tax due under the assessment that is not in dispute or has applied for an extension of time to pay the tax not in dispute under section 33(1); and
(c)
all the relevant documents relating to the objection have been submitted.""






35.
That upon review of the document's produced by the Appellant, and its tax returns for the year January 2017 to December 2021, the Respondent established that on income tax the Respondent noted that the income declared for the years 2017 to 2020 was underdeclared. That this led to the Respondent confirming its additional assessment for underdeclared income.






36.
That Section 15 of the 
Income Tax Act
 provides for allowable expenses against any income earned. Section 15(1) of the 
Income Tax Act
 provides;
“


15.
Deductions allowed
(1)
For the purpose of ascertaining the total income of any person for a year of income there shall, subject to section 16 of this Act, be deducted all expenditure incurred in such year of income which is expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred by him in the production of that income, and where under section 27 of this Act any income of an accounting period ending on some day other than the last day of such year of income is, for the purpose of ascertaining total income for any year of income, taken to be income for any year of income, then such expenditure incurred during such period shall be treated as having been incurred during such year of income.”








37.
The Respondent averred that it also noted that the Appellant claimed for entertainment expenses amounting to Kshs. 3,548,005.00. The Appellant did not provide any documents to prove that such expenses were incurred.






38.
The Respondent posited that the burden of proving that expenses were incurred lies with the person claiming the expenses. The Appellant failed to discharge its burden of proof hence the Respondent disallowed the entertainment expenses claimed by the Appellant.






39.
That Respondent submitted that the findings on VAT was that the sales, as declared by the Appellant in its VAT returns, were grossly understated, leading to the additional assessment for a VAT tax liability of Kshs. 5,489,169.00 inclusive of interest and penalties, for the years 2017 to 2021.






40.
The Respondent averred that the documents produced by the Appellant were unsatisfactory in supporting its objection against the additional VAT assessment, once again failing to discharge its burden of proving that the Respondent’s assessment was erroneous.






41.
That on findings on P.A.Y.E the Respondent, through banking analysis and a review of the documents provided by the Appellant, established that the director of the Appellant company received an income from which arose a P.A.Y.E obligation which the Appellant did not declare. The Respondent, based on the information available to it and its best judgment, estimated the director’s salary at Kshs. 50,000.00 per month for the years 2019 to 2021 and raised an assessment for P.A.Y.E obligation at Kshs. 826,200.00, inclusive of interest and penalties.






42.
The Respondent submitted that the Appellant ought to have produced its accounting records as evidence to show that the director did not receive any renumeration that would be considered a monthly salary or income from the company. The Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof in relation to this ground of assessment, which the Respondent confirmed in its objection decision.






43.
On WHT findings, the Respondent also established that the company procured Legal services in the years 2019 to 2021, for which WHT relating to the services was not accounted for in the Appellant’s returns. That although this tax assessment was raised in the assessment dated 4
th
 January 2023, the Appellant did not object to the same.






44.
The Respondent averred that it proceeded to use the documents produced by the Appellant, and its banking analysis to review the Appellant’s objection.






45.
The Respondent submitted that it rejected the Appellant's objection based on the evidence that was available to it, due to the Appellant's failure to provide satisfactory evidence, and to the best of the Commissioners knowledge.






46.
The Respondent stated that the Appellant bears the burden of proof as provided under Section 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 which provides thus:
“
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.”






47.
The Respondent relied on Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, 2015 which provides that the burden of proving that the tax assessment is wrong lies with the Appellant. Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 states;
“
In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.""






48.
The Respondent averred that it reasonably believed that it accorded the Appellant herein a chance to prove that its assessment was erroneous, by requesting for documentation from the Appellant. The Appellant produced evidence which was unsatisfactory in supporting its objection.






49.
The Respondent posited that the Appellant failed to satisfactorily support its objection, and in turn failed to discharge its burden of proof in demonstrating that the Respondent’s assessments were erroneous.






50.
The Respondent averred that its objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023, wherein it confirmed its assessments for income tax and VAT as proper in law.








Respondent’s prayers.


51.
The Respondent prayed for the Tribunal to:
a.
Uphold the Respondent’s Objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023 requiring payment for VAT and Income tax of Kshs. 6,918,538.09.
b.
Dismiss this Appeal with costs to the Respondent as the same is without merit.








Issue For Determination


52.
The Tribunal having evaluated the pleadings and submissions of the parties is of the view that there is one issue that calls for its determination;
Whether the Respondent’s Objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023 was proper in law.








Analysis And Findings


53.
The Tribunal having determined the issues falling for its determination proceeds to analyse the same as hereunder.






54.
The Respondent posited that it issued an assessment and tax demand for VAT, and Corporation tax to the Appellant resulting from under-declaration of income for both VAT and Income tax from claimed purchases and missing PAYE obligations after an audit of the returns filed by the Appellant.






55.
It was the Respondent’s case that the Appellant objected to the additional assessments of Income tax, VAT, and PAYE on its KRA portal but did not object to the Withholding tax assessment which was raised in the assessment dated 4
th
 January 2023 of Kshs. 175,793.00 wherein it established that the company procured legal services in the years 2019 to 2021 in which Withholding tax was not accounted for in the Appellant’s returns.






56.
The Respondent reiterated that the Appellant failed to produce its accounting records as evidence that the director did not receive any remuneration in the form of a monthly salary or income from the company and the same was confirmed in the Objection decision.






57.
The Respondent maintained that the Applicant failed to satisfactorily prove the grounds of its Objection hence the confirmation of its assessments, fully rejecting the Appellant’s Objection stating that upon a review of the documents produced by the Appellant and its tax returns for the period January 2017 to December 2021, it established that the income declared for the years 2017 to 2020 was under declared and thus it confirmed its additional assessment for the under declared income.






58.
On the other hand, the Appellant averred that the Respondent erroneously compared the total credit amounts in the bank assessments vis a vis the total sales and declared without adjusting for non-revenue deposits from the bank statements and also computed VAT in the assumption that all the ‘money in’ from the bank statements were business income treating the variance obtained from the comparison of the purported sales derived from the bank statements and sales declared in the VAT returns for the period 2017 to 2021 as undeclared sales and subject to VAT.






59.
It is the Appellant’s case that the Respondent failed to distinguish the revenue income from the non-revenue income from the bank statements and explained to the Respondent that the variance between the VAT sales and the Corporate tax sales was a result of exempt sales that were erroneously not included in the VAT returns and that this was to be amended to reflect the correct position.






60.
The Tribunal observes that Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 provides as follows:-
“
(1)
Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment (referred to in this section as the “original assessment"") by making alterations or additions, from the available information and to the best of the Commissioner's judgment, to the original assessment of a taxpayer for a reporting period to ensure that— (a) in the case of a deficit carried forward under the 
Income Tax Act
 (Cap. 470), the taxpayer is assessed in respect of the correct amount of the deficit carried forward for the reporting period; (b) in the case of an excess amount of input tax under the 
Value Added Tax Act
, 2013 (No. 35 of 2013), the taxpayer is assessed in respect of the correct amount of the excess input tax carried forward for the reporting period; or (c) in any other case, the taxpayer is liable for the correct amount of tax payable in respect of the reporting period to which the original assessment relates.”






61.
The Tribunal has held before that exercise of best judgment includes use of bank deposit analysis in TAT Appeal No. 115 of TAT Appeal No. 115 of 2017 Digital Box Limited 2017 Vs Commissioner of Investigation & Enforcement where the Tribunal stated as follows: -
“
Further the courts have in the past held that the banking analysis test (also known as bank deposit analysis) is an acceptable method of arriving at an assessment. This was held to be so in the case of Bachmann v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 51 where the court stated that:-
""This court has recognized that in an appropriate case a bank deposit appropriate case a bank deposit analysis is an acceptable method to compute income."" Once it is established that the method is allowed, the question is whether the method was applied in arriving at a reasonable assessment in the case at hand. The Tribunal is guided by the test set out in CA McCourtie LON/92/191 where it was stated: - ""In addition to the conclusions drawn by Woolf Jin Van Boeckel earlier tribunal decisions identified three further propositions of relevance in determining whether an assessment is reasonable. These are, first that the facts should be objectively gathered and intelligently interpreted; secondly. that any calculations should be arithmetically sound; and finally, that any sampling technique should be representative and free from bias.”






62.
The Tribunal finds that the Appellant has not proven that the use of bank deposit analysis is against the law and that when the Respondent used it, that the Respondent arrived at an unreasonable assessment which lacked objectivity or was arithmetically wrong or biased.






63.
The Appellant maintained that it furnished the Respondent with all the local purchase orders indicating that the supplies made to Mandera County were exempt sales and were erroneously not declared in the VAT returns.






64.
Section 30 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 provides as follows with regard to burden of proof:-
“
the appellant has the burden of proving –
(a)
where an appeal relates to an assessment, that the assessment is excessive; or
(b)
in any other case, that the tax decision should not have been made or should have been made differently.”






65.
Section 56 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 further provides as thus:-
“
In any proceedings under this Part, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.”






66.
Section 62 of the VAT Act clearly states that the onus of proving that any goods or services are exempt from VAT lies with the taxpayer. The provision states that: -
“
In any civil proceedings under this Act, the burden of proving that any tax has been paid or that any goods or services are exempt from payment of tax shall lie on the person liable to pay the tax or claiming that the tax has been paid or that the goods or services are exempt from payment of tax.”






67.
The Tribunal observes that the Appellant, while it alleged to have made VAT exempt supplies to the County Government of Mandera, failed to discharge its burden of proving that the supply it made was exempt from VAT under the VAT Act, and/or failed to prove that a VAT exemption for the supplies to the County Government had been approved by the Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury in accordance with the Guidelines/Framework for Requesting, Processing And Granting Of Tax Exemption/Waiver/Variation/ Remission on a National Tax, A Fee Or A Charge, Treasury Circular No. 9/ 2018.






68.
Based on the foregoing, the Appellant, failed to persuade the Tribunal with competent evidence that the Respondent erred in assessing VAT on the Appellant’s supplies to the County Government of Mandera, and thus did not discharge its burden of proof under Section 62 of the VAT Act, Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, and Section 30 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
.






69.
The Tribunal is of the considered view that the Appellant has not adduced satisfactory evidence before this Tribunal to show that the Respondent’s Objection decision was incorrect and further, the Appellant has not addressed the Respondent’s assessment on the undeclared entertainment expenses, PAYE from its director’s salary and withholding tax from the legal services it procures.






70.
The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023 was proper in law.








Final Decision


71.
The upshot to the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal lacks merit and the Tribunal consequently makes the following Orders;-
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.
b.
The Respondent’s objection decision dated 25
th
 April 2023 be and is hereby upheld.
c.
Each part to bear its own costs.






72.
It is so ordered.

Kenya Revenue Authority Act
 (KRA), 
Act No. 2 of 1995
, and KRA is empowered to enforce and administer provisions of written laws set out in Section 5 as read together with the First Schedule of the KRA Act.






3.
The Respondent conducted an audit of the Appellant’s tax affairs for the period 2013 to 2017 following a tax refund application by the Appellant. The audit covered Corporation tax, Withholding tax, VAT and PAYE for the entire period.






4.
On 11
th
 July 2019. the Respondent communicated its findings, confirming that the Appellant had tax credits of Ksh. 451,108,038.00 with an outstanding liability of Kshs. 169,510,255.00 inclusive of principal and interest.






5.
On 15
th
 July 2022, the Respondent confirmed that the refund allowed amounted to Kshs. 448,671,485.00 excluding Kshs. 2,436,553.00 opening tax credits.






6.
The Appellant in a letter dated 7
th
 July 2023 requested the Respondent that its PAYE liability for the month of June 2023, amounting to Kshs 16,514,540.00, be offset against the tax refund due to it.






7.
The Respondent replied on 13
th
 July 2023, indicating that the Appellant’s claims were undergoing processing at the refunds Section and were yet to be approved hence the utilisation of the credits was not possible.






8.
The Appellant being aggrieved by the Respondent's refund decision lodged this Appeal at the Tribunal on 15
th
 August 2023.






9.
On 15
th
 February 2024, by consent of the parties, the Appellant was granted leave to file its Appeal out of time and thus its Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents were thereby deemed properly filed and served.






The Appeal


10.
The Appeal is premised on the following grounds as stated in the Appellant’s Memorandum of Appeal filed on 15
th
 August 2023:
a.
That the Commissioner erred and misdirected itself in fact and in law in declining to utilize overpaid taxes to offset the Appellant’s current and future tax liabilities.
b.
That the Commissioner erred and misdirected itself in law in failing to adhere to the provisions of Section 47 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. 2015.
c.
That in declining to utilize the Appellant's overpaid taxes to offset the Appellant's current and future tax liabilities, the Commissioner failed to take into account the fact that it had already undertaken an audit and consequently confirmed and ascertained the refunds due to the Appellant twice.
d.
That the Commissioner erred and misdirected itself in fact and law in declining to utilize the Appellant's overpaid taxes to offset the Appellant's tax liabilities based on reasons not founded on any law
e.
That the Respondent's decision is unjust and in breach of Article 47 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and of the Appellant's legitimate expectation.








Appellant’s Case


11.
The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents before the Tribunal: -
a.
Its Statement of Facts filed on 15
th
 August 2023.
b.
Its Written Submissions dated 26
th
 March 2024 and filed on 28
th
 March 2024






12.
The Appellant averred that even after confirming the refund amount to which it was entitled, the Respondent failed to process payment since 2019, prompting the Appellant to follow up on the same in 2022 when the Respondent confirmed once again the amount due to the Appellant in its letter dated 15
th
 July 2022






13.
That on 25
th
 August 2022, the Appellant applied for waiver on interest and penalties amounting to Kshs. 42,252,512.00 indicated in the audit findings or 11
th
 July 2019 and 15
th
 July 2022 as the non-payment of taxes was neither deliberate nor by wilful omission or commission and that none of the penalties arose under Section 85 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. That its application did not elicit any response from the Respondent.






14.
The Appellant averred that on 16
th
 December 2022 it communicated with the Respondent confirming that it was in agreement with the Commissioner's findings on the tax refunds for the period 2013 to 2017 as communicated in the letter dated 15
th
 July 2022.






15.
The Appellant averred that it sought an offset of its refunds, which had already been ascertained and approved under Section 47 (l) (a) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
. That the overpaid taxes were not in dispute as the same had been confirmed by the Respondent in its letter dated 11
th
 July 2019.






16.
The Appellant averred that it made its application for refund under Section 47 of the TPA, which provides;
1.
Where a taxpayer has overpaid a tax under any tax law, the taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, in the prescribed form—
a
to offset the overpaid tax against the taxpayer's outstanding tax debts and future tax liabilities; or
b
for a refund of the overpaid tax within five years, or six months in the case of value added tax, after the date on which the tax was overpaid.
2.
The Commissioner shall ascertain and determine an application under subsection (1) within ninety days and where the Commissioner ascertains that there was an overpayment of tax—
a.
in the case of an application under subsection (1) (a), apply the overpaid tax to such outstanding tax debts or future tax liability; and
b.
in the case of an application under subsection (1)(b), refund the overpaid tax within a period of six months from the date of ascertainment and, if the Commissioner fails to refund, the overpaid tax shall be applied to offset the taxpayer’s outstanding tax debt or future tax liabilities.”






17.
The Appellant averred that in an email dated 7
th
 March 2023. the Respondent indicated that the confirmation of the refund amount was pending approval of the refund on the iTax system through the issuance of a system-generated receipt.






18.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent blatantly disregarded the fact that it had ascertained and approved the refund amounts in 2019 close to four (4) years before the email of 7
th
 March 2023 which indicated that the same was still pending approval.






19.
The Appellant submitted that there was no cogent or justifiable reason for declining to offset the ascertained amounts against the Appellant's tax liabilities.






20.
The Appellant relied on the case of Tata Chemicals Magadi Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes (large Taxpayers) [2014] eKLR where the court stated:
“
....The taxpayer who carries on his business in accordance with the law and applies for a refund is entitled to the refund as a matter of rights. The process of verification and processing the claim must, in the words of Article 47 (1) of 
the Constitution
, be efficient and expeditious.”






21.
The Appellant further relied on the case of Kenya Data Networks Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority [2013) eKLR; where the Court stated the following:
“
43. The respondent had a duty to act on the Petitioner’s VAT refunds timeously. While recognising that it is mandated by statute to collect taxes. and while appreciating the pivotal role that collection of taxes plays in a country's economic development and provision of services for citizens. KRA must also always be cognizant of the possible ramifications of illegal action or omissions In dealing with taxpayers, and the impact on investment. revenue collection and the general welfare of the country. While there is no statutory period within which KRA ought to make good tax refund claims. it cannot have any basis for failing to process tax refund claims for several months and, in some cases, several years after they were made. There is no answer to the petitioner's claim for a tax refund for the respondent to demand, in turn, that the petitioner pays arrears of tax. Further. the petitioner is correct when it argues that it is unreasonable for the respondent to withhold tax refunds which are much higher than the amount allegedly due for tax arrears and erroneous tax refunds. I therefore find and hold that the failure by the respondent to consider the petitioner’s application for a refund is a breach of the petitioner’s right to fair administrative action under Article 47(1).”






22.
The Appellant averred that the letters by the Respondent dated 11
th
 July 2019 and 15
th
 July 2022 confirmed that the refund amounts were due to the Appellant and that the Respondent ought to have processed the same expeditiously and timeously.






23.
The Appellant submitted that its applications for tax refund were made contemporaneously with filing its returns from 2015 to 2019 based on its tax credits at the time.






24.
The Appellant averred that the objection acknowledgment receipt was dated 22
nd
 December 2021, which means that by virtue of Section 51 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, the objection process ought to have been concluded with the issuance of an objection decision within sixty days, that is, by 20
th
 February 2022. That, therefore, the Respondent cannot purport to use the objection as a reason for failing to apply the Appellant's refunds ascertained in 2019 to offset its liabilities.






25.
The Appellant submitted that the Respondent produced a refund rejection order issued on 25
th
 May 2023, yet the order related to a refund application made on 29
th
 September 2017, being part of the refund applications that were subjected to audit, and the amount due to the Appellant ascertained.






26.
The Appellant submitted that Article 47 of 
the Constitution
 provides that:
“
every person has the right to fair administrative action that is expeditious. efficient. lawful. reasonable. and procedurally fair.”






27.
The Appellant relied on the case of Republic v Kenya Revenue Authority Ex-parte L.A.B. International Kenya Limited [2011] eKLR wherein the High Court stated the following:-
“
In relation to KRA's obligation when dealing with applications for tax refunds:


The common law. in its evolution. has defined the rules of conduct for a public authority making a public decision. entrusting the overall control jurisdiction to the hands of the courts of law but for Kenya. such a general competence of the Courts is now no longer confined to the terms of statute law and subsidiary legislation. but has a fresh underwriting in 
the Constitution
 of Kenya. 2010. Article 47. imposes a duty of fair administrative action. and [Art. 10(2) (c)j demands ''good governance. integrity. transparency and accountability"".


From the facts of the instant case. it is dear to this Court that the respondent failed to deal with the applicant's claim for a VAT refund in the context of (fairness and transparency. accountability or good governance"".








28.
The Appellant submitted that it had a legitimate expectation that the Respondent having ascertained and approved its refund claims would proceed to offset them in accordance with Section 47 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.








Appellant’s Prayers


29.
The Appellant prayed that the Tribunal finds:
i.
That the Appeal be and is hereby allowed.
ii.
That the Respondent's decision dated 13
th
 July 2023 be and is hereby set aside.
iii.
That the Respondent be and is hereby directed to utilize the Appellant's confirmed and ascertained tax overpayments to offset the Appellant's current and future tax liabilities.
iv.
That the Respondent be and is hereby restrained from demanding any taxes from the Appellant for as long as the Appellant has not exhausted its ascertained and confirmed tax overpayments, which can be utilized to offset its current and future tax liabilities.
v.
That the costs of the Appeal be awarded to the Appellant.
vi.
Any other or further remedies that the Tribunal deems just and reasonable.








Respondent’s Case


30.
The Respondent’s case is premised on the hereunder filed documents: -
i.
The Respondent’s Statement of Facts dated 28th September 2023 and filed on even date.
ii.
The Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 3
rd
 April 2024 and filed on 4
th
 April 2024.






31.
The Respondent raised a preliminary objection to the Appeal on the ground that the Appellant had filed two matters relating to the same issues, that is TAT No. 492 of 2023 and TAT No. 479 of 2023. The Respondent posited that as a result the instant Notice of Appeal dated 14
th
 August 2023 was fatally defective as it was contrary to the Res judicata rule.






32.
The Respondent relied on the case of Mohamed Dado Hatu Vs. Dhadho Gaodae Godhana 2 Others [2017] eKLR where the High Court observed as follows concerning the doctrine of res judicata:-
“
…. The doctrine of res judicata has well been upheld to bar parties from ligating in bits running from one forum litigating and seeking the same remedy while giving their disputes a cosmetic uplifting. This position was acknowledged by the court in the case of 
HENRY WANYAMA KHAEMBA Vs STANDARD CHARTERED BANK OF KENYA LIMITES, Civil case 560 of 2006
, where it stated thus; The doctrine of re judicata prohibits parties by suing in bits and pieces or giving a subsequent case legal fees lifting by removing parties who are part of the earlier and/or filed and determined… I accept the submissions by counsel for the defendants that the doctrine of res judicata would only apply to situations where a specific matter between the same persons litigating in the same capacity has previously been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction but also to situations where either matters could have been brought in were not brought in or parties who could have been enjoined were not enjoined. Parties cannot evade the doctrine of res judicata by merely adding other parties or causes of action in a subsequent suit. They are bound into bring all their cases at once. They are forbidden from litigation in instalments.”






33.
The Respondent submitted further that the Appeal herein was premature since the Appellant was clearly informed that the two claims were being processed at the refunds section and were yet to be approved and that utilisation would be done once the claims are processed and approved through the I-Tax system.






34.
The Respondent submitted that the delay was occasioned by material disclosures by the Appellant, which necessitated further audit. That thus, lodging an objection by the Appellant led to the reopening of the audit process.






35.
Relying on Section 47 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, the Respondent averred that some of the refunds sought fell outside the stipulated five years.






36.
The Respondent averred that it was acting in good faith and that it had undertaken to complete the authentication process in the shortest time possible and inform the Appellant of the ascertained refunds, which the Appellant would thereafter utilise as provided in law.








Respondent’s Prayers


37.
The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal finds:
a.
Upholds the Respondent's Preliminary Objection.
b.
Dismisses this Appeal with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid of merit.








Issues And Determination


38.
The Tribunal having considered the parties pleadings and submissions was of the view that the issues that fall for its determination are:
i.
Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal
ii.
Whether the Respondent erred by failing to offset tax credits against the Appellant’s tax liabilities








Analysis And Findings


39.
Having identified the issues that fell for its determination, the Tribunal proceeded to analyse them as here under.
a.
Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal






40.
The Respondent raised a Preliminary Objection on the grounds that;
i.
The Appeal was filed out of time without leave of the Tribunal
ii.
That the Appeal herein offends the principle of Res judicata since there was another Appeal before the Tribunal for a similar period filed as TAT No. E492 of 2023.






41.
On whether the Appeal was filed out of time without leave of the Tribunal, the Tribunal notes that on 15
th
 February 2024, by consent of the parties the Appellant was granted leave to file its Appeal out of time thereby its Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents were deemed as properly filed and served.






42.
On the Respondent’s contention that there were two matters before the Tribunal on the same issues, the Appellant countered that Appeal No TAT E479 of 2023 was an Appeal against the refund decision dated 13
th
 July 2023 relating to an offset of PAYE liability for the month of June 2023 while Appeal No. E492 of 2023 was an Appeal against the Respondent’s refund decision dated 21
st
 July 2023 relating to an offset of VAT liability for the month of June 2023.






43.
The Tribunal’s evaluation of the Notices of Appeal filed by the Appellant in TAT No E479 of 2023 and TAT No E492 of 2023 ascertained that Appeals are founded on two different decisions of the Commissioner each concerning a different tax head. Appeal No E479 of 2023 is an Appeal against the refund decision dated 13
th
 July 2023 relating to P.A.Y.E offset claim for the month of June 2023 while Appeal No E492 of 2023 is an Appeal against the refund decision dated 21
st
 July 2023 relating to VAT offset claim for the month of June 2023.






44.
The Respondent’s submission that this Appeal offends the doctrine of res judicata is therefore unfounded as the matter in dispute in this Appeal has not been determined by the Tribunal. As it were, the two Appeals being distinct causes of action merit for separate determination.






45.
Having dispensed of with the Respondent’s grounds for preliminary objection, the Tribunal undertook to ascertain the nature of the dispute that was before it for determination.






46.
Section 3 of the TPA defines an Appealable decision as:
“
appealable decision” means an objection decision and any other decision made under a tax law other than—
a.
a tax decision; or
b.
a decision made in the course of making a tax decision;






47.
The Tribunal observed that the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal was founded on the Respondent’s letter of 13
th
 July 2023 wherein the Respondent responded to the Appellant’s application for utilisation of overpaid taxes to offset tax liabilities, the response read in part that:
“
Kindly note that the two claims are currently undergoing processing at refunds section and are yet to be approved. Two cases are pending at LTO Audit Section. Utilisation will be done once the claims are processed and approved through the iTax system.”






48.
It is the Tribunal’s considered view that the Respondent’s letter of 13
th
 July 2023 was an administrative correspondence informing the Appellant of the status of its application for tax offset. As such, the impugned letter does not fall within the definition of an appealable decision.






49.
Whereas the Tribunal notes the Appellant’s frustration with the Respondent’s delay in determining its various applications for utilisation of overpaid taxes as provided for under Section 47 (2)(1) (a)(b) of the TPA, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to determination of appealable decisions. Relief for a taxpayer who is aggrieved by the Respondent’s administrative processes is to be found elsewhere.






50.
The Tribunal is guided by its decision in Atta Kenya Limited
 Vs Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Tat Misc. Appl. No. 6 Of 2018
 Ruling [2020] eKLR wherein it stated that:
“
We therefore note that there are clear provisions of law in the TPA that provide for mechanisms to be exhausted before a matter is moved to the Tribunal. The Applicant failed to file an objection to the Respondent's demands and instead approached this Honorable Tribunal for an extension of time to appeal out of time when there was no appealable decision. Under the TPA an ""Appealable Decision means an objection decision and any other decision made under a tax law other than (a) a tax decision: or (b) a decision in the course of making a tax decision”.
Having made a determination that the Application before us is premature on the basis that the Applicant has not exhausted the internal mechanisms set down by the law before making an application to file an appeal out of time we will not belabour as to whether the Applicant has satisfied us as to the reasons for not filing the appeal on time.
Consequently. we find that the application is unmerited and make the following orders: -
The Notice of Motion dated 17th May 2019 and filed on even date is hereby dismissed.”






51.
The Tribunal therefore finds that the Appeal herein is invalid as the same is not founded on an appealable decision.
b.
Whether the Respondent erred by failing to offset tax credits against the Appellant’s tax liabilities






52.
The Tribunal having found that this Appeal is invalid did not delve into this issue for determination as it had been rendered moot.








Final Decision


53.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal is incompetent and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders: -
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.
b.
Each party to bear its own costs.






54.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The Appellant vide a Notice of Motion application dated the 18
th
 day of June, 2024 and filed on the 20
th
 June, 2024 and which was supported by an Affidavit sworn by the Appellant himself, sought for the following Orders:-
a.
Spent
b.
That the Honourable Tribunal be pleased to extend the time allowed for the Appellant to file a Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal, Statement of Facts and all other supporting documents.
c.
That the Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal, Statement of Facts dated 18
th
 June, filed herewith be deemed as properly filed and served.
d.
That costs of this application be provided for.






2.
The application is premised on the following grounds:-
a.
That the Respondent issued the Appellant with Income tax-rent income assessment for the period 1
st
 August, 2018 for Kshs 415,000.00.
b.
That the Appellant objected to the said assessment on 3
rd
 March, 2021.
c.
That the Respondent subsequently issued the Appellant with an objection decision dated 10
th
 November, 2021 invalidating the Appellant’s objection fully.
d.
That the Respondent issued the Appellant with a confirmation of assessment notice dated 17
th
 November, 2021 confirming its objection decision.
e.
That the Appellant was indisposed having been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the year 2021 and has been unwell todate rendering him unable to attend to any business.
f.
That the Appellant has an arguable Appeal with high probability.
g.
That the Appellant stands to suffer irreparable loss and damage if the orders sought are not granted as the Respondent may proceed to enforce an erroneous assessment.






3.
The Respondent in opposition to the application filed a Replying Affidavit that was sworn by Kiteme Itonge, an officer of the Respondent, on the 4
th
 day of July, 2024 and filed on the even date, in which it stated as follows:-
a.
That on about August, 2018 the Respondent issued Income Tax-Rent Income assessment for the period 1
st
 August, 2018 through an Assessment Order dated 29
th
 July, 2020.
b.
That the Appellant objected to the assessment on itax vide an objection application dated 3
rd
 March, 2021.
c.
That the objection being unsupported the Respondent issued an objection fully on the 10
th
 November, 2021.
d.
That the Respondent confirmed its assessment vide a confirmation of assessment dated 17
th
 November, 2021.
e.
That the Appellant if dissatisfied with the Respondent’s decision of 10
th
 November, 2021 ought in pursuant to Section 13(1) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 to have preferred an appeal on or before 10
th
 December, 2021.
f.
That the Appellant did not lodge any appeal to the Respondent’s decision in time and only filed the Notice of Appeal on 18
th
 June, 2024, which was 2 years and 6 months and 8 days after the objection decision was issued.
g.
That upon expiry of the statutory period of preferring an appeal against the Respondent’s decision, the taxes assessed against the Appellant became due by operation of law and the Respondent was at liberty to enforce payment of the same.
h.
That the Appellant’s failure to lodge an appeal against the Respondent’s objection decision is not a mere technicality that can be cured under Article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 but a deliberate omission that runs on the face of clear statutory provisions.
i.
That the delay is inordinate and the stated ground of sickness has not been demonstrated and sufficiently justified.
j.
That the application has been brought in bad faith and is an attempt to further delay the collection of taxes due and payable by the Appellant.
k.
That the application lacks merit and is incompetent.
l.
That the application is an afterthought that has not been substantiated and the medical chit from Ramani Medical Centre alone is not sufficient to explain the history of treatment over the years from 2021 todate that the Appellant claims he was undergoing treatment.
m.
That extension of time is not a right of a party but rather an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the Tribunal.
n.
That statutory timelines give rise to substantive rights and obligations and thus the Respondent will be prejudiced by extension of time, as it will not be in a position to collect taxes, which have crystallized.
o.
That the spirit of Section 3(4) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 was not to give way to abuse of the process but rather allow the interests of justice to prevail and in so doing, there must be balance of justice to the extent that the Section should not be used to the advantage of one party to prejudice the other.






Analysis and Findings


4.
The parties in compliance with the directions of the Tribunal to the effect that the application was to be canvassed by way of written submissions duly filed their respective submissions that were adopted by the Tribunal on the 27
th
 June, 2024. The Tribunal has considered and has been appropriately guided by the purport of the submissions and the authorities cited therein in arriving at its findings hereinafter.






5.
The Tribunal’s jurisdiction for the enlargement of time in the commencement of an appeal process is found under Section 13(2) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 which provides as thus:-
“
(3)
The Tribunal may, upon application in writing, extend the time for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).
(4)
An extension under subsection (3) may be granted owing to absence from Kenya, or sickness, or other reasonable cause that may have prevented the applicant from giving notice of appeal within the specified period.”






6.
The Tribunal is enjoined to determine the length and reason for the delay when considering an application for the extension of time to appeal out of time. The power to extend is discretionary and unfettered but the same must be exercised judiciously.






7.
In determining whether to extend time, the Tribunal is guided by the court in Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR, where the learned Judge quoted Sir Thomas Bingham M R in Costellow V Somerset County Council (1993)1 All ER 952 where he stated that:-
“
The first principle is that the rules of court and the associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote expeditious dispatch of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of a procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate…. Further, an extension of time is an indulgence from the court by a party in default. He is not entitled to an extension. He has no reasonable or legitimate expectation of receiving one. His only reasonable or legitimate expectation is that the discretion relevant to his application to extend time will be exercised judicially in accordance with established principles of what is fair and reasonable. In those circumstances, it is incumbent on the applicant for an extension of time to provide the court with a full, honest and acceptable explanation of the reasons for the delay. He cannot reasonably expect the discretion to be exercised in his favour, as a defaulter, unless he provides an explanation for the default.”






8.
On the criteria of the issues to be considered when granting an extension to file an appeal out of time, the Tribunal referred to the case of Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591 where the Court laid a hierarchy of factors to consider when it stated that:-
“
an applicant must now show, in descending scale of importance, the following factors: -
a)
That there is merit in his appeal.
b)
That the extension of time to institute and/or file the appeal will not cause undue prejudice to the respondent; and
c)
That the delay has not been inordinate.”






9.
The Tribunal, guided by the principles set out in Wasike V Swala [1984] KLR 591, Joseph Ondiek Tumbo v Sony Sugar Co Ltd [2014] eKLR and Section 13 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
, 2013 used the following criteria to consider the application.
a.
Whether the appeal is merited.
b.
Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay.
c.
Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted.








a. Whether the Appeal is merited?


10.
The Tribunal examined whether the actions complained of by the Applicant were merited and whether there was an arguable appeal before the Tribunal or the appeal was frivolous to the extent that it would only result in a waste of the Tribunal’s time.






11.
An appeal being merited does not mean that it should necessarily succeed but rather it is arguable. The Tribunal was guided by the findings of the court in Kenya Commercial Bank Limited Vs Nicholas Ombija (2009) eKLR where it was held that:-
“
an arguable appeal is not one which must necessarily succeed, but one which ought to be argued fully before the court.”






12.
The Appellant simultaneously with the filing of this application filed a Memorandum of Appeal and the Statement of Facts which challenged the Respondent’s objection decision dated 10
th
 November, 2021.






13.
A perusal of both the Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts disclose some material legal and factual issues that call for an appropriate determination of the Appeal on its proper merits. To that extent the Appellant is deserving of an opportunity to canvass its Appeal before the Tribunal.








b. Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?


14.
In considering what constitutes as a reasonable reason for the delay, the court in Balwant Singh v Jagdish Singh & Ors (Civil Appeal No.1166 of 2006), held that:-
“
The test is whether or not a cause is sufficient to see whether it could have been avoided by the party by the exercise of due care and attention”.






15.
The Appellant contended that the reason it was delayed from lodging an appeal on time was due to long illness of anxiety and depression that has been attested to by the medical chit from the medical facility that the Appellant was severally attended to and managed.






16.
The Tribunal finds the explanation and reasons raised by the Appellant as the medical chit indicates that the Appellant medical state has improved and that could explain his subsequent taking action without prompting through any enforcement processes to recover taxes that had since crystallized for recovery.








c. Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted.


17.
The Respondent did not demonstrate to the Tribunal how it would suffer prejudice if the extension of time is granted.






18.
The Appellant's only hope for justice lies in an appeal to the Tribunal. Thus, the Appellant argued that it would suffer prejudice if it is not granted leave to file its appeal considering that the amount of money claimed is of a significant amount which would lead to failure by the Appellant to pay wages, taxes, and conduct business normally.






19.
The Tribunal is thus compelled to agree with the Appellant in its argument that the Respondent would otherwise still collect the taxes together with penalties and interest should the Appellant be found to be at fault. The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Respondent will not suffer prejudice if the extension is granted.






20.
The Appellant has in the circumstances met the statutory and judicially established threshold for the grant of application for the enlargement of time to file an appeal.








Disposition


33.
On the basis of the foregoing analysis the application is merited and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:-
a.
The application be and is hereby allowed.
b.
The Appellant be and is hereby granted leave to file an appeal out of time.
c.
The Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents filed on the 20
th
 June, 2024 be and are hereby deemed as duly filed and served.
d.
The Respondent to file and serve its Statement of Facts within Thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of this Ruling.
e.
No orders as to costs.

Ruling










1.
The Appellant vide a Notice of Motion dated the 13
th
 day of February, 2024 filed under a Certificate of urgency on the 20
th
 February, 2024 and which is supported by an Affidavit sworn by Karim Jeja, a Director of the Appellant, on the 13
th
 day of February, 2024 sought for the following Orders:-
a.
Spent
b.
That the Tribunal be pleased to grant the Appellant leave to file a Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts out of time.
c.
That the Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts filed herewith be deemed as duly filed with leave of this Honourable Tribunal.
d.
That the Appellant be granted costs of this application.






2.
The application is premised on the following grounds:-
a.
That the Respondent raised additional assessment for corporate tax in respect of the Appellant for the years 2013 to 2014.
b.
That these assessments came as a surprise to the Appellant considering that the Respondent had conducted a compliance check on the Appellant then trading as Pro-Dema Limited in 2015 and the resultant findings did not have any tax liability.
c.
That being dissatisfied with these assessment the Appellant filed a Notice of objection with the Respondent on 24
th
 April, 2019. That the Appellant was not notified of the outcome of the objection until January, 2020.
d.
That upon being served with the objection decision the Appellant realized that the same was dated 14
th
 October, 2019 which is over 5 months after the objection was filed.
e.
That upon perusal of the confirmation notices, the Appellant realized that no reasons were supplied in support of the Respondent’s decision to confirm the additional assessment and decline the Appellant’s objection in totality.
f.
That the Appellant’s agents wrote to the Respondent on diverse dates between 2020 and 2023 requesting for reasons in support of the Respondent’s objection decision supplied and the schedule of workings in line with the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of the 
Fair Administrative Action Act
.
g.
That despite the numerous requests for reasons in support of the objection decision, the Respondent has failed, declined or neglected to issue reasons in support of its objection decision to enable the Appellant timely appeal the same before this Honourable Tribunal.






3.
The Respondent upon being served with the application filed Grounds of Opposition to the application in which it stated as follows, that:-
a.
The application is incompetent, bad in law, fatally defective and is an abuse of this Honourable Tribunal’s process.
b.
No credible reason has been advanced by the Appellant to warrant extension of time to file appeal as provided under Section 13(4) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal.
c.
An application of this nature requires an Applicant to prove his/her absence from Kenya, sickness or other reasonable cause.
d.
Equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent. The Appellant ought to have acted swiftly to preserve its rights. It is guilty of laches.
e.
The application is an afterthought and delay tactic by the Appellant meant to delay the conclusion of the matter, which holds substantive Government revenue.
f.
The taxes demanded became due on confirmation of the assessments on 14
th
 October, 2019. They now continue to accrue interest and penalties as provided under the various tax laws as there is no valid Appeal before the Tribunal thus the Appellant ought to pay 50% on account to show commitment in the matter for the Tribunal to consider granting the orders sought.
g.
The Appellant has not demonstrated it deserves favourable discretion of this Honourable Tribunal and the application should be dismissed with costs to the Respondent.






Analysis and Findings


4.
In compliance with the directions of the Tribunal to the effect that the application was to be canvassed by way of written submissions, both parties duly filed their respective submissions that were adopted by the Tribunal on the 18
th
 April, 2014. The Tribunal has been appropriately guided by the submissions and the authorities cited by the parties in reaching at its findings hereinafter.






5.
In determining whether to extend time, the Tribunal was guided by the decision in the case of Leo Sila Mutiso -vs- Rose Hellen Wangari Mwangi - Civil Application No. Nai. 255 of 1997 (unreported), where the Court expressed itself thus:-
“
It is now well settled that the decision whether or not to extend the time for appealing is essentially discretionary. It is also well settled that in general the matters which this court takes into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are: first, the length of the delay; secondly, the reason for the delay; thirdly (possibly), the chances of the appeal succeeding if the application is granted; and, fourthly, the degree of prejudice to the respondent if the application is granted.”






6.
The Tribunal, guided by the principles set out in John Kuria v Kelen Wahito, Nairobi Civil Application Nai 19 of 1983 April 10, [1984] where the court used the following criteria to consider the application:-
a.
Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?
b.
Whether the appeal is merited?
c.
Whether the application for extension has been brought without undue delay?
d.
Whether there will be prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted?






a.Whether there is a reasonable cause for the delay?


7.
In considering what constitutes a reasonable reason for the delay, the court in Paul Wanjohi Mathenge v Duncan Gichane Mathenge [2013] eKLR, held that:-
“
...it is clear that the discretion to extend time is indeed unfettered. It is incumbent upon the applicant to explain the reasons for delay in making the application for extension and whether there are any extenuating circumstances that can enable the Court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant.”






8.
The Appellant intimated that the delay in filing an appeal as against the Respondent’s Notices of Confirmation of additional tax assessments issued on the 14
th
 October, 2019 was occasioned by the fact that the Appellant was following up with the Respondent to be supplied with the reasons for its decision and for the schedule of workings on how the amount of the liability had been determined.






9.
It is interesting that whilst the Appellant reiterated that it followed up for the reasons and the schedule of workings between 2020 and 2023 there is no indication on what finally prompted the Appellant, after the lapse of over 4 years, to seek to file the Appeal in the absence of the Respondent’s response to its incessant requests. The delay in the filing of the Appeal is obviously inordinate and with no reasonable explanation thereof.






10.
The Tribunal in its finding is persuaded by the Ugandan case of Ojara vs. Okwera (Miscellaneous Civil Application 2017/23) [2018] VGHCCD 42 where it was stated as thus:-
“
An order for enlargement of time to file the appeal should ordinarily be granted unless the applicant is guilty of unexplained and inordinate delay in seeking the indulgence of the court.”






11.
It is therefore the Tribunal’s finding that the Appellant has not established any reasonable cause for the delay.






12.
Having found as above, it is the Tribunal’s finding that there is no need in analysing the remaining factors for consideration as doing so would be an exercise in futility and a waste of the Tribunal’s time.






13.
The Tribunal in the circumstances finds that the application lacks merit and finds in favour of the Respondent.






14.
With the application for leave to file an appeal out of time having failed the Notice of Appeal and the Appeal documents filed simultaneously with the application have no legal foundation and the Appeal is thus unsustainable in law.










Disposition


15.
The Tribunal in the circumstances finds that the application lacks merit and the Appeal filed therewith is incompetent and the orders that accordingly recommend themselves to the Tribunal are as follows:-
a.
The application for extension of time be and is hereby dismissed.
b.
The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.
c.
No orders as to costs.

Ruling










1.
The Appellant moved this Tribunal vide a Notice of Motion dated the 25
th
 April 2024 filed under a Certificate of urgency on the 26
th
 April, 2024 and which is supported by an Affidavit sworn by Dr. Njoroge O. Kimani, an Advocate of the Appellant, on the 25
th
 day of April, 2024 seeking for the following Orders:
a.
That the Honourable Tribunal do issue an order lifting, vacating and setting aside the Respondent's Agency Notice Reference Number: PIN A000118925L and VAT 0018354 dated 10
th
 November 2014, issued to the Clerk of the Parliamentary Service Commission, appointing him as an agent and requiring him to pay Kshs 445,505,953 pending the full hearing and determination of this application and Appeal herein.
b.
That the Honorable Tribunal do issue an order restraining the Respondent either by itself, its agents, employees, servants or through any other person at its behest, from issuing any other Agency Notices against the estate of the deceased, or his Bank Accounts until this application and the Appeal are heard and determined.






2.
The application is based on the following grounds:
a.
That Respondent raised assessments against the Appellant which assessments were objected by the Appellant out of time on the 19
th
 August, 2019 as required by Tax Procedure Act.
b.
That the Respondent rendered an objection decision on 3
rd
 November 2023 on the Income tax and VAT against the Appellant.
c.
That being aggrieved by the objection decision aforementioned, the Appellant filed an Appeal to this Tribunal by lodging a Notice of Appeal, Memorandum of Appeal and Statement of Facts all dated 21
st
 November 2023.
d.
That there exists an Agency Notice No. PIN A000118925L and VAT 0018354 issued by the Respondent to the Clerk, Parliamentary Service Commission on 10
th
 November 2014.
e.
That if the Agency Notice to The Clerk, Parliamentary Service Commission is acted upon it will totally frustrate the Appeal herein and render it nugatory.
f.
That the amount the subject of the Agency Notice being Kshs 445,505,953/- is not the true and factual figure hence the reason of this Appeal and the declaration of agency for payment of the aforesaid amount by the Respondent is malicious.
g.
That it is in the interest of justice that this Honourable Tribunal does allow this application as prayed to safeguard the Appellant's right of appeal and right to be heard.






3.
The Appellant relied on its written submissions dated 27
th
 day of May 2024 wherein the Appellant submitted that in seeking to have the impugned Agency Notice lifted, the Applicant seeks preservation of the subject Appeal by having the enforcement of the Agency Notice stayed pending the hearing and determination of the Appeal.






4.
The Appellant submitted that the principles in granting stay are well enunciated in Tusho Capital Kenya Limited v Anthony Mbuthin Kiburi & Another [2019] eKLR where the court held that:-
“
The power of the court to grant and refuse an application for stay is discretionary. To stay execution must however be exercised in such away as not to prevent an appeal; The general principle in granting or refusing stay is, if there is no other overwhelming hindrance, a stay must be granted so that an appeal may not be rendered nugatory should that appeal court reverse the judge's discretion; a judge should not refuse a stay if there are good grounds for grunting it merely because in his opinion, a better remedy may become available to the applicant at the end of the proceedings; The court in exercising its discretion whether to grant or refuse an application for stay will consider the special circumstances of the case and unique requirements. The special circumstances in this case were that there was a large amount of rent in dispute and the appellant had un unqualified right of appeal.""






5.
The Appellant also submitted that the Respondent seeks to attach terminal dues and other benefits of the deceased’s estate before the Appeal herein is heard and determined. This if allowed would eternally prejudice the interests of the deceased’s estate as it would not be recoverable.






Response to the Application


6.
In response to the application, the Respondent relied on its Replying Affidavit sworn by Phillip Karonjo Kamau, an officer of the Respondent, on the 15
th
 day of May, 2024 and filed on the even date and the written submissions dated 22
nd
 May 2024 and filed on the even date.






7.
The Respondent’s case is that the late Mutula Kilonzo was an Advocate by profession and later became an MP, a Minister and a Senator. That the assessments were issued based on the incomes earned while practicing as an Advocate trading by the name Mutula Kilonzo & Co. Advocates.






8.
That the Appellant was registered under the PIN Number A000118925L for Income tax and 0018345E for VAT. That there are two facets to the dispute which are closely related and are as follows:
a.
Value Added Tax- An assessment which was issued on 6
th
 June 1998 for the period December 1994 with an amount payable of Kshs 166,685,413. Out of this amount, the principal tax was Kshs 36,791,000 while penalties & interest amounted to Kshs 129,894,413. An amount of Kshs 31,771,642 has so far been recovered through enforcement measures leaving a balance of Kshs 134,913,771.
b.
Corporation tax- The amount in contention from the year 1995 to 2001 totaling to Kshs 309,467,685.00 composed of Kshs 141,716,550.00 as principal tax and Kshs 167,751,135.00 as penalties and interest.






9.
The Respondent averred that the records available indicate that the dispute relating to the assessment was dealt with exhaustively and the assessments confirmed in the ledger on 18
th
 January, 2006.






10.
That through a letter dated 7
th
 August 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Appellant’s representative with reference to tax in arrears amounting to Kshs. 312,188,727.00 and requested for settlement of the pending tax within 14 days after issuance of the said letter. According to the Respondent, on 15
th
 August 2019, the tax agent, Kimani & Associates, responded to this letter objecting to the tax arrears demand notice on the basis that the income assessed was estimated and that, the objection was late due to the Appellant having passed away.






11.
The Respondent stated that the Appellant addressed a letter dated 5
th
 September 2023 and made reference to the letter dated 19th August 2019, seeking to make another “late objection”, and proceeded to adduce grounds for consideration. The Respondent also added that the Appellant, vide a letter dated 18
th
 October 2023 was tasked to avail some documents, which the Appellant failed to provide thus the Respondent rejected the objection application.






12.
It also stated that the assessments were issued earlier and dealt with, accordingly. Thus, the letter by the Appellant dated 19
th
 August 2019 was not a proper objection, but a response to a demand letter relating to confirmed self-assessment and additional assessment arrears. It maintained that the letter issued by the Respondent on 3
rd
 November 2023 served as a notification that the objection was not valid and as such, it was rejected in full.






13.
The Respondent averred that the outstanding taxes have not been fully paid therefore there is an Agency Notice in place, PIN A00011825L and VAT 0018354 dated 10
th
 November 2014 issued to the Clerk of the Parliamentary Service Commission. The Agency Notice has been in place since the year 2014.






14.
The Respondent stated that during that period, the Appellant failed to make any attempt to resolve the matter. Based on past engagements, the Appellant has not been keen to resolve the issue at all. The Respondent further stated that the Appellant’s interest is in having the Agency Notice lifted so that they can access any terminal dues payable by the Parliamentary Service Commission which would jeopardize the Respondent and lead to loss of tax revenue.






15.
The Respondent further stated that the total outstanding amount inclusive of principal tax, penalties and interest is Kshs. 445,505,953.00 which is inclusive of self assessment and additional assessment.






16.
The Respondent in its written submissions submitted that Sections 25 of the 
Income Tax Act
 2013 (repealed) provided for issuance of agency notices by the Respondent as part of its mandate. It also submitted that Section 52 of the 
Income Tax Act
 2013 (repealed) gave the Respondent the mandate to raise assessments.






17.
The Respondent relied on Section 42 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 that provides for the Respondent’s power to collect tax from persons owing money to a taxpayer while Section 43 of the said Act that provides for preservation of funds.






18.
The Respondent further relied on Section 51 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 which provides for objection to tax decision. It submitted that the taxes have been unpaid and that the Agency Notice has been in place since the year 2014 yet the Appellant has not made attempt to settle the matter.






19.
The Respondent submitted that no substantial loss will be occasioned to the Appellant in the event the orders being sought are not granted because the said issue is monetary and it has not been alleged or proved that in the event of recovery of taxes, the Respondent will be unable to refund the same. The Respondent relied on the case of James Wangalwa & Another v Agnes Naliaka Cheseto in Misc Applicati
on No. 42 of 2011
 [2002] eKLR in which  Gikonyo J. stated that:-
“
No doubt, in law the fact that the process of execution has been put in motion, or is likely to be put in motion, by itself, does not amount to substantial loss. Even when execution has been levied and completed, that is to say, the attached properties have been sold, as is the case here, does not in itself amount to substantial loss.






20.
The Respondent also submitted that the Appellant must establish other factors which show that the recovery of taxes will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the Appellant as the successful party in the Appeal.






21.
Finally, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant failed to show any prejudice it would suffer if the orders sought are not granted. It is the obligation of every citizen to pay taxes as and when they fall due.








Analysis and Findings


22.
The jurisdiction for the Tribunal to consider an application for stay of enforcement of any demand or actions on the part of the Respondent that is likely to adversely impact on the proper determination of a matter before the Tribunal is founded under Section 18 of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 which provides as follows; -
“
Where an appeal against a tax decision has been filed under this Act, the Tribunal may make an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision under review as it considers appropriate for the purposes of securing the effectiveness of the proceedings and determination of the appeal.”






23.
The Respondent on reliance upon Section 96 of the 
Income Tax Act
 2013 (repealed) and Section 25 of the VAT Act 2013 issued an Agency Notice directed to the Clerk, Parliamentary Service Commission for the enforcement of income tax and VAT in the sum of Kshs 445,505,953.00 as against the Appellant.






24.
Section 96 of the 
Income Tax Act
 (repealed) allowed the Respondent to appoint an agent for the purposes of the collection and recovery of tax due and upon such an appointment being made the agent was expected to remit the deducted tax within 12 months. This is clear under Section 96(3) of the Act which provided that:-
“
An agent shall pay the tax specified in his appointment notice out of any moneys which may, at any time during the twelve months following the date of the notice, be held by him for, or due from him to, his principal.”
From the provisions of Section 96(3) the agency notice was not meant to last for years and years without an end.






25.
Section 96(4) of the said Act was instructive on the obligations of the agent upon being appointed and it provided as follows:-
“
Where an agent claims to be, or to have become, unable to comply with subsection (3) by reason of the lack of moneys held by, or due from him, he shall, within seven working days, notify the Commissioner accordingly in writing setting out fully the reasons for his inability so to comply, and the Commissioner may -
(a)
Accept the notification and cancel or amend the appointment notice accordingly; or
(b)
If he is not satisfied with those reasons, reject the notification in writing.”






26.
The Respondent submitted that the Agency Notice was issued vide a letter dated 10
th
 November 2014 to the Clerk of the Parliamentary Service Commission. The Agency notice has been in place since the year 2014 to date. Pursuant to Section 96(3) of the 
Income Tax Act
 2013 (repealed), the agent was supposed to pay the tax not later than the 10
th
 November 2015. There is no indication as to the amount collected in enforcement of the agency notices.






27.
The Appellant vide a letter dated the 5
th
 September, 2023 applied to lodge a late notice of objection against the additional tax assessments for the period 1995 to 2021 in the aggregate sum of Kshs 166,685,408.00. The late objection was accepted by the Respondent on the 18
th
 October, 2023 thereby precipitating in the issuance of the objection decision on the 3
rd
 November, 2023.






28.
The Appellant being dissatisfied with the objection decision commenced this Appeal and the taxes informing the issuance of the Agency Notice on the 10
th
 November, 2014 appear to constitute part of the subject matter forming the substrum for the Appeal.






29.
The Appellant has contended and which fact has not been controverted by the Respondent that the enforcement of the Agency Notice issued to the Parliamentary Service Commission is likely, unless stayed by the Tribunal, to occasion in the deduction and remittance of any accrued benefits payable to the Appellant.






30.
It is apparent that the efficacy and effectiveness of the proceedings in the Appeal are likely to be prejudiced unless the enforcement of the Agency Notice is stayed pending the hearing and determination of the Appeal.






31.
In any event it is equally clear that the agency notice issued on the 10
th
 November, 2014 directed to the Clerk of Parliamentary Service Commission has outlived its statutory lifespan and as such its continued enforcement is not sustainable in law.








Disposition


32.
In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the application is meritorious and accordingly proceeds to make the following Orders:
i.
The application be and is hereby allowed.
ii.
The Agency Notice dated 10
th
 November, 2024 be and is hereby lifted.
iii.
No orders as to costs.






33.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The Claimant a registered trade union filed its Memorandum of Claim dated 27
th
 July,2021 and pleaded inter alia as follows: -
a.
The Claimant averred that it has valid recognition agreement and a CBA in force with the Interested Party herein which CBA was due to expire on 1
st
 June,2021 and was to remain in force until a new CBA was in place.
b.
The Claimant averred that its Constitution under rule 3 and 4 provided for membership of those at Interested Party employ. That on or about 16
th
 July,2021 the Respondent wrote a letter to the Interested Party requiring it to effect deduction of union dues attaching form S containing 98 employees of the Interested Party who were members of the Claimant union covered by the Recognition Agreement and current CBA between it and the Interested Party.
c.
The Claimant averred that the Interested Party being aggrieved by the Respondent’s decision and or request, opted to inform it of the intended sabotage of everlasting industrial peace which had been existing between the Claimant and the Interested Party and requested the Claimant to intervene and restore the said industrial peace which has been existing since 2013 by filing the suit.






2.
The Claimant in the upshot prayed for the following against the Respondent;
a.
A Declaration that the action and or inaction by the Respondent in encroaching and recruiting Claimant’s members are null and void ab initio.
b.
An Order compelling the Respondent to desist from recruiting and or holding itself as representing the Interested Party’s employees and or Claimant’s members in any manner whatsoever.
c.
A permanent Order restraining the Interested Party from deducting and remitting trade union dues to the Respondent from the employees who are members of the Claimant Union.
d.
Costs of the claim.






3.
The Respondent in reply filed its statement of Response dated 4
th
 August ,2021 which was unfortunately given a different number as ELRC Cause No. E649 of 2021.






4.
Parties on 21
st
 September,2021 agreed by consent to abandon both the Claimant’s Application and the Respondent’s Preliminary Objection to expedite hearing of the main suit. Parties did not call witnesses orally and proceeded on written submissions.






Claimants’ Submissions


5.
The Claimant filed its written submissions dated 29
th
 October, 2021 and submitted that article 41 of 
the Constitution
 was not absolute since under article 24(5) it could be limited by legislation. That the 
Labour Relations Act
,2007 was a statute specifically enacted to regulate all the affairs of Trade Unions and that once such a statute exists the limitation becomes lawful.






6.
On the issue of whether a trade union whose objectives in its constitution do not cover a particular sector or trade or industry is allowed to represent employees in that sector or trade or industry, the Claimant submitted that the limitation under Article 41 as read with section 14(1)(e ) and 2 of the 
Labour Relations Act
, it submitted that the Registrar has power to consider the objectives of Trade union which must provide for the areas of representation in terms of sectors or trade or industry.






7.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that the limitation enables trade unions and employers to engage in a manner which do not impede the economy because of protracted disputes between very many unions with a single employer. That this was escalated by section 54 of the 
Labour Relations Act
.






8.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that it was registered under its rule 3(a) of its constitution to represent workers in the glass industries or people dealing with glass individually and collectively. That in the Respondent’s constitution it was registered under rule 3(a) to represent employees engaged in General Mechanical Engineering and Metal Allied Manufacturing Industries.






9.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that the right of a trade Union to represent workers is limited by law. That a registered trade union cannot be allowed to tower all over sectors or trade or industries in the name of article 41 of 
the Constitution
. The Claimant distinguished the case of Mombasa ELRC Cause No 393 of 2015 between Amalgamated Union of Kenya Metal Workers V Dock Workers Union and Another by stating that both constitutions of Dock Workers Union and Amalgamated Union of Kenya & Allied Workers were sectorial and both drew their membership from transport sector of economy while in this case the unions are registered as Industrial unions.






10.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that unless section 14(1) (e) and 2 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 is either repealed or amended the law does not allow a trade union whose constitution does not confer upon a jurisdictional sector or trade or industry to represent its employees.






11.
On the issue of whether the Interested Party could effect deductions the same month it received form S from the Respondent the Claimant submitted that the Interested Party could only effect the instructions the next month and not the current month. That since the Respondent issued the instructions to the Interested Party on 16
th
 July,2021 the Interested Party could only effect deductions in August 2021 Payroll. That the deductions made on members on the month of July,2021 were unlawful and illegal.






12.
On the issue of reliefs sought the Claimant submitted that it was entitled to the same having proved that actions of the Respondent union to enlist employees who were in Glass industries in to its membership was in contravention of its own constitution as well as section 14(1) (e) and 2 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 and the fact that the Interested Party breached provisions of section 48 (5) of the 
Labour Relations Act
.








Respondent’s Submissions


13.
The Respondent filed its written submissions dated 5
th
 November,2021 and on the issue of whether individual entity constitution and Acts of parliament can supersede the country’s constitution the Respondent submitted the answer was a no as 
the constitution
 provides that any law that was or is in place which contradicts constitution was null and void.






14.
That the Claimant’s constitution was a closed shop representation which contradicted fundamental individual constitutional rights on the freedom of association and freedom to form and belong to union of their choice. The Respondent relied on the case of Mombasa ELRC Cause No. 393 of 2015 between Amalgamated Union of Kenya Metal Workers V Dock Workers Union and Another.






15.
On the issue of whether individual entity can take away fundamental rights ,the Respondent submitted on the negative that Interested Party employees chose a union of their choice being the Respondent in line with Article 36 and 41 of 
the Constitution
 by first withdrawing their membership from the Claimant and voluntarily joining the Respondent by signing check -offs forms (Form S).






16.
The Respondent submitted that this was not the first suit between the parties herein as there was another suit of this nature being ELRC Cause No. 761 of 2019 between the parties and Hebattullah Brothers Ltd whose judgment was delivered in favour of the Respondent.






17.
On the issue of whether union can be allowed to represent nonmembers in court who are members of another union without written authority or instructions, the Respondent submitted in the negative stating that the matter was not properly in court as Interested Party employees never complained on deductions of union dues as per sections 48 and 50 of the 
Labour Relations Act
.






18.
On the issue of whether the prayers sought were available in law the Respondent submitted that the same contravened the law which was Article 36 and 41 of 
the Constitution
 and section 48 of the 
Labour Relations Act
.






19.
On the issue of whether the Claimant had a single member at the Interested Party establishment the Respondent submitted to the negative because there was no check off forms filed before the court by the Claimant yet it is a mandatory requirement under section 48 of the 
Labour Relations Act
. That the Claimant could not purport to have members just because its constitution covers glass workers without the legal requirements and that the employees at the Interested Party are technicians specialized in engineering hence their rightful union was the Respondent.






20.
On the issue of Article 93 of 
the Constitution
 on establishment of the Parliament under Article 94(6) the Respondent submitted that the same was not disputed as it was enacted in 2010 when the Claimant Union was already in place and the 
Labour Relations Act
 2007 hence the same should be amended to the spirit of the current constitution on the rights and/or fundamental freedoms.






21.
The Respondent submitted that the Claimant should not force Interested Party’s employees in its union against their rights and limit their association with the Respondent. That the court should be on the forefront to protect the weak in the society because most trade unions after registration they become brief case unions without serving members just because in their mind it is closed shop practice that no other union should recruit from the sector hence exposing the employees to be at the mercy of employers when coerced to believe the union Secretary Generals are above 
the constitution
 even without service delivery to their members.








Determination


22.
The court has reviewed and considered the pleadings and submissions by the parties is of the view that the parties herein have not exhausted the internal dispute resolutions by referring this dispute to the Minister for conciliation. A trade dispute is defined under section 2 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 as :
trade dispute” means a dispute or difference, or an apprehended dispute or difference, between employers and employees, between employers and trade unions, or between an employers’ organisation and employees or trade unions, concerning any employment matter, and includes disputes regarding the dismissal, suspension or redundancy of employees, allocation of work or the recognition of a trade union;






23.
I have This court notes that the main issue in dispute herein is which Union should represent the Interested Parties employees. The two unions are fighting for the Interested Parties employees and the Court is of the that the issue be submitted to the Minister first as provided under 
Labour Relations Act
. Section 62 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 provides for reporting of trade disputes to the Minister who appoints conciliators to resolve the dispute. The Conciliators have power to resolve the dispute under section 67 of the 
Labour Relations Act
.






24.
If the I If the matter is not resolved after conciliation as per section 69 of the Act it is when the matter is referred to the court. This court is of the view that this dispute is not one of those urgent referrals to the Court under section 74 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 which provides as follows: -
A trade union may refer a dispute to the Industrial Court as a matter of urgency if the dispute concerns?
(a)
the recognition of a trade union in accordance with section 62; or
(b)
a redundancy where -
(i)
the trade union has already referred the dispute for conciliation under section 62(4); or
(ii)
the employer has retrenched employees without giving notice; or
(c)
employers and employees engaged in an essential service.






25.
ThThe issueThis court notes that this dispute is not one of those listed above hence it should be referred to the Minister for conciliation first before being referred to the Court






26.
Whereas Whereas this court notes that the employees have a right under 
the Constitution
 and section 4 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 to join any trade union of their choice, this court notes that the employer herein has not participated in the court’s proceedings hence it would be justified the matter be reported to the minister who will hear all the parties herein and hopefully provided a solution to dispute.






27.
Section 9 of 
Fair Administrative Action Act
 under 9(2) provides that the High Court/ELRC or a subordinate Court shall not review an administrative action or decision under the Act unless the mechanism including internal mechanisms for appeal or review and all remedies available under any other written law are first exhausted. Subsection 3 directs the court when faced with such an application to direct the applicant to first exhaust such remedy before proceeding to the court.






28.
This court in the recent case of 
Banking Insurance and Finance Union v Consolidated Bank of Kenya Limited (Cause E728 of 2022
) [2024] KEELRC 654 (KLR) (14 March 2024) (Judgment) held as follows:-
The exhaustion principle is a fundamental principle of administrative law whose intention is to subject disputes to available formal or even informal dispute resolution mechanisms before they are placed before a court of law for determination. It is an acknowledgment that disputes resolved through the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are more sustainable and long lasting than Court judgments which are costly and more often than not strain if not destroy relationships.
35.
The Court of Appeal in the case of Speaker of National Assembly v Karume [1992] KECA 42 stated thus: “Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. See also Geoffrey Muthinja Kabiru & 2 Others v Samuel Munga Henry & 1756 Others”






29.
In addition in Geoffrey Muthinja Kabiru & 2 Others – vs – Samuel Munga Henry & 1756 Others (2015) eKLR the court observed as follows:-
“
It is imperative that where a dispute resolution mechanism exists outside courts, the same be exhausted before the jurisdiction of the Courts is invoked. Courts ought to be fora of last resort and not the first port of call the moment a storm brews… The exhaustion doctrine is a sound one and serves the purpose of ensuring that there is a postponement of judicial consideration of matters to ensure that a party is first of all diligent in the protection of his own interest within the mechanisms in place for resolution outside the courts...This accords with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 which commands Courts to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution.""






30.
This court has nothing useful to add as the courts in the above cases referred the matter for conciliation as provided for in the recognition agreement and as per provisions of section 62 of the 
Labour Relations Act
. In the interest of serving justice to the parties herein the dispute herein is referred to the Minister to be resolved in 60 days and a report filed before the court for the recording of final orders or other directions






31.
The matter to be mentioned on 11
th
 November, 2024 for further directions.






32.
It is so ordered.

In Re-examination RW1 clarified that there was no assignment letter before the court and the Claimant’s terms in Oman were contractual in his contracts. That the 1
st
 Respondent did not have the Oman Contracts as Bahwan would have them. That Bahwan had been ordered to pay the Claimant relocation costs.








Claimants’ Submissions


23.
The Claimant through his written submissions dated 2
nd
 April, 2024 submitted on the issue of whether the Claimant went to Oman as an employee of the Respondents, that the Claimant was first employed by the 1
st
 Respondent in 1998 when the 1
st
 Respondent was by then called Tibbet and Britten Kenya Limited. That later the company changed its name to DHL Supply Chain Kenya Limited a fact which was common between the parties. Counsel further submitted that the Claimant was an employee of the 1
st
 Respondent and by virtue of the said employment the 2
nd
 Respondent being an international company could request the 1
st
 Respondent to second or assign the Claimant to work in or for any of the 2
nd
 Respondent’s subsidiary Company’s anywhere in the world in line with the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents policies and procedures.






24.
Counsel relied on clause 7 of the contract dated 24
th
 March 2013 which required the Claimant to work outside Africa and be entitled to relocation allowance as per prevailing relocation policy. That by a letter dated 20
th
 June,2013 the 1
st
 Respondent confirmed the Claimant’s appointment as the Vice President Business Development for Middle East and Africa effective 1
st
 July,2013 where he was to report to CEO, Middle East & Africa, Mr. Rob Ballentine and David Christmas SVP Business Development; APMEA.






25.
Counsel submitted that by a letter dated 28
th
 October 2014 the Respondent deployed the Claimant to work with another of its subsidiary companies in Muscat, Oman as the MD of Bahwan Exel LLC and the Claimant accepted the assignment and duly reported on duty.






26.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that on 27
th
 March,2015 the 1
st
 Respondent made a global announcement confirming the appointment of the Claimant within its joint venture in Oman Bahwan Exel. It was announced that effective 1
st
 April, 2025 Jeremy Hayson would take up the assignment of MD Oman reporting to CEO-MEA.






27.
Counsel submitted that the Claimant’s salary and other emoluments during his assignment were paid by the Bahwan Cybertek LLC but he continued to receive his work-related bonuses and the 2
nd
 Respondent company share options from the 2
nd
 Respondent. He further submitted that the Claimant’s employment with the 1
st
 Respondent was never terminated when he took the position of MD of the Joint venture partner Bahwan Exel LLC in Oman as the same was a mid to short term assignment for about 1-3 years but his assignment in Kenya was for 5 years and that his assignment was governed by midterm assignment policy where assignee would continue to be bound by the home country organization during the period of assignment. That the Claimant terminated his assignment in Oman as provided for under midterm assignment policy clause ii.






28.
Counsel submitted that the only one fully signed employment contract was the one dated 24
th
 March,2013 which had not been terminated or any final dues in any form paid by the Respondents to the Claimant.






29.
On the issue of Respondents’ breach of Claimant’s rights, counsel submitted that vide an email dated 6
th
 September,2019 the Claimant wrote to the 1
st
 Respondent concerning his treatment on his assignment in Oman where he raised several issues concerning his frustrations with the Respondents such as his unsigned contracts, unsubmitted permanent residency application forms, his request for a new role after completing his assignment was not answered. Further his exit settlement and terminal dues for the contract in force was to be settled if no new role or position was secured for him in his home country.






30.
Counsel submitted that on 7
th
 October,2019 the 1
st
 Respondent replied to the Claimant’s email where it admitted being aware of the Claimant’s relocation challenges and distress being caused to the Claimant and his family and undertook to discuss the matter and revert to the Claimant. That the Respondents were to cater for the Claimant’s costs of relocation but failed to do so and he had to pay for the said costs and expenses and further to date no new role or position had been given to the Claimant by the Respondent.






31.
Counsel submitted that after the Claimant having dutifully and diligently worked for the Respondents for over 20 years, the Respondents breached the Claimant’s legitimate expectations after termination of his assignment in Oman as he expected to be given a new role or a comparable position in his home country Kenya and if a comparable position was not available to have his contract of employment properly terminated with final dues settled in accordance with Kenyan employment and labour laws.






32.
On the issue of whether the Claimant was entitled to remedies claimed counsel submitted that the Claimant had illustrated that the Respondents did not cater for the special damages and he produced documents such as receipts and invoices of the expenses hence he was entitled for them.






33.
On the loss of salary counsel submitted that the Claimant was entitled to the same as well as other employment benefits.






34.
Counsel relied on the cases of Western Excavation Ecc Ltd vs Sharp (1978) 2 KLR 344 and Coca Cola East & Central Africa Limited vs Maria Kagai Ligaga (2015) eKLR on constructive dismissal. Counsel relied on the case of Banking Insurance and Finance Union(Kenya) vs National Bank of Kenya Limited (2018) eKLR on the order of reinstatement. Counsel also relied on the cases of GMV v Bank of Africa Kenya Limited and others on the award of general damages.






35.
Counsel submitted that secondment involves leaving the service of principal employer to a secondary one. That secondment does not constitute severance of the employees current employment and does not constitute creation of a new employment contract. That at the end of secondment the employee goes back to the previous employer. Counsel relied on the cases of David Barasa vs British Peace Support Team & Another (2016) eKLR and an Indian case of Centrica India Offshore PVT Ltd vs CIT (W.P) (C) No. 6807/2012 (Del) among others on the issue of secondment.






36.
Counsel submitted that the Claimant proved his case that he was never terminated from 1
st
 Respondent employment, that he went to Oman on a short-term assignment hence entitled to the reliefs sought in his claim.








Respondents Submissions


37.
The Respondents did not file their submissions either on the CTS or in the physical file, they did not attend court when the matter came up on 27
th
 May,2024 for mention to confirm filing of submissions and taking a judgment date and the court will rely on their pleadings filed in this court to make it analysis.








Judgment


38.
The court has reviewed and considered the pleadings by both parties and testimony by both parties and notes this Court’s ruling delivered on 24
th
 November,2022 by Lady Justice M.Mbaru I have  on the Respondent’s PO challenging the Jurisdiction of this court and the issue of the Claimant having sued the wrong Respondents. The Court observed clearly that the Claimant was an employee of the Respondents and the only valid contract was the one signed on 24
th
 March,2013 since the other Contracts at Oman were never signed. I agree with the ruling which remains valid unless challenged. The respondent although filed Notice of Appeal against the ruling never appraised the court of the fate of the appeal. The Court therefore frames for determination the following three issues.
a.
Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminated.
b.
Whether the Claimant’s rights of legitimate expectation and fair labour rights were infringed by the Respondents.
c.
Whether the Claimant is entitled to reliefs sought.








Whether the Claimant was unfairly terminated


39.
This court having established that the Claimant was an employee of the 1
st
 Respondent who could be seconded or assigned to work in 2
nd
 Respondent subsidiary companies outside Africa as stipulated in the Claimant’s contract then after the midterm Assignments, the Respondents were supposed to offer the Claimant a similar or comparable position in the home country Kenya. It came out clearly that the Midterm Assignment provided for assignee termination and clearly the Claimant had exceeded the period given for such assignments of 1-3 years as the Claimant had stayed for 5 years.






40.
This court notes that the Claimant invoked that clause which was Clause ii of the Policy and terminated the assignment in Oman having completed the same and notified the 1
st
 Respondent. The employment contract between the Claimant and the 1
st
 Respondent was never terminated since the Claimant went on the midterm assignments at one of the 2
nd
 Respondent subsidiary. The 1
st
 Respondent made the global announcement in 27
th
 March 2015 that the Claimant would be taking over the MD role at Bahwan Exel LLC. There was no mention of termination of his contract.






41.
The court further notes that the Claimant was also never paid any terminal dues under his Kenyan Contract and that the payment to the claimant as shown in his payslip was bonus for the 2014-2015. Whereas this court notes that this was a peculiar case of secondment where the employee after secondment goes back to the previous employer, the Respondents refused to cater for the Claimant’s relocation costs and refused to offer him a suitable position in the home country despite him using his own means to relocate.






42.
The court also notes that the Respondents did not terminate the Claimant’s contract as per employment laws if they did not have a suitable position for him. The Respondents alleged that they tried to source jobs for the Claimant in Europe and UK but he declined but during hearing it came out clearly that the Respondents’ witness did not have any document in court to show that the Claimant declined any job offers.






43.
In the circumstances the Court takes the view that the claimant was constructively dismissed and in a manner that amounted to unfair termination. The Claimant confirmed that in as much as his salary and emoluments were paid in Oman currency by the Bahwan Exel LLC, his work-related bonus and company shares options were paid by the 2
nd
 Respondent in Kenya shillings.






44.
The principle of constructive dismissal was elucidated by the Court of Appeal in the case of Coca Cola East & Central Africa Limited v Maria Kagai Ligaga [2015] eKLR where it was observed as follows:-
The key element in the definition of constructive dismissal is that the employee must have been entitled or have the right to leave without notice because of the employer’s conduct. Entitled to leave has two interpretations which gives rise to the test to be applied. The first interpretation is that the employee could leave when the employer’s behavior towards him was so unreasonable that he could not be expected to stay - this is the unreasonable test. The second interpretation is that the employer’s conduct is so grave that it constituted a repudiatory breach of the contract of employment - this is the contractual test. The contractual test is narrower than the reasonable test.






45.
In this case the breach of the Claimant’s labour rights amounted to constructive dismissal on the part of the Respondents.








Whether the Claimant’s rights of legitimate expectation and fair labour rights were infringed by the Respondents.


46.
This court has already established that the Claimant was entitled upon resigning in Oman to return to home country and a similar position or comparable one be given to the Claimant by the Respondents since he was still their employee as per Clause 1 (ii) of the policy. The Respondents refused to cater for the Claimant’s relocation costs despite vide the email of 7
th
 October,2019 in reply to the Claimant’s concerns acknowledging that they understood the challenges with the Claimant’s relocation and the distress caused to his family. The employment contract provided that he could work outside Africa and in case of permanent relocation he be entitled to company sponsored relocation as set out in the Company’s prevailing relocation policy as per clause 7.1 and 7.2 of the Contract.






47.
The Claimant had legitimate expectations that once he comes back to his country he would continue working with the Respondents and if there was no suitable position that his terminal dues would be paid and his contract be properly terminated as per Kenyan laws. The same did not happen hence breaking the Claimant’s expectations who had worked with them for over 20 years.






48.
The threshold in determining a claim for an alleged breach of a legitimate expectation is as determined in Mary M Gitao & 3 Others v Chief Registrar – Judicial Service Commission &amp; 3 others [2017] eKLR where the Court is required to consider three key issues.
(1)
Whether a legitimate expectation has arisen
(2)
Whether it would be unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation and
(3)
If it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.”






49.
In this case it was clear the same expectations were breached by the Respondents. The claimant alleged that the Respondents refused to cater his relocation cost together with his family, refused to renew his work permit and permanent residence permits. The last renewal was in 2017 while he was still undertaking his assignment in Oman. The Respondents ought to have maintained those records up to date and catered for the Claimant’s relocation costs as provided for in their policy documents.






50.
The court notes that it came out clear that the Claimant sued the Bahwan Company for relocation costs which the court ordered it to pay but still that does not mean that his rights were not infringed. This amounted to unfair labour practices under Article 41 of the Constitution and breach of the Claimant’s constitutional rights.








Whether the Claimant is entitled to reliefs sought


51.
Once the Court finds that the employee was unfairly terminated the first remedy is usually damages for unfair termination. In this case the Claimant sought for reinstatement which is one of the relief under section 49 of the Employment Act but since it is more than 2 years since the parties parted ways in 2019 this prayer is not tenable. When it comes to damages for unfair termination this court is guided by considerations under section 49(4) of the Employment Act. The Claimant had worked with the Respondents for over 20 years since 1998, the nature of his termination which was unlawful together with breach of his rights entitles him to the maximum compensation of 12 months.






52.
The prayer for special damages fails since the same was awarded in the Oman court case. The prayer for loss of salary and other benefits also fails this being an employment contract which could come to an end due to other factors other than termination like death among others. The Court is purely governed by the section 49 of the Employment Act on what to award which must be related to those given under the Act.  In the case of Engineer Francis N. Gachuri v Energy Regulatory Commission [2013] eKLR (Industrial Cause No. 203 of 2011) the court held as follows:
“
There is no provision for payment of damages to the date of retirement. This is because employment like any other contract provides for exit from the contract. The fact that the Claimant’s contract was referred to as permanent and pensionable does not mean it could not be terminated and once terminated, he can only get damages for the unprocedural or lack of substantive reason for the termination. No employment is permanent. That is why the Employment Act does not mention the word “permanent employment.”






53.
In conclusion the Claim is found merited and is hereby allowed as follows: -






54.
In conclusion the Claimant’s claim is hereby allowed with      costs as follows:
a.
12months’ salary as compensation for unfair termination……Kshs 22,222,812/=
b.
Certificate of service if not issued.
c.
Costs of the suit
d.
The award shall be subject to taxes and statutory deductions where applicable but shall attract interest from the date of judgment until payment in full.
It is so ordered.

Between




David Kimanthi Maitha


 


Appellant




and




National Bank of Kenya Ltd


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the Ruling of the Honourable Wendy K.Micheni, C.M delivered on 9th June 2023 in Milimani commercial   courts   CMEL   No. 1555 of 2019  between David Kimanthi Maitha vs National Bank of Kenya Ltd)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Through the Memorandum of Appeal dated 27
th
 June, 2023, the Appellant appealed against the ruling of Honourable Wendy K Micheni (CM) delivered on 9
th
 June, in Milimani Chief Magistrates Court Employment Cause No. 1555 of 2019 between David Kimanthi Maitha vs National Bank of Kenya Ltd.






2.
The Appeal was based on the grounds that:
i.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law by upholding the Respondent’s preliminary Objection dated 12
th
 April,2022.
ii.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law by failing to consider the Appellant’s submissions.
iii.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law by upholding the Respondent’s Preliminary Objection despite initially directing parties to place the matter before a court of competent jurisdiction for hearing and determination.
iv.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law by allowing the Respondent’s Preliminary Objection and thus dealing a blow to the Appellant’s right to access to justice.






3.
The Appellant prayed that the appeal be allowed with costs and the Ruling of the Honourable court dated 9
th
 June,2023 be set aside and substituted with an order dismissing the Respondent’s Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 12
th
 April,2022. That the Appellant’s suit against the Respondent be reinstated with an order to the Appellant to beseech the Honourable Court to transfer Nairobi MC. ELRC NO.1555 of 2019- David Kimanthi Maitha v National Bank of Kenya Ltd to the Employment and Labour Relations Court for hearing and determination. That in the alternative this Honourable court be pleased to transfer Nairobi ELRC NO. 1555 of 2019- David Kimanthi Maitha V National Bank of Kenya Ltd therefrom to the Employment and Labour Relations court for hearing and determination.






4.
The Appeal was disposed of by written submissions.






Appellants’ Submissions


5.
The Appellant filed written submissions dated 15
th
 March, 2024 and on the issue of whether the Learned Magistrate erred in law by dismissing the suit herein on the ground of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction counsel submitted that the suit at lower court filed in 2019 resulted from the Respondent’s variation of the interest rate chargeable on the Appellant’s loan facilities from staff rate of 4.5% to commercial rate of 13% per Annum contrary to the Respondent’s loan policy on exiting members of staff.






6.
The Appellant submitted that it was not in dispute that at the time the Appellant was exiting the Respondent’s employment in February,2018 he was earning a gross salary of Kshs. 318,083.00 which was above the limit for trial court of Kshs. 80,000/=. That the filing of the suit at the trial court was an innocent mistake on the part of the Appellant’s counsel who erroneously believed that in a suit with multiple distinct claims as this one with commercial and employment dispute the determinant for jurisdiction to adjudicate suit of such nature was the applicability of the pre-dominance purpose test while relying on the case of Elias Maundu Makau v I & M Bank Limited(2021) eKLR.






7.
Counsel submitted that it believed that the employment dispute was secondary and auxiliary to the loan interest issue which would be determined in the cause. That mistakes of an advocate are excusable and the court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction to ensure a party is not locked out of seat of justice. Counsel relied on the case of Murai v Wainina (No 4) 1982 KLR 38.






8.
Counsel submitted that on 12
th
 April,2022 when the matter came up for taking directions for the hearing of the suit the trial court certified the matter ready for hearing and directed parties to fix the matter for hearing within 14 days from the date thereof before a court with competent jurisdiction. That the Respondent responded instantly and within hours of the court’s directives by filing and serving the Preliminary Objection alleging the court lacked pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the matter.






9.
Counsel further submitted that the Respondent’s swift action was misconceived and meant to deny the Appellant chance to place the suit at the right court as directed by the trial court. That the trial court erred by entertaining the Preliminary Objection on jurisdiction when it had already pronounced itself on the matter directing the parties to place the matter before a competent forum for determination and without inquiring whether the directions had been complied with.






10.
Counsel submitted that the trial court did not also consider the Appellant’s submissions on exercising its inherent jurisdiction to allow the Appellant to move the relevant court to transfer the claim in the event it lacked jurisdiction. That the trial court should have in the interest of justice allowed the parties to move the relevant court for transfer of the claim.






11.
Counsel relied on the case of Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union v Cargill Kenya Limited & Another (2020) eKLR where the chief magistrate declined to entertain a claim because of pecuniary jurisdiction and the Claimant sought to transfer the suit to the right forum. The Respondent filed a preliminary Objection. The Chief Magistrate dismissed the Preliminary objection and allowed the Claimant to transfer the claim to ELRC.






12.
Counsel submitted that the Appellant should be allowed to transfer the suit to ELRC or in the alternative this court while exercising its discretion should transfer the suit to ELRC.






13.
On the issue of whether this court can vacate the orders of the trial court and transfer the Claim to ELRC counsel submitted that in the spirit of oxygen principles under section 3 of the Employment and 
Labour Relations Act
, the power bestowed upon the court under section 12(3)(viii) of the said act this court can set aside the orders of the trial court dismissing the suit herein and transfer therefrom to ELRC.






14.
Counsel relied on the cases of Harun Kiptarus Tanui v East African Portland Cement Plc (2022) eKLR and Ndung’u v Fapcl Group (Miscellaneous Applicati
on E111 of 2022
) (2023) KEELRC 634(KLR) (17 March 2023) Ruling. Counsel submitted that this court should not allow the Appellant to be condemned unheard. That the Appellant filed his suit although in the wrong forum within the stipulated period under section 90 of the 
Employment Act
 which was within 3 years. That he has all along acted in good faith and the Respondent at some point had offered to settle the matter out of court even though nothing came out of it.






15.
Counsel while relying in the above case of Harun Kiptarus supra submitted that there was no useful purpose served by striking out a case filed in wrong jurisdiction other than punishing a party that acted in good faith. That the Appellant all along acted in good faith and this court should be persuaded to vacate the trial court orders.








Respondent’s Submisssions


16.
The Respondent filed its submissions dated 9
th
 May, 2024 and on the issue of whether the Appellant was entitled to the reliefs sought most specifically the claim to be transferred to ELRC for hearing and determination the Respondent submitted that the Appellant was not entitled to the reliefs sought. That the Appellant filed his case in the lower in full disregard of the pecuniary limits of Kshs 80,000/= and upon being stopped by the court by its ruling he now seeks to set aside the ruling and transfer the suit to ELRC.






17.
Counsel relied on the case of The Owners of the Motor Vesssel “Lillian S” Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) (1989) EKLR on jurisdiction. Counsel also relied on the case of Equity Bank Limited vs Bruce Mutie Mutuku t/a Diani Tour Travel (2016) eKLR on jurisdiction of the Court in transferring incompetent suits to the right forum. That the suit herein in the trial court was incompetent from inception and the court ought not to sanctify it.






18.
Counsel submitted that there was no competent suit capable of being transferred at this stage to the ELRC for hearing and determination. Counsel relied on the case of Albert Chaurembo Mumba & 7 Others vs Maurice Munyao &148 Others (2019) eKLR while affirming the finding in the case of Kageni vs Musiramo & Another(1968) EALR 43 on courts not transferring suits where the matter was brought to a court without jurisdiction in the first place.






19.
Counsel submitted that the orders sought by the Appellant were therefore dead on arrival and incurably defective from inception because the transfer of the file from the lower court is a court of first instance that lacked jurisdiction to one that has competent jurisdiction. That allowing the orders would be tantamount to breathing life in to an incompetent suit.








Analysis & determination


20.
This court has considered the pleadings by both parties and the submissions by the parties and this being a first Appeal the court will proceed to reanalyze the evidence before it as was held in the case of Selle vs Associated Motor Boat Company Limited [1968] E.A 123 thus:-
An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities……..or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






21.
In this case, the Ruling of the trial court was that the PO is upheld and the suit be and is dismissed with costs of the Application to the Respondent. The Appellant was therefore aggrieved by this ruling hence this Appeal. The court has therefore from the pleadings and proceedings herein come up this with one main issue;
a)
Whether the reliefs sought by the Appellant can issue.








Whether the reliefs sought by the Appellant can issue.


22.
It is not in dispute that the Appellant filed his suit at the lower court which has pecuniary jurisdiction of monthly salary not exceeding Kshs 80,000/= The Appellant last salary was Kshs 318,083.00. Counsel for the Appellant explained that this was a mistake on his part where they thought the employment dispute was secondary to the issue of interest on loan determination and that mistake of counsel should not be meted on an innocent party who acts in good faith.






23.
The Respondent on other hand has submitted that the lower court did not have jurisdiction in the first instance and allowing the orders would be giving life to an incompetent suit by transferring the suit to the competent court. That jurisdictional issue is not one that can be cured by article 159 of 
the Constitution
.






24.
The court notes that on 12
th
 April,2022 the trial court certified the matter ready for hearing and directed parties to fix hearing date within 14 days before the Court with competent jurisdiction. This means that the court upon realizing that it did not have the pecuniary jurisdiction it downed its tools as per the case of The Owners of the Motor Vesssel “Lillian S” Vs Caltex Oil (Kenya) (1989) EKLR where the court’s hands are tied once it has no jurisdiction. The Respondent upon the said directives rushed to court through its PO on jurisdiction dated the same date.






25.
This court notes that this move was not done in good faith by the Respondent who barred the Appellant from making the necessary steps to have the matter transferred to the ELRC as directed by the trial court. This court asks itself if the matter was filed in 2019 why did the Respondent not raise the PO at the earliest opportunity but only raised this after the court gave the directions that it did not the pecuniary jurisdiction? Why did the Respondent wait for the limitation period of 3 years to end in order to raise this issue unless it had some malice?






26.
This court notes that the trial court ought not to have entertained the Respondent’s PO after it gave its directions unless it confirmed that its directions of 12
th
 April,2022 were not followed by the Appellant.






27.
The court appreciates that mistakes of advocates should not be meted on innocent clients and that the courts should lean more towards doing justice in any case provided no prejudice would be occasioned to the other party. The right and the just thing the trial court would have done was to insist on its directives of 12
th
 April,2022 for the Appellant to initiate the process of transfer the suit to the right forum instead of dismissing the same. The trial court ought to have been awake to the fact that employment matters under section 90 of the 
Employment Act
 are only instituted within 3 years and there is no provision for extending such timelines. By the time the trial court dismissed the Appellant’s suit in 2022, three years had lapsed meaning it would have not been possible to file a fresh suit.






28.
In dismissing the suit, the trial court placed. The appellant in undue hardship and was counter to the Oxygen principles under section 3 of the Employment and 
Labour Relations Act
. In Harun Kiptarus Tanui v East African Portland Cement Plc [2022] eKLR Lady Justice Maureen Onyango observed as follows: -
In the decision I observed that in Ruth Muthoni Mwangi v Kenya Meat Commission and Prisca Jepng’etich v Generation Career Rabidness Social Initiative Limited [2021] eKLR the court dismissed a similar application while in Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Union v Cargill Kenya Limited & Another [2020] eKLR and Ali Jarso Wako & another v Ministry of Interior & Coordination of National Government & 5 others; Public Service Commission & 5 others (Interested Parties) [2020] eKLR, the courts held that a suit filed in a court without jurisdiction can be transferred to a court with jurisdiction… In the said suit, I held that this court can transfer such a suit by virtue of Article 159 of 
the Constitution
, and Section 3 and 12(3)(vii) of the 
Employment and Labour Relations Court Act
…. I have again considered the conflicting decisions. In my view none of the decisions of the higher courts, that is the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, have dealt with the specific issue whether a suit filed in the Magistrates Court without pecuniary jurisdiction would be incapable of being transferred by this Court to itself for hearing and determination.






29.
In 
Kenya Plantation & Agricultural Workers Union v Eastern Produce (K) Limited (Miscellaneous Application E004 of 2023
) [2023] KEELRC 2444 (KLR) (12 October 2023) (Ruling) Lady Justice Wasilwa faced with a similar situation had this to say: -
“
Where such matters should be filed is informed by 
legal Notice No 6024 of 2018
 which states that matters to be handled by the subordinate courts are matters where the employees’ salaries fall below 80,000/= save for those under the 
Labour Relations Act
…This matter is such as one that falls within the labour relations for which the court with jurisdiction is the ELRC. I therefore agree with the applicants herein and allow the application seeking to transfer this matter to the ELRC.






30.
From the above cases it appears that there is no clear decision of a superior court prohibiting the transfer of a suit filed in wrong court to a court of competent jurisdiction. The matter is therefore left to doing justice to the situation which leans more on preserving the suit than dismissal on a ground that would not occasion prejudice to the respondent not compensable by costs. In conclusion the Appeal herein succeeds with no orders as follows:
a.
The Orders of the trial court of 9
th
 June,2023 are hereby set aside.
b.

Respondent







        
          ((Being an appeal against part of the judgment and decree of Hon.  Ms G.  M Gitonga issued in Milimani Commercial Courts Court  Employment Cause No. E827 of 2020 between Dalvin Bosibori  Momanyi Vs Thomas & Piron Grand Lacs Limited delivered on 17th  May, 2023))
        
      






Judgment










1.
Through the Memorandum of Appeal dated 16
th
 June, 2023, the Appellant appealed against part of the Judgment of Hon. G.M Gitonga delivered on 17
th
 May, 2023 in Milimani Chief Magistrates Court Employment Cause No. E827 of 2020 between Dalvin Bosibori Momanyi Vs Thomas & Piron Grand Lacs Limited.






2.
The Appeal was based on the grounds that:
i.
The Learned Magistrate erred in fact and law in finding that the lawful procedure was not followed in terminating the Respondent’s employment by way of redundancy.
ii.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law in awarding compensatory damages of Kshs 420,000 and awarding severance pay of Kshs 66,635 at the same time.
iii.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law in awarding Kshs 46,667 for leave days earned but not taken in the absence of evidence of such leave days not having been taken.
iv.
The Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in calculating severance pay using the formula (15/26 days x35,000 x 3.3 years) arriving at Kshs 66,635 instead of (15/30 days x 35,000 x 3 complete years of service) coming to Kshs 52,500.






3.
The Appellant prayed that the appeal be allowed with costs and the Judgment of the trial court awarding compensatory damages of Kshs 420,000, leave days of Kshs 46,667, severance pay of Kshs 66,635 instead of Kshs 52,500 be set aside.






4.
The parties by consent on 22
nd
 January,2024 agreed that the Appellant pays the Respondent uncontested amount of Kshs 122,500/= and costs of the lower court within 21 days and the remainder of the contested amount was to be deposited in joint interest earning account pending the determination of this appeal.






5.
The Appeal was disposed of by written submissions.






Appellants’ Submissions


6.
The Appellant filed written submissions dated 2
nd
 May, 2024 and on the issue of whether the trial court erred in finding that the lawful procedure was not followed in terminating the Respondent’s employment by way of redundancy, counsel submitted that the trial court erred. That the Respondent’s termination was fair both substantially and procedurally and done in accordance with 
Employment Act
.






7.
Counsel submitted that the reasons for termination were valid and were communicated to the Respondent and due process followed in terminating the employment as per section 45(2) of the Act.






8.
The Appellant submitted that an employer is allowed to make his business more efficient for example by automation, abandonment of unprofitable activities, reorganization or other saving steps. Counsel relied on the case of James Ngunia Kinyua v Oserian Development Company Limited (2017) eKLR on the same.






9.
It was the Appellant’s submissions that the reason for the termination of the Respondent’s employment was valid based on operational requirements of the Appellant and the trial magistrate erred in not taking this in to account. That on or around April 2020, the appellant undertook a massive process of restructuring and reorganization necessitated by hardships occasioned by prevailing strained financial and operational conditions as a result of Covid-19 pandemic.






10.
The Appellant submitted that as a result of the said reorganization the Respondent position was declared redundant which fact was communicated to the Respondent and a meeting was held between the Respondent and itself and officially communicated to the Respondent. That because of swift measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus including the dusk to dawn curfew it was making losses faster than it anticipated hence had to move quickly to arrest the situation by declaring redundancy.






11.
It was the Appellant’s submissions that Covid 19 was a force majeure that made it to declare redundancy at the earliest as it could not continue operations one more month with the kind of obligations it had to all its employees as it was losing business steadily as a result of the pandemic. That it informed the Respondent union as required by law and offered to pay the Respondent all her dues and pending leave days and the union never responded.






12.
On the issue of whether the trial court erred in awarding compensatory damages of Kshs 420,000/= and awarding severance pay of Kshs 66,635/= at the same time the Appellant submitted that the trial court erred as it ought to have awarded either of them but not both. That severance pay was payable to employee declared redundant under section 40(1) (g) of the 
Employment Act
.






13.
Counsel submitted that where court finds termination to be unfair on account of redundancy it can only award damages for unfair termination. Counsel relied on the case of Gas Kenya Limited v Odhiambo (Appeal E006 of 2022 (2022) KEELRC 3930 (KLR) 22 September 2022 (Judgment). Counsel insisted that the Respondent was terminated fairly hence entitled to severance pay.






14.
It was the Appellant’s submissions that the trial court erred in using the formula (15/26 days x 35,000 x 3.3 years) arriving at Kshs 66,635/= instead of 15/30 days x 35,000 x 3 complete years of service) coming to Kshs 52,500/=. That a month has 30 days with a short month having 28 days. That the formula used was wrong and the same should be calculated on completed years.






15.
On the issue of whether the trial court erred in awarding Kshs 46,667/= for leave days not taken the Appellant submitted that whoever alleges must prove as per section 107 of 
Evidence Act
. The Appellant relied on the case of 
Jennifer Nyambura Kamau v Humprey Mbaka Nandi NYR CA civil Appeal No. 342 of 2010
(2013) eKLR.






16.
Counsel submitted that the Respondent did not provide evidence before the trial court showing that she had leave days that she did not take. That averments in pleadings are not evidence while relying on the case of Shaneebal Limited v County Government of Machakos (2018) eKLR.






17.
The Appellant submitted that if the Respondent was of the opinion that relevant evidence was in the Appellant’s possession she ought to have applied to court to have the court issue an order compelling the production of the said evidence. Counsel relied on the case of Casmir Nyaberi v Mwakikar Agencies Limited (2016) eKLR.








Respondent’s Submisssions


18.
The Respondent filed her submissions dated 26
th
 March, 2024 and on the issue of whether the trial court erred in declaring that she was terminated unlawfully she submitted that this court should not interfere with the trial court decision which was merited. That she was declared redundant on 31
st
 March,2020 without any notice and the Appellant refused to pay her terminal dues.






19.
It was the Respondent’s submissions that the Appellant’s allegations that there was a meeting between it and her before termination was not true as the Appellant did not produce evidence to show that such meeting took place. That she was terminated orally and went to her union to complain. The Respondent relied on section 40 of the 
Employment Act
 on redundancy.






20.
Counsel submitted that it was not disputed that the Respondent was terminated on account of redundancy but the Appellant did not prove that the termination was fair as per provisions of law while relying on sections 43 and 45 of the 
Employment Act
 on prove of reasons for termination and the same to be lawful respectively.






21.
The Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not adduce evidence to demonstrate the alleged difficult financial situation at the material time hence the termination was malicious, unfair, unjust and unlawful. Counsel relied on the case of Kenya Airways Limited vs Aviation & Allied Workers Union of Kenya & 3 others (2014) eKLR on redundancy and submitted that the Appellant did not have proof of the company going through financial difficulties. That the Appellant did not produce the company’s financial records to show they were going through hard times. That she was not notified of the redundancy neither her union hence unfair termination.






22.
On the issue of if the trial court erred in awarding compensatory damages of Kshs 420,000/= and award of severance pay of Kshs 66,635/= at the same time the Respondent submitted that declaration of redundancy was a process and not an event. That once court finds the termination was unlawful it is supposed to award damages for unfair termination. Counsel relied on the case of Ken Freight E.A v Benson Nguti(2016) eKLR.






23.
Counsel submitted that an award under section 49 (a) was different from award under section 49(1) (b) (c). That section 49 allows an award to include any of the listed remedies provided that the court making the award exercises its discretion judiciously and is guided by section 49(4) (m). That she was properly awarded 12 months under Section 49(1) for unlawful termination and for unlawful redundancy.






24.
On the issue of whether the trial court erred in awarding Kshs 46,667 for leave days the Respondent relied on section 28(1) of the 
Employment Act
 on leave. That the Appellant should have ensured the Respondent took her annual leave when due or made payment in lieu.








Analysis and determination


25.
This court has considered the pleadings by both parties and the submissions. This being a first Appeal the court will proceed to reanalyze the evidence before it as was held in the case of Selle vs Associated Motor Boat Company Limited [1968] E.A 123 thus:-
An appeal to this court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect. In particular, this court is not bound necessarily to follow the trial judge’s findings of fact if it appears either that he has clearly failed on some point to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities……..or if the impression based on the demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence in the case generally.”






26.
In this case, the Judgment of the trial court was that judgment was entered in favour of the Claimant as follows:-
a.
One Month’s Salary in lieu of notice Kshs 35,000/=
b.
Salary for the month of March, 2020 Kshs 35,000/=
c.
Severance Pay (15/26 x 35,000 x 3.3) = Kshs 66,635/=
d.
Leave days earned but not taken (1,167 x 40) = Kshs 46,667/=
e.
Compensatory damages (35,000 x 12) =Kshs 420,000/=
TOTAL = Kshs 603,302/=
f.
Costs and interests from the date of filing suit
g.
Certificate of service to be issued within 45 days.






27.
The Appellant was therefore aggrieved by part of the judgment and challenges the decision of the trial court finding the Respondent’s termination as unlawful, challenges the award of compensatory damages as well as the severance pay stating that the Respondent was fairly terminated hence entitled to severance pay alone and even if the court finds the termination was unfair not to award both awards. The Appellant also faults the formula adopted by the trial court in calculation of the severance pay and also challenges the award of leave days not taken.






28.
From the pleadings and proceedings herein, this court has come up with three main issues;
a.
Whether the trial court erred in finding that the Respondent was unfairly terminated.
b.
Whether trial court erred in awarding compensatory damages and severance pay at the same time.
c.
Whether the trial court erred in awarding the Respondent leave days not taken.






Whether the trial court erred in finding that the Respondent was unfairly terminated.


29.
It is not in dispute that the Respondent was terminated on account of redundancy. Redundancy has been defined under section 2 of the 
Employment Act
 and that courts have stated severally that even in cases of redundancy the reason ought to be valid under section 43 of the 
Employment Act
 and the employee given a right to be heard under section 41 of the 
Employment Act
 hence a termination on account of redundancy will be an unfair termination under section 45 of the 
Employment Act
 if it is shown that the employer did not comply with the requirements undersection 40 of the Act.






30.
In Kenya Airways Limited vs. Aviation and Allied Workers Union of Kenya and 3 Others (2014) eKLR, the Court of Appeal pronounced itself as follows:
“
Thus, redundancy is a legitimate ground for terminating a contract of employment provided there is a valid and fair reason based on operational requirements of the employer and the termination is in accordance with a fair procedure. As Section 43(2) provides, the test of what is fair reason is subjective. The phrase “based on operational requirements of the employer” must be construed in the context of the statutory definition of redundancy.
What the phrase means, in my view, is that while there be underlying causes leading to a time redundancy situation such as reorganization, the employer must nevertheless show that the termination is attributable to redundancy – that is that the services of the employee has been rendered superfluous or that redundancy has resulted in abolition of office, job or loss of employment.”






31.
From the above, it is clear the reason has to be valid and a fair procedure has to be followed. In this case the Appellant stated that it was going through financial difficulties due to Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Appellant did not adduce evidence such as its financial statements to illustrate that it was going through financial difficulties. This reason therefore fails the validity test under section 43 of the 
Employment Act
.






32.
On the process undertaken by the Appellant, it is trite law that even in redundancy, the procedure under section 41 of the 
Employment Act
 on the right to be heard has to be followed. This court agrees with the trial court that the Appellant did not follow the right procedure in declaring the Respondent redundant. The Respondent was not given notice of the redundancy.






33.
Section 40 of the 
Employment Act
 is the guiding law on the process of redundancy which provides as follows;-
(1)
An employer shall not terminate a contract of service on account of redundancy unless the employer complies with the following conditions –
(a)
where the employee is a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the union to which the employee is a member and the labour officer in charge of the area where the employee is employed of the reasons for, and the extent of, the intended redundancy not less than a month prior to the date of the intended date of termination on account of redundancy:
(b)
where an employee is not a member of a trade union, the employer notifies the employee personally in writing and the labour officer ;
(c)
the employer has, in the selection of employees to be declared redundant had due regard to seniority in time and to the skill, ability and reliability of each employee of the particular class of employees affected by the redundancy;
(d)
where there is in existence a collective agreement between an employer and a trade union setting out terminal benefits payable The 
Employment Act
, 2007 47 upon redundancy; the employer has not placed the employee at a disadvantage for being or not being a member of the trade union;
(e)
the employer has where leave is due to an employee who is declared redundant , paid off the leave in cash;
(f)
the employer has paid an employee declared redundant not less than one month’s notice or one month’s wages in lieu of notice; and
(g)
the employer has paid to an employee declared redundant severance pay at the rate of not less than fifteen days pay for each completed year of service.






34.
From the above provision it is clear that the Appellant although stated that they notified the Respondent’s union there was no such evidence and in fact it is the union who wrote to it after the Respondent complained. The union was also supposed to be issued with a month’s notice of the intended redundancy which never happened. Besides, there was no set down criteria of the employees to be rendered redundant as required by the Act. On the other conditions of notice pay of one month wages were not met by the Appellant as well as severance pay provided by the Act.






35.
The Respondent was not notified or given a chance to express her views which is against the clear provisions of the law under section 41 of the 
Employment Act
. The Respondent was also not consulted as no evidence was adduced by the Appellant to show that the meeting took place and the Respondent was consulted on the said issue.






36.
In conclusion this court agrees with the trial court that the Respondent’s termination was not for a fair and valid reason and was procedurally flawed hence unlawful and unfair termination under section 45 of the 
Employment Act
.








Whether trial court erred in awarding compensatory damages and severance pay at the same time.


37.
The Appellant stated that the trial court ought to have awarded either of the awards and not both. That if the court finds the termination to be unfair it should only award damages for unfair termination alone and not severance pay. This court therefore having agreed with the lower court on the unfairness of the termination asks itself if it should interfere with the trial court discretion on the award of damages.






38.
This court as an appellate court can only interfere with such discretion if there was an error on some matters leading to erroneous decision as was held on the case of Kenya Revenue Authority & 2 others v Darasa Investments Limited (2018) eKLR where the court held;
The court ought not to interfere with the exercise of discretion unless it is satisfied that the Judge misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision, or that it be manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of discretion and occasioned injustice.






39.
In this case the court has found the termination to be unfair and it is trite law whenever it finds the termination to be unfair it proceeds to award damages for unfair termination under section 49(1)(c) of the Act. Section 49(4) of the 
Employment Act
 guides this court on the considerations this court ought to take in awarding the damages herein. This court takes note that the Respondent started working with the Appellant in January 2017 and was terminated in March 2020. That this is a period of 3 years three months.






40.
The trial court awarded the Respondent 12 months compensation for unfair termination without any justification. The Court of Appeal in Kenya Broad casting Corporation v Geofrey Wakio(2019) eKLR held that;
(22)
This Court has established the rule that an award of the maximum 12 months’ pay must be based on sound judicial principles. In Ol Pejeta Ranching Limited vs. David Wanjau Muhoro [2017] eKLR this Court categorically stated that the trial Judge must justify or explain why a claimant is entitled to the maximum award; that the exercise of discretion must not be capricious or whimsical.






41.
This court therefore is of the view that the trial court ought to have awarded an amount which was reasonable in the circumstances. Whereas the Court agreed with the trial Court that the appellant never provided any evidence to show it was undergoing financial difficulties, this court takes judicial notice that Covid-19 negatively impacted on businesses and the world economy at large and it was not farfetched for the appellant to allege that its operations were impacted upon by the pandemic. The Court therefore in the circumstances awards the respondent four months’ salary as compensation for unfair termination in substitution for the full twelve months awarded by the trial court. The Respondent is further entitled to one-month notice pay as well as severance pay under the Act.






42.
The Court now ventures in to the other question of whether after awarding the award of compensation for unfair termination if it can award severance pay at the same time. This court notes that an award of severance pay is provided for under section 40(1) (g) where an employee is declared redundant. This award is statutory regardless whether the termination is found to be unfair or not. An award under section 49(1)(c) is compensatory and is intended to compensate an employee who has been terminated for invalid reasons and or using an unfair procedure.






43.
Regarding the calculation of what is payable under section 40, these are well stipulated. An employee in entitled to 15 days salary for each complete year of service. There is no provision for payment of a portion of the year. That is to say, the Act does not provide for a prorated payment. The Appellant submitted 15/30 days x 35,000x 3 years which equals to Kshs 52,500/=. This is the correct calculation and the trial court therefore erred by using the wrong formula.






44.
In conclusion the trial court did not err in awarding both the compensatory damages and severance pay at the same time since both are distinct.








Whether the trial court erred in awarding the Respondent leave days not taken.


45.
It is not in dispute that leave is an entitlement under section 28 of the 
Employment Act
 and an employer must ensure an employee takes it when due. The same was an entitlement under clause 9 of the employment contract herein at 21 working days. However, the same is valid three years before filing of the suit. In the case of Charles Muthusi Mutua v Kathi No Kakoka Services Limited [2022] eKLR the court had this to say:-
Bearing in mind the provisions of Section 90 of the 
Employment Act
, I can only grant untaken unpaid for leave days for the three years preceding the date of filing this claim. Not the five years sought by the claimant. Therefore, Kshs. 27,844.50. Leave to employees is a statutory entitlement, and an obligation on the employer to ensure that the right is realized, under section 28 of the 
Employment Act
. Where an employee alleges that he did not enjoy this right during the currency of the employment fully or to a certain extent, then it behooves the employer to disabuse the allegation by tendering evidence before the trier. The Respondent as the employer didn’t.






46.
In this case the Respondent filed her claim in September 2020 the same year she was dismissed in March 2020. Her claim for leave pay for the three years where she was claiming 40 days was therefore valid and not time barred under section 90 of the 
Employment Act
. On the issue of burden of proof once the Respondent alleged that she did not take her leave days as per the above case the burden shifted to the Appellant to adduce evidence that she indeed took her leave. The Appellant is the custodian of employment records as provided for under section 74 of the 
Employment Act
 and it ought to have produced evidence to the contrary without stating that the Respondent must have applied to court for the production of the documents.






47.
It was the Appellant’s burden to adduce evidence to dispute the Respondent’s allegations. The trial court did not therefore err in awarding the Respondent her unpaid leave days.






48.
In the upshot the Appeal partially succeeds as follows.
a.
The 12 months’ salary compensation for unfair termination is substituted with four months’ salary as compensation at Kshs 140,000/=
b.
Severance pay is substituted from Kshs 66,635/= to Kshs 52,500/=
c.
Leave days not taken remains at Kshs 46,667/=






49.
The other prayers not challenged in this appeal remain the same and since the appeal partially succeeds each party shall bear their own costs for this Appeal.






50.
It is so ordered

The Claimant filed his Statement of Claim dated 19
th
 January, 2021 and pleaded inter alia as follows: -
a.
The Claimant was employed by the Respondent by a letter dated 7/10/2013 as a Sales Manager drawing a gross monthly salary of Kshs. 692,750/= which salary was reviewed over time to Kshs. 705,750/=.
b.
The Claimant averred that vide a letter dated 17/3/2020, the Respondent unlawfully and unfairly terminated the Claimant’s employment.
c.
The Claimant averred that on 30/6/2017 while serving as a Sales Manager, the Respondent abruptly issued a transfer order to the Claimant and asked him to report for duty as SHEQ Manager which the Claimant understood to be a demotion and reluctantly accepted the redeployment.
d.
The Claimant averred that Contrary to the Respondent’s Performance Management Policy, Job Competence and Education Assistance Policy, the Respondent declined to prepare and train the Claimant for the new position of SHEQ Manager.
e.
The Claimant averred that the position of a SHEQ Manager was a new area of work to the Claimant hence the abrupt dropping in his performance in the year 2018 to which he substantially improved in 2019 following his self-learning on the job.
f.
The Claimant further averred that on 1/4/2019, for no valid or genuine reason, the Respondent demoted the Claimant to the position of officer – SHEQ and assured the Claimant that his terms and conditions of employment would remain unchanged but offered no training and/or guidance to the Claimant.
g.
The Claimant further averred that he recorded tremendous performance in the years served and oversaw success of major projects.
Procedural Injustice
h.
The Claimant further averred that he diligently served the Respondent in his positions as sales manager, Manager SHEQ and Officer SHEQ until 26/2/2020 inviting him to an incapacity inquiry on 3/3/2020 prior to which he has not been issued with any warning in regards to the alleged poor performance.
i.
The Claimant further averred that on 3/3/2020, the Claimant attended the incapacity inquiry meeting as instructed and it later turned out at the meeting that the Claimant had actually been invited for disciplinary meeting and not an incapacity inquiry as earlier informed.
j.
The Claimant averred that he was not served with a notice to Show Cause setting out the charges leveled against him prior to the disciplinary hearing nor a prior warning contrary to the law and Respondent’s Disciplinary Code.
k.
The Claimant averred that he was not given to an opportunity to state his case in defence prior to the disciplinary hearing and/or given witness statement and adduce his evidence.
l.
The Claimant averred that the Disciplinary Committee as constituted offended the code of the Respondent. The chairman of the Disciplinary hearing and the Respondent’s representatives actually asked the Claimant to proceed and plead his mitigation during the hearing/before the verdict ignoring the Defence tabled by the claimant.
m.
The Claimant averred that the chairman referred to the Respondent’s broke and trust on the Claimant which allegation had ever been brought to the Claimant’s attention.
n.

i.
Failure to timelessly prepare and plan for the external BSI Audit for ISO 9001,14001 AND 18001.

The Claimant averred that on 31/3/2020, the Claimant appealed against the said decision to terminate his employment but instead the Respondent engaged in justification process on appeal. The Respondent endeavored to seal the missteps, illegality and unfairness of the disciplinary process exposed by the appeal. The appeal was not heard.
q.
The Claimant averred that he was terminated at a time when the Respondent’s business was performing badly and was working to cut its costs and expenses which saw it send some of its employees on retrenchment /redundancy and yet chose to terminate the Claimant on discriminatory terms.
r.
The Claimant averred that he performed well, achieved the set goals and even earned bonus under the STIP ordinarily payable in April every year and the hurried termination of employment of the Claimant in March 2020 was calculated to deprive the Claimant of his STIP bonus.

EVIDENCE


4.
The Claimant (CW1) testified in court on the 13
th
 March, 2024 where he adopted his updated witness statement together with the pleadings filed in court dated 19
th
 January, 2021. It was his testimony that he was aware of the Respondent’s statement by one Catherine Kamau dated 19/6/2023. Further, that he never worked with the witnesses as she was not in employment when he left.






5.
It was his case that he received a rating of 2, but was unsure how it was determined as the Respondent typically used a qualitative rating system. He also testified that he outlined his objectives and achievements for 2017 and the overall achievement for the year was 89.80%, with individual targets accounting for 20% and organizational targets for 80%. He scored 20% on individual targets and 69.8% on organizational targets, resulting in a total achievement of 89.8%. However, his overall rating may still be influenced by the company's overall performance.






6.
CW1 testified that he had a performance rating of 3 out of 5 for the year 2017 in the CBD system and was required to do a self-appraisal before the managers evaluated him. He further stated that a rating of 3 meant he met his objectives, while a rating of 2 is considered lower but that he disagreed with this assessment.






7.
CW1 testified that Macjessie Mula was part of the peer to peer engagement. He indicated areas where he needed more support, and Macjessie provided job coaching in quarter 4 of 2019, specifically in December after he had been put on performance training.






8.
In Cross-examination CW1 testified that he claimed Kshs. 7,128,000/- in the demand letter. Further, that page 19 of the RBD showed that in 2016 his salary was Kshs 91,630/- and in 2015 it might have been different. He also testified that he was a part of the Respondent’s team from October 2013 to March 2020 and went through PIP processes in 2015 and 2019, but did not remember if he had one in 2014 or 2016. He underwent PIP four times in total, and his performance made up 20% of the organization's overall performance, which was 80%.






9.
It was his case that the contract of employment included provisions for termination, which he was given notice of. That he underwent a performance evaluation hearing and was presented with charges in a letter, to which he responded and the final decision would be made by the chairman. That he was dissatisfied with the process and decision, as it was not consistent with organizational procedures.






10.
CW1 testified that he was not informed of the charges against him at that time. He responded to the letter on 2/3/2020, and the disciplinary hearing took place on 3/3/2020. During the hearing, the issues mentioned in the letter were discussed, and he was ultimately terminated due to performance incapacity.






11.
It was further his case that there was Procedural injustice when allegations had been made and investigations done or clearly obtained first before the letter for disciplinary hearing issued. Therefore, that he was unfairly terminated and the documents submitted by the Respondent in court were never supplied to him.






12.
He also testified that he was discriminated since the sales manager was retrenched in February but he was terminated and that he was not aware if he was subjected to PIP.






13.
In Re-Examination CW1 confirmed that Poor performance was in COR and is referred to be a minor offence. That no counselling was done. He was not given a verbal warning. He was given a PIP which he considered a warning but it is not what is contemplated in the COR.






14.
CW1 asserted that he never received final warning and the required procedure was not followed. Similarly, that he was not told his performance was under investigation and so after he pleaded not guilty and tendered his evidence, the Respondent should have considered the evidence before asking him to mitigate failure of which meant he had made up his mind. His position was that poor performance did not deserve summary dismissal. Further, that he still received bonus despite the PIP.






15.
The Respondent on the other hand called one witness Catherine Kamau (RW1) who testified in court on13/3/2024 and adopted the Respondent’s documents filed in court as well as her evidence in chief. RW1 testified that she was the Respondent’s HR and had not worked with the Claimant.






16.
It was her case that the Clamant had been on PIP since his employment from 2014 to 2019. She further testified that on 1
st
 September 2019, the Claimant did not do what he was required to do and was issued with a show cause letter and he responded. The response was not satisfactory and a disciplinary hearing was constituted.






17.
RW1 testified that the Claimant was paid all his terminal dues upon termination.






18.
In Cross-examination RW1 testified that at page 92-93, the letter does not make reference to the 4 PIPs. That a PIP has a life span, it expires. The last PIP was in 2014. It can be revisited later if the issue is still the same and there as a PIP for 90 days which were to end in December 2019. Further, that at page 92, PIP on reasons for incapacity inquiry indicated poor performance.






19.
RW1 testified that the dates for certification were set by the Claimant and auditors. There was audit in 2019 and dates set (BSI auditors). The dates were changed to 3/6/2019 and an email sent by BSI setting a new date. The audit was done in June, 2019.The lead person was to do the corrections in time for the audit.






20.
RW1 testified that compliance was a continuous process. The site was not ready for audit. That page 162 of the RBD showed the charges against the Claimant. She however did not have the audit report in court. The audit was successful and ISO Certificate was issued.






21.
RW1 testified that there should be a supervisor at a petrol station and the pump attendant and supervisor ought to report incidents. That the Claimant was a Safety Officer and waste was under safety.






22.
RW1 also testified that there was report from BSI-audit on the leakage and waste management and the Claimant as SHEQ was the custodian of the documents. He was the one to push Shevalyne to act on the leakage. Shevalyne was the same level as the Claimant.






23.
It was her case that that she knew the Kisumu site was to be rolled in 2019. The Kisumu audit was a one-day audit and the Claimant was informed in February of the audit and ought to have prepared himself.






24.
In re-Examination RW1 confirmed that roll out in Kisumu was scheduled in May but executed in November, 2019. No reason was given by the Claimant. RW1 confirmed that waste and leakage was under Supply Chain Manager but the Claimant gets involved as SHEQ officer. RW1 further stated that failure to meet deadline has got to do with performance. The PIPs were documented in the Claimant’s file.








Claimants’ Submissions


25.
The Claimant filed written submissions dated 8
th
 May, 2024.On the issue of whether the disciplinary process under the code was followed, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent departed from its own set procedures.






26.
It was the Claimant’s submissions that by a letter dated 26/2/2020, the Respondent invited the Claimant to attend an Incapacity Enquiry on 3/3/2020 to assess the Claimant's ability to perform his role as a SHEQ Officer, listing 5 instances of alleged incapacity or poor performance.






27.
The claimant submitted that the Disciplinary Code provides the Guidelines that any disciplinary action must meet the requirements of fairness as laid in the Code and more specifically that disciplinary action must be both procedurally and substantively fair.






28.
It was the Claimant’s submission that the Code sets out offences for which an employee may be dismissed summarily and the second paragraph specifically excludes poor performance and offences of a minor nature from the penalty of summary dismissal providing a summary of the Disciplinary process to be invoked for both serious and minor offences.






29.
It was the Claimant’s submission that before inviting the Claimant to the Enquiry on 3/3/2020, the Respondent was under obligation to follow the four progressive steps set out in the Code, namely:
a)
Counseling Procedure
b)
Verbal Warning Procedure
c)
Written Warning Procedure
d)
The Final Written Warning.






30.
It was the Claimant’s submission that the Respondent breached Section 41 of the 
Employment Act
, article 41 of 
the Constitution
 read together with Article 47 on fair administration by flouting its own disciplinary code and justifying that that the Claimant had previously been placed under a performance improvement plan (PIP) for which reason the Claimant was disentitled to due process.






31.
The Claimant submitted that the notice of Incapacity Enquiry dated 26
th
 February, 2020 purporting to be a disciplinary enquiry failed to inform the claimant of the exact nature of the alleged offences or contraventions, the consequences or penalty likely to be imposed and suffered by the Claimant.






32.
The Claimant submitted that placing the Claimant under Disciplinary Enquiry was a violation of the Code. The alleged offences or contraventions were not the subject of any warning or proceeded by the mandatory final written warning. The alleged events were not current or of the nature and magnitude requiring 
the constitution
 of a Disciplinary Enquiry. That there was no sufficiently just and valid cause to discipline the Claimant.






33.
The Claimant submitted that in respect of substantive fairness, the Code requires that there be sufficiently just and valid cause for applying the disciplinary action. It was the Claimant’s submission that the Respondent made a mistake by considering expired PIPs in their decision-making process. That the Respondent provided a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) to the Claimant, which expired on 30/11/2019 and if there was no improvement, disciplinary action would have been taken.






34.
The Claimant submitted that the Respondent’s claim that the PIP was revived on 26/2/2020 was not true as the matters in the PIP were closed within the set timeline. It was the Claimant’s submission that the Claimant was terminated by the Respondent based on unfounded allegations of substandard work, which were not backed up with evidence. That the Chairman of DE did not provide any specific examples of substandard work and disregarded the Claimant's defence. The Notice of Incapacity Enquiry-Poor Performance used as justification for termination was not part of the Respondent's Disciplinary Code, which only provided for a Disciplinary Enquiry with established procedures and consequences.






35.
The Claimant submitted that the termination letter provided by the Respondent did not give specific reasons for dismissing the Claimant, only stating it was based on a recommendation from the Chairman of Incapacity Enquiry. It was the Claimant’s submission that the committee was improperly constituted and did not follow the correct procedures for termination. The notice given to the employee was not in line with the disciplinary code and was too short.






36.
On the issue of whether there was substantive fairness the Claimant submitted that his performance was rated without his involvement, and there was no feedback from his superior to support the score. That the Claimant self-assessed his performance at 92% and received a final score of 91% after review by his superior. Despite positive feedback from both Line Managers, the Respondent later revised the Claimant's performance rating to 2 out of 5 during a disciplinary hearing without providing any supporting documentation which rating was seen as an attempt to force the Claimant out of office. The Claimant relied on the case of Banking Insurance and Finance Union (Kenya) vs Barclays Bank of Kenya Limited and Another (2016) eKLR and submitted that a fair performance appraisal process should involve participation from both parties, with the employee being included in the evaluation process.






37.
It was the Claimant’s submission that the Respondent did not follow its performance management policy and did not provide the Claimant with clear and achievable targets and that the Respondent's line manager and other officers seemed determined to dismiss the Claimant, making vague accusations and using past incidents against him.






38.
The Claimant relied on the case of Maina Mwangi v Thika Coffee Mills Limited [2014] eKLR and submitted that performance appraisals must meet specific criteria and involve employee participation in order to be valid.






39.
On the issue of whether the Charges were wide and general, unclear and lacking in specificity, the Claimant relied on the case of In Lydia Moraa Obara v Tusker Mattresses Limited [2021]eKLR and submitted that section 43 of the 
Employment Act
 places upon the employer an obligation to prove the reason or reasons for the termination, failing of which the termination shall be deemed to have been unfair within the meaning of section 45.






40.
The Claimant submitted that the Respondent in the first charge accused the Claimant of failing to prepare for an external audit, which risked the company's ISO certification. However, the specific details of the alleged unpreparedness were not provided and the Claimant showed evidence of informing Line Managers about the audit dates and corrective action plan.






41.
The Claimant submitted that the Claimant did not mix up dates for a BSI audit as alleged. The audit dates were changed by BSI from July to June, despite efforts to maintain the original dates. That the Claimant successfully organized the audit despite the short notice, and the audit report did not blame the Claimant for any shortcomings. The rumor that the Respondent was at risk of losing ISO certification was sensationalized and unfairly blamed on the Claimant.






42.
It was the Claimant’s submission that on the second charge, the Claimant prepared the Environmental Aspects and Impacts Register in 2019, which led to the ISO 14001 Environmental Certificate being granted to the Respondent. The Claimant further submitted that during the hearing, the Respondent admitted that the Claimant's efforts contributed to the certification. That the Health and Environmental Policy from February 2019 stated that Line Managers, not the Claimant, were responsible for operating in line with the policy.






43.
It was the Claimant’s submission that during cross-examination, Catherine Kamau, a witness for the Respondent, acknowledged that the environmental management on site was not the Claimant's responsibility, but rather that of Shevalyne Opiyo, who reported to the Respondent's Managing Director.






44.
On the third charge, the Claimant submitted that the accusation against the Claimant was broad and unsubstantiated, with no evidence provided to show that he provided incorrect information during an engineering audit. That the tasks allegedly not completed were said to be critical for ISO 14001 requirements, but no specific instructions were presented to support this claim.






45.
On the fourth charge, the Claimant submitted that the charge against the Claimant was not specific enough for him to adequately defend himself, as he was bombarded with new allegations and duplicated charges.






46.
The Claimant relied on the case of 
Sani v JSC (Cause 7 of 2019
) [2022] KEELRC 4000 (KLR) and submitted that it was important that employees are made aware of charges in advance and having specific charges to respond to.






47.
On the fifth charge the Claimant submitted that the charge against the Claimant was initially related to a Kisumu site but the evidence presented was on a Mombasa site, leading to inconsistencies and misleading statements. The Claimant's right to a fair hearing was violated due to changes in the charges and lack of prior notice for new allegations. The employer was not allowed to change or add charges after a hearing has begun if it would be prejudicial.






48.
On the issue of whether the Claimant is entitled to damages for discriminatory treatment, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent discriminated the Claimant contrary to Article 27 of 
the Constitution
 and has not proven otherwise as provided under section 5(7) of the 
Employment Act
 2007.






49.
The Claimant relied on among others the case of Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd & Another v Gladys Muthoni & 20 Others [2018]eKLR in defining discrimination in employment.






50.
It was the Claimant’s submission that the Respondent treated the Claimant unfairly and discriminatorily compared to other employees and did not follow proper procedures when terminating the Claimant, while another employee who performed poorly was given more favourable treatment.






51.
On the issue of whether the Claimant is entitled to a payment of salary arrears, the Claimant submitted that the Claimant is owed salary arrears totalling Kshs. 1,411,500/= for the two months between termination and appeal. That it was acknowledged by the Respondent that employees remain employed and entitled to salary during the appeal process.






52.
On whether the Respondent owes the Claimant due and unpaid bonuses, the Claimant submitted that the respondent failed to pay the claimant a bonus of Kshs. 1,270,350 earned under the STIP program for the year 2019, which was supposed to be paid in April 2020.That the termination did not affect benefits already accrued, and the bonus should have been paid in April 2020 regardless.






53.
The claimant further submitted that he was unable to find a job during the pandemic and suffered financial difficulties due to the termination, including defaulting on loans. That the respondent also refused to provide him with a certificate of service, causing further distress to the claimant and his family.






Respondent’s Submissions


54.
The Respondents filed their written submissions dated 24
th
 April 2024 and on the issue of whether the Claimant was lawfully terminated, submitted that the Claimant informed the Court that he was unfairly demoted in the year 01.04.2019 when in fact he was not demoted due to the reorganization of the Respondent's organizational structure, his title was changed from SHEQ Manager to Officer SHEQ but all his benefits including salary and allowances were maintained and he indeed lost nothing and this could not qualify as a demotion.






55.
The Respondent submitted that the Claimant had a history of poor performance from 2017 to 2019 and was notified of his performance issues in February 26, 2020 and invited to an incapacity inquiry on March 3, 2020 and that the Claimant was given a fair hearing before being terminated, as the issues were discussed before the decision was made.






56.
It was the Respondents’ submission that the Claimant admitted that the company's performance was declining, leading to restructuring to cut costs and further submitted that the claim of discrimination was unfounded and intended to discredit the Respondent. That the Claimant confirmed participation in a disciplinary hearing hence could not claim unfair treatment.






57.
On the issue of what reliefs if any are available to the Claimant the Respondent submitted that the Claimant was rightfully terminated and was not entitled to any of the requested benefits, such as pension, retirement benefits, NHIF contributions, loan repayments, or salary during the appeal process. The Respondent further submitted that there was neither basis nor proof of claim for the alleged constructive dismissal nor compensation for unfair and unlawful termination. It was therefore the Respondent’s submission that the Claimant was not entitled to any of the relief since the reasons for their termination are valid and proven under Section 40 of the 
Employment Act
.  The Respondent in this regard relied on the cases of Musau Kivuva v Mastermind Tobacco Ltd and Nyangiry Okabanga Bwonditi v Ecobank (K) Ltd, and submitted that the Claimant's claim was dismissed because of poor performance despite being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan.










Determination


58.
The Court has reviewed and considered the pleadings, testimonies and submissions by both counsel in support and opposition to the case. The court has also considered authorities relied on by Counsels and has come up with two main issues;
i.
Aa. aa.Whether the Claimant’s termination of employment was unfair and unlawful
ii.
WHEHWWwWhetherWhetherWheWhether the Claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought.


59.
Whether the Claimant’s termination of employment was unfair and unlawfulI have WhethrWWhwr








60.
In this instant case, the Respondent alleged that they terminated the Claimant on grounds of 5 instances of alleged incapacity or poor performance. It is the Respondent’s case that the Claimant was lawfully and fairly terminated for valid reasons of poor performance even after being subjected to Performance Improvement Plan.






61.
On the other hand, it was the Claimant’s case that he was unfairly terminated by the Respondent when they among others; carried on a disciplinary hearing without giving him a Notice to show cause and taking his defence or witness; failed to record statements from the claimant’s accusers and/ or competent evaluators on the charges against the Claimant; failed to frame and inform the Claimant the subject of disciplinary hearing prior to the hearing; failed to record a charges against the Claimant prior to the hearing in breach of the Respondent’s HRM; failed to take a written statement from the Claimant on the matter subject to disciplinary hearing; resorted to a disciplinary hearing without the input of the Claimant; failed to constitute the Disciplinary Committee contemplated under the Disciplinary Code authorizing a biased chairman to hear and determine the Claimant’s case and disregarding the Defence given by the Claimant at the disciplinary hearing and on appeal.






62.
The events leading to the termination of employment of the Claimant points out to poor performance as the main reason for the termination. There was also the issue of discrimination of the Claimant by the Respondent which the court will address hereunder.






63.
CW1 testified that he was discriminated against because the sales manager was retrenched in February but he was terminated instead. Under section 5 of the 
Employment Act
, once an employee presents prima facie evidence pointing to discriminatory treatment against her by the employer, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to demonstrate that there was no discrimination as alleged by the employee. This was considered in the case of G M V v Bank of Africa Kenya Limited [2013] eKLR).






64.
The claimant herein had a history of allegations of poor performance against him. He admitted to being placed on PIP more than once and that his performance was found not to have improved. He further conceded that poor performance was a ground for termination of employment and that he was made aware of that while being placed on PIP. Therefore the claimant cannot claim that because he was terminated and the sales manager retrenched, he was discriminated against. The claimant did not demonstrate that the sales manager too was placed on PIP but retrenched instead of being terminated like was his case.






65.
Whereas section 5 of the 
Employment Act
 places the burden of proof of non-discrimination once alleged by an employee on the employer, it does not mean that the employee needs to barely allege discrimination. An employee alleging discrimination ought to sufficiently present the facts in support of such allegation. To merely allege without any iota of facts would place an employer on an awkward mission of trying to look for evidence to rebut a bare allegation. This in my view was not the intention of the drafters of section 5. To this extent the claimant has not sufficiently demonstrated that he was discriminated against to shift the burden to the. Respondent.






66.
The Claimant in its submissions stated that the Notice of Incapacity Enquiry-Poor Performance used as justification for termination was not part of the Respondent's Disciplinary Code which only allows for a disciplinary inquiry with specific procedures and consequences. However, a closer look at the Respondent’s Disciplinary Code reveals a very elaborate procedure provided for in page 11-38; the disciplinary process, the investigation procedure, the counselling procedure, the verbal warning procedure, the written warning procedure, the final written warning procedure, disciplinary inquiry procedure, the appeal hearing procedure and considering grounds for appeal. The court further notes that during hearing, it was CW1’s testimony that poor performance is on COR but according to him was referred to as a minor offence.






67.
As observed above, the claimant underwent PIP more than once. It was his evidence that in all the PIP’s he was appraised and his only complaint was that the rating he gave himself significantly differed with the one given by the respondent. The claimant further conceded that he underwent four PIP’s. This was confirmed by the respondent’s witness who stated that the claimant was placed on PIP right from 2014 when he was employed in 2015, 2016 and 2019. This in the Court’s view was not a good track record for performance for the claimant and it was not therefore surprising that the respondent decided to terminate his service on account of poor performance.






68.
Sections 41, 44 and 45 entitles an employer to discipline its employees based on poor performance as the capability of an employee to perform their duties is an essential requirement of the contract of employment. Termination of employment due to poor performance is therefore a valid and fair reasons for termination.






69.
In the case of Thomas Odol Ojwang versus Kenol Kobil Ltd [2015] eKLR the court set out the principles that the Respondent needs to incorporate in the Performance Development Plans, the Performance Improvement Plan and the capability hearings which tools/practices are to be consistent with section 41 of the 
Employment Act
 and article 47 of 
the constitution
 and on fair administrative action.






70.
Regarding procedural fairness it is now an established principle that for termination to pass fairness test there should be both substantial and procedural fairness in a number of cases including in the case of Janet Nyandiko versus Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (2017) eklr and Walter Ogal Anuro v Teachers Service Commission [2013] eKLR.






71.
When poor performance is alleged, an employer is required by the law, other than the employment contract to give the employee notice, give a hearing, and give reason(s) for termination on such a ground. It is not only a contractual requirement; there exists a legal requirement that before termination on the grounds/reason of poor performance, there must exist genuine, valid and fair reasons. The subject employee must be given a hearing in the presence of the employee’s representative and most fundamentally, there must be a written notice stating the reasons upon which the employer intends to terminate employment to enable the employee give their defence. This notice must be issued before an employer makes a decision to terminate employment.






72.
CW1 stated that on February 26, 2020, he received a letter inviting him for incapacity inquiry on 3
rd
 March, 2020. He responded to the letter on 2
nd
 March, 2020 and the disciplinary hearing took place as scheduled. During the hearing, the issues mentioned in the letter were discussed, and he was ultimately terminated due to performance incapacity. He appealed against the decision. The Court was not appraised whether the appeal was heard or not and the outcome thereof.






73.
From the foregoing, the Court is reasonably satisfied that the respondent accorded the claimant procedural fairness while considering the termination of his employment.






74.
In conclusion the Court finds the claim in its entirety without merit and the same is hereby dismissed with costs.






75.
The respondent will however issue the claimant with a certificate of service.






76.
It is so ordered.

Between




Charles Mapesa Manyasa


 


Appellant




and




Awinja Omuganda Sara


 


Respondent







        
          ((Being an appeal from the Ruling of Hon. G.Ollimo delivered on 17th June 2021 in Butere chief Magistrate’s court Succession cause No. 49 of 2010))
        
      






Judgment










1.
On 17/8/2020 the Respondent herein filed summons before the trial court ,seeking for revocation of the certificate of confirmation of grant issued to the appellant in respect to the Estate of Barnabas Mapesa Eshitemi (Deceased). The respondent also sought for issuance of a new certificate which makes a provision of her share in the Deceased’s Estate.






2.
In a ruling delivered 17/6/2021, the court revoked the certificate of confirmation of grant and directed any of the parties in the suit to apply for fresh summons for confirmation of grant. The court further directed that all the beneficiaries should have equal shares. It is the said ruling that has given rise to this Appeal.
Memorandum of appeal






3.
The appellant has set out the following grounds:
1.
That the trial magistrate crossly erred in failing to make a finding that the respondent herein lacked the requisite capacity to agitate any claim on behalf of the estate of one Tito Mukabane Mapesa
2.
That the learned trail magistrate grossly erred in failing to consider that it is the appellant who redeemed the deceased estate by paying a loan to Agricultural Cooperation so as to save the estate of the deceased.
3.
That the learned trial judge grossly erred in pre-empting a fresh distribution of the deceased estate by making an order that all the beneficiaries be assigned equal shares even before such application for confirmation of grant has been made.
4.
That the learned trial magistrate exhibited actual bias against the appellant in the matter
5.
That the learned trial magistrate final orders are manifestly un-just to the appellant.






4.
The Appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions:






Appellant’s submissions


5.
It is the Appellant’s submissions that since the Respondent is not a child, but a grandchild, of the deceased, she lacked the capacity to object to the succession proceedings. In this regard the Appellant has relied on the case of Rajesh Pranjiva (2014) eKLR where it was held that a litigant is only clothed with locus standi upon obtaining a limited grant of an estate he or she seeks to represent.






6.
It is further submitted that the trial magistrate failed to consider that the Appellant paid off the loan owed to Agricultural Finance Corporation by the deceased , in an attempt to save the deceased’s land from being sold .






7.
The respondent was yet to file submissions as at the time of writing this judgment.








Summary of the Evidence


8.
In the supporting Affidavits to the Application for revocation of the grant, the respondent stated that she was the only child of the Mukabane Mapesa, the son to the deceased, that they used to reside on land parcel No Maromo/Inaya/742. (The suit property). She further stated that the deceased was survived by 6 sons and the deceased had sub-divided his land between the six. She was using her father portion of the land until he was stopped by the Appellant in the year 2016. She seeks the intervention of the court in seeking to reclaim her father’s share in the suit property.

In response, the Appellant stated that he was ready to make a provision for the Respondent. He however states that he settled the deceased’s debts owed to Agricultural Finance Corporation, and has met all administrative costs of the estate. He has attached receipts for repayment of the loan.






10.
Consequently, he further states, he has the right to have the entire suit property, but as a sign of good faith he is willing to allocate a portion to the Respondent.








Determination


11.
This is a first appeal and the mandate of this court is well settled. In the case of Gitobu Imanyara & 2 others -vs- Attorney General (2016) eKLR, the court of Appeal stated: “it is trite law, that this Court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below and that an appeal to this Court from a trial by the High Court is by way of retrial and the principles upon which this Court acts in such an appeal are well settled. Briefly put, they are that this court must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowances in this respect. See Selle and Another v Associated Motor Boat Company Limited and others [1968] EA 123 and Williamson Diamonds Ltd. V. Brown [1970] E.A.L.”






12.
I have perused the lower court proceedings ,the ruling of the same court, the memorandum of Appeal and the Appellant’s submissions . I have identified the following issues for determination:
1.
Whether the Respondent has the locus standi to bring these objection proceedings.
2.
Who should settled the liability of the Estate if any.
3.
Whether the certificate of certification of court should be set aside
Whether the Respondent has the locus standi to bring objection proceedings .






13.
It is not in dispute that the Respondent is a grandchild of the deceased and the child of Tito Mukabane Mapesa, the son of the deceased. Even though in the replying affidavit, the Appellant did acknowledge that the Respondent is entitled to claim for the Estate in place of her deceased’s father, in his submissions, he contends that she Respondent lacked the legal standing because she has not taken out Representation on behalf of her father’s estate.






14.
The next question then is whether the Respondent needed to have taken out a grant ad litem or full grant in order to benefit from her grandfather’s Estate.






15.
Section 41 of the 
law of Succession Act
 provides as follows: ""Where reference is made in this Act to the ""net intestate estate"", or the residue thereof, devolving upon a child or children, the property comprised therein shall be held in trust, in equal shares in the case of more than one child, for all or any of the children of the intestate who attain the age of eighteen years or who, being female, marry under that age, and for all or any of the issue of any child of the intestate who predecease him and who attain that age or so marry, in which case the issue shall take through degrees, in equal shares, the share which their parent would have taken had he not predeceased the intestate.”






16.
In Re Estate of Wahome Njoki Wakagato (2013) eKLR, Justice Musyoka held “indeed part V the grandchild have no right to inherit their grandparents who die intestate after 1
st
 July 1981. The argument is that such grand children should inherit from their own parents. This means that the grandchildren can only inherit from their grandparents indirectly through their own parents, the children of the deceased. The children inherit first and thereafter grandchildren inherit from the children. The only time grandchildren inherit directly from their grandparents is when the grandchildren’s own parents are dead. The grandchildren step into the shoes of their parents and take directly the share that ought to have gone to the said parents.”






17.
My understanding of section 41 of the 
Law of succession Act
 and Justice Musyoka’s finding in the above stated case is that, the right of inheritance by a grandchild of his parent’s share in the estate of grandparent flows from being a child of the child of the deceased. In other words , it is the relationship , and the fact of death of the grandchild’s parent ,that gives a grandchild the locus standi. Consequently it matters not whether or not the grandchild has taken out a grant of representation in respect of his or her own parent’s Estate at the point of seeking to claim a share in the grandparent’s Estate.






18.
The respondent herein did not therefore need to take out a grant of representation for her father’s Estate to entitle her to a share of her grandfather’s estate.








Whether the Appellant is a creditor to the Estate


19.
The Appellant claims that he paid off the loan owed to Agricultural Finance Corporation by the deceased so as to preserve the said property. Contrary to the finding of the trial court , there are receipts showing that indeed the Appellant did make some payments to the said lender. However the payment made was on behalf of the estate and consequently this was a liability to the estate. That being the case, then the Appellant ought to have reflected it in the list of liabilities , in his petition. A perusal of the petition shows that there were nil liabilities against the Estate. The onus was on the Appellant, as the petitioner, to reflect the liabilities in question. That was a duty placed on him by section 83 of the 
Law of succession Act
. He did not, and contrary to his assertion, he had no right to take over the entire land because of settling the said debt. If he had stated the liability, the estate would only have ought him to the extent of the alleged liability, but not necessarily the entire suit property.
Whether the certificate of confirmation of grant should be revoked.






20.
From the onset, I need to point out that the 
law of Succession Act
 makes no provision for revocation of certificate of confirmation of Grant. Section 76 of the Act, makes specific reference to annulment or revocation of grant but not a certificate of confirmation . In my view a certificate of confirmation can only be set aside, cancelled or reviewed. However in the light of Article 159(2)(a) of 
the constitution
 and the power bestowed on this court by Rule 73 of the probate and administration rules, I will ignore the technical defects and address the issue as I understand it, which is setting aside the certificate of confirmation of Grant.






21.
From the summons for “revocation” it is evident that the respondent was not challenging the appointment of the Appellant as the Administrator of the estate. Her only complaint is that she was left out of the distribution despite the fact her father, one of the deceased’s sons, had the right to inheritance. In short, she is claiming her father’s share.






22.
The Appellant readily admitted the Respondent’s entitlement to the Estate and undertook to give her the portion due to her. The Appellant however faults the trial court for preempting, the confirmation proceedings by going ahead to direct how the Estate should be distributed.






23.
I have perused the ruling of the trial Magistrate. While concluding her ruling, her final orders were as follows:
1).
The certificate of grant issued to Charles Mapesa Manyasa be revoked and the same be issued in the names of both Charles Mapesa Manyasa and Awinja Omukunda Sara Bukachi.
2).
Either the Applicant of the Respondent is at liberty to file fresh summons for confirmation in which the Applicant’s share is captured.
3).
All beneficiaries to be assigned equal shares.
4)
………
5)
.……….
6)
………..






22.
Firstly, as stated herein before, the trial court ought to have been setting aside the certificate and not revoking it. Secondly, having not revoked the grant there was no basis upon which the Respondent was being admitted as a Co- Administrator of the Estate. The Grant as well as the certificate must be consistent in as far as the particulars of administration go. By having a new administrator appointed at the point of confirmation, while leaving the grant of letters of Administration intact, the trial court introduced technical barriers to the implementation of the certificate of confirmation of Grant.






23.
Finally , having directed the petitioner to file fresh summons for confirmation then order no. 3, was uncalled for. I agree with the Appellant that the trial magistrate, pre-empted the outcome of the intended summons.






24.
In view of the aforegoing and in exercise of the authority given to this court by Article 159(2) of 
the constitution
 Rule 73 of the 
law of Succession Act
, I hereby proceed to make the following orders:
a.
That the Ruling of the trial court is hereby set aside
b.
The orders of confirmation of Grant made on 15
th
 October are hereby set aside and the certificate of confirmation issued on 15
th
 October 2010 is hereby cancelled.
c.
Any sub-division that has been carried out affecting title no.Marama / Isaya/ 742 done in pursuance of the certificate of confirmation of Grant issued on 15
th
 October 2010 is hereby nullified and land registrar , Kakamega county is hereby directed to cancel all subdivision emanating from the above stated Title and reinstate the ownership of the land to the name of the deceased.
d.
The Appellant to file fresh summons for confirmation of Grant not later than 30 days from the date of this judgment, in which the mode of distribution must include the Respondent’s share in the Estate.
e.
This matter will be mentioned on a date to be given at the date of this Ruling to confirm compliance with the above stated directions.

Rivastage Company Limited


 


Appellant




and




Commissioner Of Domestic Taxes


 


Respondent










Judgment










1.
The Appellant is a limited liability company based in Nakuru dealing in wholesale and retail business.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya (KRA Act). Under Section 5 (1) of the Act, KRA is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue. For the performance of its function under Subsection (1), the Authority is mandated under Section 5(2) of the Act to administer and enforce all provisions of the written laws as set out in Parts I and II of the First Schedule to the KRA Act to assess, collect, and account for all revenues under those laws.






3.
The Respondent assessed the Appellant's tax returns and raised an assessment notice vide a letter dated 8
th
 May 2023.






4.
That the assessments were based on a return review exercise by the Respondent which established that the taxpayer had made vatable purchases but had not withheld VAT since its appointment as a Withholding VAT agent.






5.
On 22
nd
 June 2023, 23
rd
 June 2023 and 24
th
 June 2023, the Appellant lodged objection applications against the assessments mentioned above and the Respondent issued an Objection decision on 11
th
 July 2023 confirming the assessments.






6.
The Appellant subsequently lodged its Notice of Appeal filed on 22
nd
 July 2023.






The Appeal


7.
The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal filed on 21
st
 August 2023 which raised the following grounds: -
a.
The Withholding VAT Taxes 2% assessed were erroneous as they were not deducted from the suppliers of goods contrary to the assumption of the Respondent. The full amount was paid to the suppliers as evidenced from the invoices.
b.
The Respondent never examined the relevant supplier's document to end up with the additional assessed withholding VAT Taxes of 2%. The Appellant did not deduct 2% VAT from the goods supplied. If the documents and invoices were examined, the Respondent would have realized the Appellant never withheld the taxes presumed and it would be excessive to claim the same VAT of 16% fully paid to the suppliers. The Respondent in its due diligence examination would realize there were no Withholding Certificates for the claims by the suppliers. The VAT Act CAP 476, Withholding Tax Regulations stipulate ""any person withholding tax shall issue a Withholding Certificate to the withholdee"" and this was not interrogated for both the seller and the buyer. When a taxpayer (trader) supplies and invoices an appointed Withholding Agent the payment of the supply is made less VAT charged or that which ought to have been charged. The Agent withholds VAT irrespective of whether the supplier is registered for VAT or not. The Agent issues a Withholding VAT Certificate to the supplier indicating the VAT Withheld. This Certificate entitles the trader to claim back the withheld VAT to avoid double taxation since the same tax is declared and paid by the trader through a VAT3 Return. The process of verification and processing the claim (additional assessment) must, in the words of Article 47(1) of 
the Constitution
, be efficient and expeditious.
c.
The Appellant was appointed as a Withholding Tax Agent without his involvement, engagement, and knowledge. The Respondent under normal circumstances was duty bound to train the Appellant on the way of operating such a new tax obligation added without its knowledge. Lack of inclusivity in its appointment created a dilemma situation leading to the Appellant to be penalized without proper explanation.
d.
The Appellant in normal circumstances, if it had been appointed correctly through an all-inclusive process and deliberately failed to withhold the VAT 2% the sanction or penalty would be Kshs. 10,000.00 or 10% of the tax due whichever is higher. The approach taken by the Respondent is inaccurate and wrong as the whole 16% VAT taxes have been paid by the suppliers. By 
Act No. 4 of 2004
 the amendments to Section 35(6) gave the Commissioner power to ""impose such penalty as may, from time to time, be prescribed under the rules"". Rule 14A has prescribed the penalty for failure to deduct or remit withholding tax for the purposes of Section 35(6).








Appellant’s Case


8.
The Appellant’s case is also premised on the following documents filed before the Tribunal:
a.
Statement of Facts dated 13
th
 July 2023 and filed on 21
st
 August 2023.
b.
Written Submissions dated 10
th
 April 2024 and filed on 11
th
 April 2024.






9.
The Appellant stated that from its consideration of the tax records relating to this dispute it is factual that the Withholding VAT 2% taxes assessed were erroneous as they were not deducted from the suppliers of goods contrary to the assumption of the Respondent. That the full amount was paid to the suppliers. That for the withholding taxes to be due from the withholding agent there has to be proof the agent has withheld the 2% Withholding taxes.






10.
The Appellant argued that to form a conclusive assessment of the 2% Withholding VAT procedure to be followed as per the VAT Act Cap 476 and the TPA the examinable documents are suppliers’ invoices and Withholding certificates. That the Respondent never examined the relevant Appellant’s and supplier's documents to form a correct decision on the additional assessed withholding VAT taxes.






11.
The Appellant also argued that it was appointed as an Agent without its involvement engagement and knowledge and therefore was not well versed on how to conduct itself in the circumstances.






12.
The Appellant submitted that the normal sanction or penalty for VAT withholding taxes is Kshs. 10,000.00 or 10% of tax due whichever is higher. That the Appellant never withheld taxes and therefore there were no withholding taxes due to be penalized.








Appellant’s prayers.


13.
The Appellant prayed to the Tribunal to allow the appeal.








Respondent’s Case


14.
In response to the Appeal the Respondent presented its:
a.
Statement of Facts dated 12
th
 October 2023 and filed on 13
th
 October 2023 together with the documents attached thereto.
b.
Written submissions dated 15
th
 April 2024 and filed on 16
th
 April 2024.






15.
The Respondent stated that he is allowed by Section 24(2) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to assess a taxpayer's liability using any information available to him. That on the basis of this he operated within the confines of the law by using the data available following a return review.






16.
The Respondent averred that the additional assessment raised was based on the current assessment issued by the Respondent and hence no double assessments. That further the Respondent did not err in law or fact in confirming the assessment due to lack of supporting documentation.






17.
On the issue that the Appellant was appointed as a Withholding tax agent without its knowledge, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant was appointed as a Withholding VAT agent on 22
nd
 April 2021 and was notified through its itax- registered mail.






18.
The Respondent further submitted that the appointment was as per the provisions of Section 42A of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and added that the Appellant has for over two (2) years never opposed the appointment and only raised the issue after assessment for failure to withhold tax.






19.
On the issue raised by the Appellant that the penalty is beyond the statutory penalty, the Respondent referred to Section 39A of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and added that as per the provision, in case of failure by a Withholding VAT agent to deduct the 2%, the Respondent is empowered to demand the tax not deducted from the agent as if it was due from the withholding agent.






20.
The Respondent further relied on Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 to state that the burden is always on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.






21.
The Respondent in support of its case relied on the holdings in KRA vs Man Diesel &Turbo Se, Kenya [2021] eKLR, 
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes vs Structural International Kenya Ltd [Income Tax Appeal No. E089 of 2020
]KEHC 152 (KLR) and Digital Box Ltd vs Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement [TAT No.115 of 2017 amongst Others.








Respondent’s prayers


22.
The Respondent prayed that the Tribunal:
a.
Upholds Respondent's Objection decision dated 11
th
 July 2023.
b.
Dismisses the Appeal with costs to the Respondent as the same is devoid of merit.








Issues For Determination


23.
The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the parties, and considers the issues for determination to be as follows:
a.
Whether the appeal is valid.
b.
Whether the Respondent’s assessments against the Appellant were justified.








Analysis And Findings


24.
The Tribunal upon ascertaining the issues falling for its consideration proceeds to analyze the same as hereunder.
a.
Whether the Appeal is valid.






25.
The Appellant upon being dissatisfied with the Objection decision dated 11
th
 July 2023 filed its Notice of Appeal on 22
nd
 July 2023.






26.
The Tribunal notes that the procedure for appeal as set out in Section 13 (1) (b) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
 (TAT Act) requires that a notice of appeal shall be submitted to the Tribunal within thirty days upon receipt of the decision of the Commissioner.






27.
Consequently, the Appellant is required to abide by the provisions of Section 13 (2) of the Tat Act which provides as follows:
“
The Appellant shall within fourteen days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, submit enough copies, as maybe advised by the Tribunal of –
a.
memorandum of appeal
b.
…………………….”






28.
The Tribunal observed that the Appellant upon filing its Notice of Appeal on 22
nd
 July 2023 was as per Section 13 (2) TAT Act was expected to file its Memorandum of Appeal within fourteen days thereafter. The Appellant filed its Memorandum of Appeal on 21
st
 August 2023 well outside the requisite time.






29.
The Tribunal further noted that the Appellant failed to apply for leave to file its Memorandum of Appeal out of time as required by Section 13(3) of the TAT Act which provides as follows:
“
The Tribunal may, upon application in writing or through electronic means, extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and for submitting the documents referred to in subsection (2).”






30.
The Tribunal is of the considered view that the timelines for appealing the Commissioner’s decisions are clearly set out in the law and taxpayers are liable to comply with the same.






31.
The Tribunal reiterates its holding in the case of W.E.C. Lines Ltd vs. The 
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [TAT Case No.247 of 2020
] where it was held at paragraph 70 while reiterating the holding in Krystalline Salt Ltd vs KRA [2019] eKLR that: -
“
Where there is a clear procedure for redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed. Accordingly, the special procedure provided by any law must be strictly adhered to since there are good reasons for such special procedures. The relevant procedure here is the process of opposing an assessment by the Commissioner.”






32.
The Tribunal is also guided on the adherence to timelines by the case of 
Eastleigh Mall Limited v Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement (Income Tax Appeal E068 of 2020
) [2023] KEHC 20000 (KLR) where the court held: -
“
... Parliament in its wisdom knew that in matters tax, time is very crucial as those in commerce need to make informed decisions. If the Commissioner is allowed to exercise his discretion and stay ad-infinitum before issuing an objection decision, the taxpayer would be unable to make crucial decisions and plan his/her business properly. The timelines set are mandatory and not a procedural technicality.”






33.
Based on the statutory law and the case laws cited above, the Tribunal finds that there is no valid Appeal before it as the Memorandum of Appeal in the matter was filed out of time and without leave of the Tribunal. In the circumstances the Tribunal did not delve into the other issue set out for determination as the same was rendered moot.








Final Decision


34.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Appeal fails and the Tribunal accordingly proceeds to make the following orders:
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby struck out.
b.
Each party to bear its own costs.






35.
It is so ordered.

Background


1.
The Appellant is a resident individual taxpayer.






2.
The Respondent is a principal officer appointed under Section 13 of the 
Kenya Revenue Authority Act
, Cap 469 Laws of Kenya (KRA Act). Under Section 5 (1) of the Act, KRA is an agency of the Government for the collection and receipt of all revenue. For the performance of its function under Subsection (1), the Authority is mandated under Section 5(2) of the Act to administer and enforce all provisions of the written laws as set out in Parts I and II of the First Schedule to the KRA Act to assess, collect, and account for all revenues under those laws.






3.
In a letter dated 19
th
 August 2021, the Respondent informed the Appellant that it had determined the amounts of bank deposits in her accounts in the years 2016 to 2020, and assessed tax on the amounts.






4.
The Respondent then issued the Appellant with income tax assessments for the years 2017 to 2020 on 16
th
 December 2021.






5.
The Respondent subsequently issued the Appellant with a tax demand dated 5
th
 April 2022, and the Appellant filed a notice of objection on 8
th
 April 2022.






6.
On 25
th
 April 2022, the Respondent informed the Appellant that her objection was invalid and requested for supporting documents to aid in validating the objection.






7.
To validate her objection, the Appellant presented documentation for review by the Respondent on 4
th
 May 2022.






8.
Following further correspondence between the Appellant and the Respondent, on 27
th
 June 2022, the Respondent requested the Appellant to furnish it with a proper notice of objection as per the provisions of Section 51(3) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






9.
In response to the Respondent’s request, the Appellant furnished the Respondent with a notice of objection on 28
th

10.
The Respondent issued the Appellant with an objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 confirming the taxes as due and payable.






11.
Dissatisfied with the Respondent’s objection decision, the Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal on 2
nd
 February 2023.








The Appeal


12.
The Appeal is premised on the Memorandum of Appeal dated 1
st
 February 2023 and filed on 2
nd
 February 2023 which raised the following grounds:-
a.
That the Appellant gave an explanation and supporting evidence that the Respondent relied on creditors’ transactions or money deposits in the Appellant’s bank accounts to ascertain her taxable income, thus excessively overstating her tax liabilities.
b.
That the documents and explanations the Appellant provided were sufficient to determine the correct taxable income and tax liabilities.
c.
That the Respondent’s assertion that due to failure to avail material documents to attest to the actual business income it was forced to resort to alternative sources of information, that is, bank statements, is incorrect, and grossly unjust as its resulted to punitive and grossly overstated tax liabilities.
d.
That the Appellant provided a list of creditors and commissions earned which reconciled with the bank statements.
e.
That the Respondent’s decision to ignore the explanation of the nature of the Appellant’s business and supporting evidences and averment that the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate commission broker is arbitrary, unreasonable and oppressive.
f.
That the Respondent’s assertions that lack of information to attest to actual business income forced the Respondent to resort to alternative sources of information is untrue, unfair and unjustified.








Appellant’s Case


13.
The Appellant’s case is premised on the following documents filed before the Tribunal: -
a.
The Appellant’s Statement of Facts dated 1
st
 of February 2023 and filed on 2
nd
 February 2023 and the documents attached to it;
b.
The Appellant’s written submissions dated and filed on 11
th
 October 2023.






14.
The Appellant stated that as per the Respondent’s letter dated 19
th
 August 2021, the Respondent wished to collect income tax and VAT plus penalties and interest based on the Appellant’s bank deposits.






15.
The Appellant further stated that on 30
th
 August 2021, she applied for income tax return amendments for the years 2016 to 2020, and that the same was approved and resultant taxes, interest and penalties paid.






16.
The Appellant averred that on 16
th
 December 2021, the Respondent posted grossly overstated additional assessments for the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 contrary to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, disregarding and misunderstanding the nature of her business and the information on her business income in the amended self-assessments and supporting documents.






17.
The Appellant stated that she received a demand letter on 5
th
 April 2022, which she objected to on 8
th
 April 2022.






18.
That on 25
th
 April 2022, the Respondent responded to the objection by requesting for supporting documents to validate the objection. The Appellant averred that on 4
th
 May 2022, she provided a list of documents to validate the objection.






19.
The Appellant stated that the Respondent issued a decision on 17
th
 August 2022 confirming the additional assessments.






20.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred in law and fact by relying on creditors’ transactions or money deposited into her bank accounts at Equity Bank. She maintained that she acted as an intermediary for buyers and sellers and that she would make payments on their behalf through the bank accounts upon receipt of goods.






21.
The Appellant further averred that the Respondent did not undertake the verification of the amended self-assessments to ensure the Commissioner’s best judgement before issuance of the additional assessments as required under Section 31(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






22.
The Appellant averred that the Respondent erred in law and fact by imposing VAT since the nature of her business does not involve buying and selling, which was explained through documents supplied during the objection.






23.
The Appellant submitted that the Respondent’s investigation should provide details of the commodity/stock/item description being traded or sold that result from the large sum of money received to enable the Honourable Tribunal disregard the fact stated by the Appellant that her nature of business is brokerage and the money banked is creditors’ funds. She supported her submission by referring to the case of Raghubar Mandal Harihar Mandal Vs State of Bihar (1957) & STC 770,778 (SC), where it was stated thus: -
“
No doubt it true that when the return and books of accounts are rejected, the assessing officer must make an estimate and to that extent he must make a guess but the estimate must be related to some evidence or material and must be something more than mere suspicion.”






24.
The Appellant referred to the case of Hole Vs the Queen, 2016 TCC55 to challenge the bank deposit analysis method of assessment. The Appellant also cited the case Nairobi TAT No. 25 of 2016, Family Signature Limited Vs Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement on whether the Respondent was justified in employing an alternative and indirect method of assessing the Appellant’s tax liability. In that case, the Tribunal held that:-
“
When the respondent is prompted to result to an alternative method of determining income and in assessing the tax liability of a taxpayer, it has the onerous responsibility to act responsibly by exercising best judgement informed by pragmatic and reasonable consideration that do not in any manner result to ridiculously high-income margin.”








Appellant’s prayers


25.
The Appellant prayed the following from the Tribunal: -
a.
That the impugned decision contained in the Commissioner of Investigation and Enforcement objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 plus all consequential orders thereupon be reviewed and set aside ex-debito justitiae.
b.
That the Tribunal finds that the assessments KRA202122766880, KRA202122767233, KRA202122774384, KRA202122774502 for years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are excessive, unfair, and contrary to the provisions of the 
Income Tax Act
.
c.
That Honourable Tribunal finds that the forced registration of VAT obligation and assessments of VAT is contrary to Section 5 of VAT Act.
d.
That the costs of this Appeal be borne by the Respondent herein.








Respondent’s Case


26.
The Respondent’s case is premised on the following documents:
a.
Its Statement of Facts dated and filed on 21
st
 February 2023 and the documents attached to it; and
b.
Its written submissions dated and filed on 28
th
 September 2023.






27.
The Respondent stated that the dispute arose after it conducted investigations which involved the analysis of credits into the Appellant’s bank accounts, with a view to establish the taxable income and taxes payable after netting off the self-assessed amounts for tax purposes.






28.
The Respondent further stated that the Appellant registered for income tax obligation on 3
rd
 March 2005 but filed nil returns for this obligation in the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.






29.
The Respondent averred that besides verifiable information from its databases, it also relied on information provided by third parties such as banks, open-source intelligence and the National Transport Safety Authority’s Transport Information Management System, which according to the Respondent, it deemed as accurate.






30.
The Respondent stated that it analysed the Appellant’s bank accounts at Equity Bank and established that the Appellant received a total of Kshs. 111,040,016.00 during the period under review but failed to declare the income.






31.
The Respondent communicated to the Appellant vide a letter dated 19
th
 August 2021 about taxes payable established from the bank analysis.






32.
The Respondent then issued the Appellant with income tax assessments for the years 2017 to 2020 on 16
th
 December 2021.






33.
The Respondent subsequently issued the Appellant with a tax demand dated 5
th
 April 2022 which the Appellant objected to on 8
th
 April 2022.






34.
That on 25
th
 April 2022, the Respondent informed the Appellant that her objection was invalid and requested for supporting documents to aid in validating the objection.






35.
The Respondent stated that on 4
th
 May 2022, the Appellant presented documentation for review by the Respondent with a bid to validate her objection.






36.
That after reviewing the documents presented, the Respondent issued the Appellant with an objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 confirming the principal tax liability of Kshs. 55,078,408.00 as due and payable.






37.
The Appellant filed an Appeal at the Tribunal dated 2
nd
 February 2023 being dissatisfied with the Respondent’s objection decision.






38.
The Respondent summarised its issues for determination by the Tribunal as follows:
a.
Whether the Respondent was proper in law by relying on the Appellant’s bank accounts to raise assessments.
b.
Whether the Respondent’s charge to tax on the Appellant is justified.
c.
Whether there is a proper Appeal before this Tribunal.








a. On whether the Respondent was proper in law by relying on the Appellant’s bank accounts to raise assessments.


39.
The Respondent stated that it was rendered with no alternative other than to resort to additional sources of information such as the Appellant’s bank records to ascertain the actual taxes due and payable by the Appellant.






40.
The Respondent further stated that it conducted the banking analysis test which is based on the premise that money received must either be deposited or spent.






41.
The Respondent asserted that the Appellant only provided schedules purporting to show amounts received from clients, creditor funds and vendor payments. That since the Appellant did not provide sufficient documentation, she did not support the assertion that she was involved in brokerage and that the monies in the bank did not constitute sales, therefore the Respondent treated the unexplained deposits in the bank statements as taxable income and computed taxes pursuant to Section 29 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






42.
The Respondent relied on the holding in Hole v. The Queen, 2016TCC 55 where the Court stated that: -
“
There are two primary ways in which a taxpayer can challenge a bank deposit analysis. The first is to prove that his or her records were adequate and thus that his or her income should have been determined using those records. The second, and more common, method is to challenge the actual determination of income made by the Minister under the bank deposit analysis.”






43.
In support of its case, the Respondent referred to the case of Nairobi TAT No. 25 of 2016, Family Signature Limited vs. The Commissioner of Investigations and Enforcement, where one of the issues for determination was whether the Respondent was justified in employing an alternative and indirect method of assessing the Appellant’s estimated tax liability. That the Tribunal held that: -
“
47.
When the Respondent is prompted to resort to an alternative method of determining the income and in assessing the tax liability of a taxpayer, it has the onerous responsibility to act reasonably by exercising best judgement informed by pragmatic and reasonable considerations that do not in any manner result in a ridiculously high-income margin.”
“The Respondent's foregoing mandate was well captured by the apt observations in Raghubar Mandal Harihar Mandal V. State of Bihar 19521 8 STC 770,778 (SC), a case under the Bihar Sales Tax Act where it was stated thus:
“No doubt it is true that when the returns and the books of account are rejected, the assessing officer must make an estimate, and to that extent he must make a guess; but the estimate must be related to some evidence or material and it must be something more than mere suspicion.”
The Appellant had the onus to demonstrate that the deposits in its bank accounts did not entirely constitute its business income by providing credible information on the sources of the amounts of the deposits and this was well captured in the decision of A. Govoindarajulu Mudaliar V. Commissioner of Hyderabad 1958-LL-0924 when Venkatrama Ayiar, J. stated as follows:
""There is ample authority for the position that where an assesses fails to prove satisfactorily the source and nature of certain amount of cash received during the accounting year, the income tax officer is entitled to draw the interference that the receipts are of an assessable nature."" It does not appear that any serious attempt was made by the Appellant to demonstrate that the bank deposits in issue were not income and hence exempt from tax.”






44.
The Respondent submitted that it was therefore justified in applying the banking analysis method to determine the income earned by the Appellant during the period under review, as the Appellant failed to discharge the burden placed on her by the law to prove that not all the money in the account was income from her businesses.








b. On whether the Respondent’s charge to tax on the Appellant is justified.


45.
The Respondent averred that upon conducting conclusive investigations, it established that the Appellant had met the threshold to be registered for VAT under Section 5 of the 
Value Added Tax Act
.






46.
The Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not comply with the requirement to maintain records pursuant to Section 23 of 
Tax Procedures Act
, which provides that a person shall maintain any documents required under a tax law so as to enable a person’s tax liability to be readily ascertained.






47.
The Respondent issued a tax demand to the Appellant upon establishing that the Appellant registered for income tax but filed nil returns for this obligation in the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and failed to file any returns for the years 2015 and 2016.






48.
The Respondent invalidated the Appellant’s objection to the tax demand on the grounds that the Appellant did not support the same as required under Section 51(4) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
.






49.
The Respondent submitted that whereas Section 24 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 allows a taxpayer to submit tax returns in the approved form and manner prescribed by the Respondent, the Respondent is not bound by the information provided therein and can assess for additional taxes based on any other available information.






50.
The Respondent submitted that in the United States case of Holland V United States 121(1954), the Supreme Court held: -
“
…to protect the revenue from those who do not render true accounts, the Government must be free to use all legal evidence available to it in determining whether the taxpayer's books and records accurately reflect his financial history"" and that the indirect method used need not be exact, but must be reasonable in the light of surrounding facts and circumstances.”






51.
It was the Respondent’s case that it was justified in issuing the assessment based on the supporting documents provided by the Appellant, information available to it and based on its best judgement.






52.
In submitting that the Respondent applied its best judgment, the Respondent made reference to the decision in TC/2017/02292 Saima Khalid Appellant vs the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs Respondents.






53.
From the foregoing, the Respondent submitted that the assessment issued on 17
th
 August 2022 was justified, based on information available to the Respondent and was made based on the Commissioner’s best judgement.








c. Whether there is a proper Appeal before this Tribunal.


54.
The Respondent submitted that there is no proper Appeal before this Honorable Tribunal for determination as the Appeal herein was filed out of time without the leave of the Tribunal contrary to the provisions of Section 13(3) and (4) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
.






55.
The Respondent argued that in the Appeal herein, the Respondent issued its decision vide letter dated 17
th
 August 2022 of which the Appellant herein had 30 days to lodge an appeal at the Tribunal if she was dissatisfied with the same. That the Appellant filed the Appeal at the Tax Appeal Tribunal on 2
nd
 February 2023 which is a delay of over 5 months.






56.
The Respondent submitted that where there is a laid down procedure as well as set timelines for performing an action under legislation, those affected by the respective legislation have to adhere to the same at all times without default, failure to which the law will not come to their rescue. In so submitting, the Respondent referred to the holdings in the following cases: -
a.
Speaker of the National Assembly v James Njenga Karume |1992| eKLR
b.
TAT Appeal 254 of 2021 Salva Global Investment Co. Limited Vs. Commissioner of Domestic Taxes.








Respondent’s prayers


57.
The Respondent prayed that:
a.
The Appeal be dismissed for lack of merit.
b.
The objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 be upheld.








Issues for Determination


58.
The Tribunal has considered the facts of the matter and the submissions made by the parties and is of the view that the issues calling for its determination are as follows:
a.
Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal.
b.
Whether the Respondent was justified in issuing its objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022.








Analysis and Findings


59.
The Tribunal will proceed to analyse the issues that call for its determination as hereunder.








a. Whether there is a valid Appeal before the Tribunal.


60.
The Respondent submitted that there is no proper Appeal before this Honorable Tribunal for determination as the Appeal herein was filed out of time without the leave of the Tribunal contrary to the provisions of Section 13(3) and (4) of the 
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act
.






61.
The record of Appeal at the Tribunal shows that on 11
th
 October 2023, the Appellant filed an application seeking leave of the Tribunal to lodge its Notice of Appeal and the Appeal out of time.






62.
On 22
nd
 March 2024, the Tribunal granted the Appellant leave to file its Notice of Appeal and the Appeal out of time.






63.
Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that this Appeal is validly lodged.








b. Whether the Respondent was justified in issuing its objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022.


64.
The Respondent investigated the tax affairs of the Appellant for the period between 2015 and 2020 resulting in a letter dated 19
th
 August 2021 in which the Respondent informed the Appellant that it had determined the amounts of bank deposits in her accounts in the years 2016 to 2020, and assessed tax on the amounts.






65.
The Appellant and Respondent exchanged correspondences that led to the Appellant submitting to the Respondent a notice of objection on 28
th
 June 2022, which the Respondent validated and subsequently issued an objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 confirming the taxes as due and payable.






66.
Dissatisfied with the Respondent’s objection decision, the Appellant appealed the decision to the Tribunal.






67.
In arguing its case, the Appellant averred that the Respondent posted grossly overstated additional assessments for the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 contrary to Section 31 of the 
Tax Procedures Act
, disregarding and misunderstanding the nature of her business and the information on her business income in the amended self-assessments and supporting documents.






68.
The Appellant contested the Respondent’s application of banking analysis in assessing additional tax. The Respondent, on the other hand, stated that it was rendered with no alternative other than to resort to additional sources of information such as the Appellant’s bank records so as to ascertain the actual taxes due and payable by the Appellant considering that the Appellant filed nil returns for this obligation in the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.






69.
The Respondent asserted that the Appellant only provided schedules purporting to show amounts received from clients, creditor funds and vendor payments. That since the Appellant did not provide sufficient documentation, she did not support the assertion that she was involved in brokerage and that the monies in the bank did not constitute sales, therefore the Respondent treated the unexplained deposits in the bank statements as taxable income and computed taxes.






70.
The key issue in the present case is the question of documentation to substantiate the transactions in the Appellant’s bank accounts. The Appellant contended that she provided the Respondent with documentation and information on the nature of her business and business income in support of her case, which the Respondent allegedly disregarded and misunderstood.






71.
Conversely, the Respondent argued that the objection decision was based on information available to the Respondent.






72.
Section 56(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 and Section 30 of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) Act place the burden of disproving the Commissioner upon the taxpayer. To satisfy this burden, a taxpayer ought to submit all the relevant evidentiary material in its possession.






73.
The Tribunal refers to the case of 
Commissioner of Domestic Taxes v Trical and Hard Limited (Tax Appeal E146 of 2020
) [2022] KEHC 9927 (KLR) where the Court held at paragraph 
26
 that: -
“
From the above, it is clear that the evidential burden of proof rests with the taxpayer to disprove the Commissioner and that once competent and relevant evidence is produced, then this burden now shifts to the Commissioner. I have emphasized and underlined ‘competence’ and ‘relevance’ because it is only evidence that meets these two tests that demolishes presumption of correctness and swings the burden to the Commissioner. This means that even if one avails evidence but then it is found that the same is incompetent or irrelevant, then the burden continues to remain with the taxpayer.”






74.
The Tribunal made a similar observation in Tax Appeal Number 25 of 2021 Mugo Macharia Kigo v Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement wherein it stated that a taxpayer with an assessment arrived at based on an indirect method where information is secured from alternative sources is enjoined to provide the necessary documents and information that suggest that such an assessment is erroneous, misplaced and not justified in the circumstances.






75.
In the absence of relevant documentation to facilitate in the assessment of a tax liability, the Respondent is empowered under Sections 29(1) and 31(1) of 
Tax Procedures Act
 to use its best judgement in making its tax assessment.






76.
The Appellant raised issue with the Respondent’s resort to analysis of her bank accounts in the assessment of tax. The Tribunal has held before that exercise of best judgement includes use of bank deposit analysis in TAT Appeal No. 115 of 2017 Digital Box Limited 2017 Vs Commissioner of Investigations & Enforcement where the Tribunal stated as follows: -
“
Further the courts have in the past held that the banking analysis test (also known as bank deposit analysis) is an acceptable method of arriving at an assessment. This was held to be so in the case of Bachmann v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 51 where the court stated that: -
""This court has recognized that in an appropriate case a bank deposit appropriate case a bank deposit analysis is an acceptable method to compute income."" Once it is established that the method is allowed, the question is whether the method was applied in arriving at a reasonable assessment in the case at hand. The Tribunal is guided by the test set out in CA McCourtie LON/92/191 where it was stated: - ""In addition to the conclusions drawn by Woolf Jin Van Boeckel earlier tribunal decisions identified three further propositions of relevance in determining whether an assessment is reasonable. These are, first that the facts should be objectively gathered and intelligently interpreted; secondly. that any calculations should be arithmetically sound; and finally, that any sampling technique should be representative and free from bias.”






77.
The Tribunal finds that the Appellant has not proven that the use of bank deposit analysis is against the law and that when the Respondent used it, the Respondent arrived at an unreasonable assessment which lacked objectivity or was arithmetically wrong or biased.






78.
The Tribunal notes that the Appellant only presented to the Tribunal the financial statements for the years 2016 to 2020 for consideration in this Appeal. Although the Respondent stated that the Appellant had furnished it with schedules purporting to show amounts received from clients, creditor funds and vendor payments during its review of the Appellant’s objection, the Appellant did not provide these documents to the Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal, therefore, considered the only documents that the Appellant furnished in the Appeal to establish if they were sufficient to persuade a reasonable person that the Respondent’s assessment of the Appellant’s tax liabilities was erroneous.






79.
Section 54A(1) of the 
Income Tax Act
 which provides that: -
“
A person carrying on a business shall keep records of all receipts and expenses, goods purchased and sold and accounts, books, deeds, contracts and vouchers which in the opinion of the Commissioner, are adequate for the purpose of computing tax.”
envisions that a person carrying on a business must keep certain records and documents which in the opinion of the Commissioner are adequate for computing tax. The Appellant, however, did not produce these records and documents for the Tribunal’s review.






80.
Section 23(1) of the 
Tax Procedures Act
 also provides that a taxpayer is required to keep records as follows: -
“
A person shall—
(a)
maintain any document required under a tax law, in either of the official languages;
(b)
maintain any document required under a tax law so as to enable the person's tax liability to be readily ascertained; and
(c)
subject to subsection (3), retain the document for a period of five years from the end of the reporting period to which it relates or such shorter period as may be specified in a tax law.”






81.
The Tribunal’s review of the evidence presented by the Appellant in the Appeal revealed that the Appellant failed to adduce source documents including bank statements, bank reconciliations, brokerage agreements, commission statements, sales invoices, purchase invoices, freight documents, customs documents in case of importations of goods, her general ledgers, and other relevant records to support her allegations that her source of income was brokerage and earning commissions on local and imports market survey and facilitation, and that the cash deposits in her bank accounts were not income.






82.
Additionally, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant failed to provide a plausible explanation for the discrepancies between the income she disclosed and the cash deposits in her bank accounts, inspite of the law expressly placing a burden on her as a taxpayer to prove her case.






83.
The Appellant further admitted in an email to the Respondent dated 4
th
 May 2022, that she relies on bank statements and auditor interviews and fair judgement in preparation of her financial statements due to the nature of her business and accounting and tax capacity related challenges, such as, incomplete records and absence of financial accounting internal control systems.






84.
Due to the Appellant’s failure to provide critical transactional documents in support of her bank deposits, the Tribunal was unable to determine the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements provided by the Appellant as evidence.






85.
The Appellant asserted that the Respondent erred in law and fact by imposing VAT since the nature of her business does not involve buying and selling, which was explained through documents supplied during the objection. Conversely, the Respondent averred that upon conducting conclusive investigations, it established that the Appellant had met the threshold to be registered for VAT under Section 5 of the 
Value Added Tax Act
.






86.
In its consideration of the Appellant’s assertion, the Tribunal considered the provisions of the VAT Act with regard to charge of VAT and VAT Registration.






87.
Section 5(1) of the VAT Act states as thus: -
“
A tax, to be known as value added tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act on—
(a)
a taxable supply made by a registered person in Kenya;
(b)
the importation of taxable goods; and
(c)
a supply of imported taxable services.”






88.
Section 34 of the VAT Act provides that: -
“
(1)
A person who in the course of a business—
(a)
has made taxable supplies or expects to make taxable supplies, the value of which is five million shillings or more in any period of twelve months; or
(b)
is about to commence making taxable supplies the value of which is reasonably expected to exceed five million shillings in any period of twelve months,
shall be liable for registration under this Act and shall, within thirty days of becoming so liable, apply to the Commissioner for registration in the prescribed form:
Provided that a person supplying imported digital services over the internet, an electronic network or through a digital marketplace shall register whether or not the taxable supplies meet the turnover threshold of five million shillings.
(2)
In determining whether a person exceeds the registration threshold for a period, the value of the following taxable supplies shall be excluded—
(a)
a taxable supply of a capital asset of the person; and
(b)
a taxable supply made solely as a consequence of the person selling the whole or a part of the person’s business or permanently ceasing to carry on the person’s business.
(3)
...
(4)
...
(5)
The Commissioner shall issue a registered person with a tax registration certificate in the prescribed form.
(6)
If the Commissioner is satisfied that a person eligible to apply for registration has not done so within the time limit specified in subsection (1), the Commissioner shall register the person.
(7)
The registration of a person under subsection (1) or (6) shall take effect from the beginning of the first tax period after the person is required to apply for registration, or such later period as may be specified in the person’s tax registration certificate.”






89.
From the above, the Tribunal notes that the Appellant’s nature of business, which the Appellant described in its email to the Respondent dated 4
th
 May 2022 as brokerage and earning commissions on local and imports market survey and facilitation, is not expressly listed as an exempt supply under the First Schedule to the VAT Act. In addition, the Appellant failed to prove that its supplies were exempted from VAT. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant made taxable supplies in the period of assessment.






90.
Having determined that the Appellant made taxable supplies of a value of more than five million shillings in periods of twelve months throughout the period of assessment, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was justified in registering the Appellant for VAT in the period of assessment as the Appellant was liable to register for VAT under Section 34 of the VAT Act.






91.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Appellant did not discharge its burden of proof to demonstrate that the Respondent’s additional assessments of income tax and VAT for the periods 2016 to 2020 were incorrect or excessive as required under Section 56(1) of the TPA and Section 30 of the TAT Act.






92.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was justified in issuing the objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022.








FINAL DECISION


93.
The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that the Tribunal finds that the Appeal lacks merit and accordingly proceeds to make the following orders:-
a.
The Appeal be and is hereby dismissed.
b.
The Respondent’s objection decision dated 17
th
 August 2022 be and is hereby upheld.
c.
Each party to bear its own costs.






94.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The applicant in this matter was charged before the Chief Magistrate Court Makadara in Traffic Case No. E 4026 of 2024. The charge read: “failing to comply with Terms and conditions for Transport of special loads as provided for under the Permit Contrary to Section 20 (c) of the East African Community Vehicle Load Control (Special Loads) Act as read with Section 21 (1) of the East African Community Vehicle Load Control Act 2016.”
He was convicted on his own plea of guilty.






2.
The learned Honourable Magistrate sentenced him to a fine of Ksh. 3,000 USD and in default one (1) year imprisonment.






3.
It is against that decision that he has filed Criminal Appeal No. E 116 of 2024.






Analysis


4.
By way of a Notice of Motion dated 25
th
 August 2024, the applicant seeks bail pending appeal.






5.
It is his contention that the plea of guilty was equivocal since the prosecutor did not present the facts of the matter to the court and as such he was prejudiced.






6.
According to the applicant he was not warned by the court of the severity of the sentence that the offence would attract thus in admitting the offence he was not sufficiently informed to enable him make a conscious decision as to the nature of plea to enter.






7.
The applicant maintains that the failure by the magistrate to allow him to mitigate further denied him the opportunity to plead for a lenient sentence contrary to the law.






8.
The applicant through Ms Gaita Advocate argues that his appeal has overwhelming chances of success and he should therefore be granted bail pending the hearing of the Appeal.






9.
In support of her arguments Ms Gaita has cited the cases of Pandya Vs, Republic [1957] EA 336 and Francis Karioko Muruatetu v Rep [2021] eKLR on the need to exercise diligence at the time of recording a guilty plea and the need for courts to ensure that due process is accorded to all accused persons in the course of trial since the right to a fair trial is non derogable under Article 25 and 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






10.
Mr. Chebii for the state relied on his grounds of opposition and urged the court to find that the plea of guilty was unequivocal and thus the conviction and sentence was proper.






11.
Mr. Chebii submitted further that the decision on whether or not to grant bail pending appeal is discretionary thus he left the matter to court.






12.
He also argued that there were no special circumstances to warrant grant of bail pending Appeal.






13.
The importance of recording a plea of guilty with a great measure of caution need not to be emphasized.






14.
A court must be satisfied that the accused understands the charge and the attendant consequences to pleading guilty to the same.






15.
The record before the lower court in this matter is a single page in what appears to be a template.






16.
Upon perusal of the same I note that the record indicates that the prosecutor informed the court that “Facts as per charge sheet”.






17.
It is not indicated whether the facts nn the charge sheet were read to the Applicant.






18.
All that the record indicates is a tick by the court against the words:-
“
Accused - They are correct.”






19.
Whereas one may understand that the court due to pressure of work may adopt simplified methods of ensuring that matters proceed expeditiously, the trial court must know that in the deployment of such simplified system of conducting trials, the court must protect the accused’s right to a fair trial.






20.
The right to a fair trial must never be sacrificed at the altar of convenience.






21.
In determining the present application this court is guided by the case of Jivraj Shah V. Republic [1986] KLR 605 which laid down the principles in granting bail pending appeal as follows;-
a.
The principal consideration in an application for bond pending appeal is the existence of except exceptional or unusual circumstances upon which the court of Appeal can fairly conclude that it is in the interest of justice to grant bail.
b.
If it appears prima facie from the totality of the circumstances that the appeal is likely to be successful on account of some substantial point of law to be argued and that the sentence or substantial part of it will have been served by the time the appeal is heard, conditions for granting bail exists.
c.
The main criteria is that there is no difference between overwhelming chances of success and a set of circumstances which disclose substantial merit in the Appeal which could result in the appeal being allowed and the proper approach is the consideration of the particular circumstances and weight and relevance of the points to be argued”.






22.
I have considered the arguments by counsel for both parties and I must say the applicant’s application meets the test for the grant of bail pending appeal.






23.
In my view, the summary nature of the trial rendered it susceptible to review an appeal. The Legal issues raised as to the regularity of the procedure adopted by the court, are weighty and the appeal therefore has overwhelming chances of success.






24.
It is an appeal that emanates from a process that by all standards cannot be said to have met the requirements of a fair trial.






25.
To state “facts as per charge sheet” is to presume the accused knows the facts set out in the charge sheet.






26.
It is not the business of a trial court to presume matters. Facts must be read out and explained to an accused person in a language he understands and the actual words used by the accused in response thereto captured.






27.
The trial court must ensure that an accused person fully understands what offence he faces and the sentence that he is likely to suffer.






28.
The accused must be explained the facts in sufficient detail more so where the language used by the accused is different from the language used in the body of the charge sheet.






29.
The record in this matter reads:-
“
Interpretation English/Kiswahili”. It therefore follows that the accused would have required the facts in the charge sheet to be read out in Kiswahili.""






30.
The record does not reflect that, thus the court cannot assume that indeed the facts were read and explained in Kiswahili.








Determination


32.
In the end I find and hold that the applicant’s application for Bail pending appeal has merit. The same is hereby allowed.






33.
The applicant shall be released from custody on a Bond of Ksh. 150,000/= plus 1 surety of similar amount or an alternative Cash Bail of Ksh. 50,000/=.
It is so ordered.

Environment & Land Case 124 of 1997

          )
        
      






Ruling










1.
Bikhabhai Mathurbhai Patel, Dr. Frank Kamundi Mwongera and Cyprian Iburi Ngaruro, the applicants herein, have brought a Notice of Motion dated 1
st
 November, 2019 seeking orders that this appeal being Civil Appeal No. 281 of 2018 filed by Maccu Motors Limited, the respondent, be struck out with costs to the applicants.






2.
The application is premised on the grounds that the Notice of Appeal dated 6
th
 June 2019 was lodged on 7
th
 June 2019 and that the Appeal herein was filed on 22
nd
 October 2019 which was outside the sixty (60) days stipulated under Rule 84(1) of this Court’s Rules. In addition, the applicants contend that the respondent failed to serve them with the letter it wrote to the Deputy Registrar requesting for the typed proceedings and the judgment of the Environment and Land Court (ELC), and as such it is not entitled to rely on the certificate of delay.






3.
The respondent opposed the Motion through a replying affidavit sworn by Fredrick Mburugu, a director of the respondent. He contends that it is true that the Notice of Appeal was lodged at the ELC on 7
th
 June 2019 and that the sixty (60) days started running on 22
nd
 August 2019 when the proceedings were obtained and that the time of preparing and typing of proceedings is excluded from computation of the sixty (60) days period. He contends that the Certificate of Delay was obtained pursuant to section 79G of the 
Civil Procedure Act
.






4.
The respondent further contends that the appeal was filed timeously and that indeed the letter seeking typed proceedings was served upon the applicants.






5.
At the plenary hearing of the application on 11
th
 December 2023, learned counsel Mr. J.M. Mwangi appeared for the applicants while Mr. Ondari appeared for the respondent. Both counsel adopted their respective written submissions and made brief oral highlights.






6.
Counsel for the applicants submitted that the Record of Appeal dated 22
nd
 October, 2019 filed by the respondent, was filed in contravention of Rules 84 (1) and (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules as the letter bespeaking typed proceedings was not served on the applicants’ counsel. Counsel emphasised that the record was filed outside the sixty (60) days prescribed by the Court of Appeal Rules, and as the letter in question was not served on them, the respondent is precluded from relying on the proviso to Rule 84 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The applicants, therefore, urge the Court to strike out the Appeal.






7.
In response, counsel for the respondent submitted that the Record of Appeal filed on 22
nd
 October 2019 was filed within time because the days taken to type the proceedings are excluded from the sixty (60).days referred to in Rule 84 (supra). Mr. Ondari though claiming that the letter bespeaking the proceedings was served on counsel for the applicants, did not avail any evidence to that effect. Instead, he entreated the Court to invoke Article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
 and treat the said non-compliance as mere technicality and dismiss this application.






8.
Having considered the application, the grounds in support of the application, the rival affidavits, the cited authorities, the submissions of both counsel and the law, the only issue for determination is whether the applicants have satisfied the requirements for striking out the Record of Appeal.






9.
The application is pegged on the former Rules 82, 83 and 84 of the Court of Appeal Rules. We start by observing that the Record of Appeal which the applicants want struck out was filed on 22
nd
 October, 2019. This application was filed on 1
st
 November 2019, or thereabouts and it was, therefore, in compliance with the current Rule 86 of the Court of Appeal Rules which requires such an application to be filed within 30 days of service of the said record.






10.
Rule 84(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules is explicit and bears no repeating for purposes of this ruling, more so, because it is not contested here. The Record of Appeal must be filed within sixty






60.
days after the filing of the Notice of Appeal. The framers of the rules were nonetheless cognizant of the fact that for reasons beyond an intending appellant’s control delays can occur, particularly in the typing of proceedings. A window was created to allow parties who are unable to get the proceedings on time still access justice, hence the proviso to that rule. The proviso is not burdensome at all and all it requires is for a party who has filed a Notice of Appeal to copy and serve the other party with the letter sent to the registrar requesting to be supplied with copies of the proceedings. It is imperative that the said letter be copied and served on the respondent within thirty (30) days of the filing of the Notice of Appeal. It is not an innocuous technicality that can be cured by Article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
. It is anchored on the Court of Appeal Rules and commands its compliance. If that simple act is done, then the appellant can sit and wait for the proceedings to be prepared and when ready and availed to the appellant along with a certificate of delay, then the sixty (60) days start running.






11.
There was no evidence placed before the Court to confirm that the letter requesting for the proceedings was copied and served on the applicants. If indeed such a letter existed, it would have been attached to the replying affidavit. The respondents should have invoked the relevant rules and applied for extension of time to enable them to comply. As the matter stands now, the record of appeal was filed out of time and without the leave of the Court. The same is for striking out.






12.
Accordingly, this application is allowed and the Record of Appeal dated 22
nd
 October 2019 is struck out with costs to the applicants.






13.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an Appeal from the Decree and Judgment of the Environment and Land Court of Kenya at Meru (M. Njoroge, J.) dated 29th August 2018 in ELC Petition No. 28 of 2013)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Land parcel No. 1417 (the suit property) located within Kitharene Adjudication Section was registered in favour of Limberia Kirera. On 26
th
 March 1994 the 1
st
 respondent M’Mugaine M’Naingabu filed Objection No. 647 against Limberia Kirera claiming 1.50 acres of the suit property. The objection went before the Land Adjudication Officer Tigania, East/West District (the 2
nd
 respondent) for resolution. On 21
st
 April 1998 the parties appeared before the 2
nd
 respondent. Limberia Kirera had shown the 1
st
 respondent one acre of land at Nguthuine Area unregistered in compensation for the claimed    land. The 1
st
 respondent withdrew his objection and the objection was marked as dismissed with the suit property remaining with Limberia Kibera.






2.
Following a letter dated 11
th
 February 2006 to the 2
nd
 respondent, Limberia Kirera gave the suit property to his wife Karuta Mberia (the 1
st
 appellant) and his daughter Fridah Kambaja Mberia (the 2
nd
 appellant) in equal shares. The register was amended to reflect this. The new parcels were 1417 (to the 1
st
 appellant) and 3241 (to the 2
nd
 appellant).






3.
The 1
st
 respondent went back to the 2
nd
 respondent and filed Objection No. 649 against Limberia Kirera claiming 1.50 acres of the suit property. His case was that he was re-opening his objection that had been compromised and/or dismissed on 21
st
 April 1998. The parties were heard and the 1
st
 respondent’s claim of 1.50 acres of the suit property was allowed on 11
th
 February 2008.






4.
Limberia Kirera died on 9
th
 May 2008. He is the one referred to as the deceased in the proceedings.






5.
When the decision in Objection No. 649 was not effected, the 1
st
 respondent filed a constitutional petition before the Environment and Land Court at Meru claiming that his constitutional right to the 1.50 acres had been violated. He sought a declaration that he had been deprived of the land and    an order that the decision in the objection be implemented. The appellants opposed the petition, contending that Objection No 649 and the subsequent proceedings were a nullity, the dispute having been heard and determined in Objection No. 647. According to the 2
nd
 respondent, the decision in Objection No. 647 superseded that in Objection No. 649; that the deceased was no longer the owner of the suit property, it having been registered in the names of the appellants. This is the dispute that was heard by the learned M. Njoroge, J. and determined on 29
th
 August 2018.






6.
The learned Judge declared that as long as the 2
nd
 respondent had not implemented the decision in Objection No. 649 and given the 1
st
 respondent the 1.50 acres, the constitutional right of the latter to the land had been violated. The learned Judge observed as follows:-
“
As long as that decision stands I think that it is not the task of this court to consider whether there was any other decision made there before concerning the suit land. Furthermore it appears that the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents, being the persons entitled to the 2
nd
 respondents, being the persons entitled to the second parcel of land that the deceased would get at Nguthaine when demarcation began, would unfairly benefit from the acquisition of the deceased’s second portion while the petitioner would go without any land. If the petitioner had already been given land from the new adjudication section as was intended in the objection proceedings, then there would not      have been anything easier than for the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents to expressly say so in their replies. That however was not done and, in my thinking, putting an end to this dispute without any remedy being accorded to the petitioner would leave the petitioner quite disadvantaged.”






7.
To put it briefly, the learned Judge found that, because the deceased’s undertaking in Objection No. 647 to give the 1
st
 respondent one acre in Nguthuine was not honoured, the 1
st
 respondent was entitled to receive his claim through Objection No. 649 to get 1.50 acres of the suit property as had earlier been claimed; that when the 2
nd
 respondent failed to implement the decision in Objection No.649 he violated the 1
st
 respondent’s constitutional right to the land in question.






8.
The appellants were aggrieved by the decision, and came before this Court on appeal. Their grounds were as follows:-
“
1)
That the learned Judge erred by failing to find that the 1
st
 respondent’s objection no. 649 against parcel no. 1417 Kitharene Adjudication section, was heard and determined on 21/4/1998.
2)
That the learned Judge erred by failing to find that under the 
Land Adjudication Act
, there is no provision for a re-hearing of an objection since the only redress after a hearing is an appeal to the minister or to file a judicial review suit to quash such decision or to file a judicial review application for an order of mandamus.


1.
That the appellants have been deprived of their lawful properties through an improper and illegal determination dated 11/2/2008.






2.
That the trial court erred in completely ignoring the findings of the end respondent dated 21/4/1998 and thus resulted into taking away the appellants’ lands.






3.
That once the 1
st
 respondent herein confirmed that he had been shown his one (1) acre by the deceased before withdrawing his objection, then the only remedy available to the 1
st
 respondent was to follow his one acre as shown and not to revive an objection that had been already determined.”


The appellants asked that their appeal be allowed, the petition before the trial court be dismissed, and that they be awarded the costs of the appeal.






9.
During the hearing of this appeal. Learned counsel Mr. Kaburu represented the appellants. He had filed written submissions which he highlighted. The 1
st
 respondent was served, but neither attended nor filed submissions. Learned counsel Mr. Njeru appeared for the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents. The 3
rd
 respondent is the Attorney General. He did not file submissions.






10.
It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that once the dispute between the 1
st
 respondent and the deceased over the suit property was heard and determined by the 2
nd
 respondent through Objection No. 647, there was no jurisdiction on the part of the 2
nd
 respondent to re-open or re-hear the same dispute    between the parties in Objection No. 649. Citing the decision in Samwel Kamau Macharia & Another -vs- Kenya Commercial Bank & 2 Others [2012]eKLR, learned counsel Mr. Kaburu submitted that both under the 
Land Adjudication Act
 (Cap. 284) and 
Land Consolidation Act
 (Cap. 283) the 2
nd
 respondent’s jurisdiction to hear and determine the objection filed in Objection No. 647 became exhausted when the claim was compromised through agreement for the deceased to compensate the 1
st
 respondent with one acre in Nguthuine. The 1
st
 respondent could not bring the same dispute, now contained in Objection No. 649, making the same claim; that if he was not given the one acre in Nguthuine he ought to have sued the deceased to recover the same. It was submitted that the proceedings contained in Objection No. 649 were a nullity for want of jurisdiction, and therefore the learned Judge had fallen into error when he entertained the objection.






11.
We have reconsidered the evidence and material that was placed before the learned Judge. The learned counsel for the appellants had submitted before the learned Judge that, the decision of the 2
nd
 respondent in Objection No. 647 determined the rights of the deceased and the 1
st
 respondent in respect of the suit property; and the determination was final as the interests of the parties in the suit property had been ascertained. When the deceased failed to give the 1
st
 respondent the one acre that he had undertaken, that was a    claim to be filed in court but not the subject of a fresh objection. This was because the 
Land Adjudication Act
 and the 
Land Consolidation Act
 did not provide for the revival of the Objection No. 647.






12.
Quite unfortunately, we observe, the trial court did not deal with this question of jurisdiction. Once this question was raised, the learned Judge was obligated to determine it before delving into the merits of the claim. (See Owners of the Vessel “Lillian S”    -vs- Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989]eKLR). If the court found that it did not have jurisdiction it was bound to down its tools, as it were.






13.
It is our considered view that under sections 5 to 26 of the 
Land Consolidation Act
, a mechanism was provided to the 2
nd
 respondent to hear and determine any objections relating to ascertainment of rights in the suit property. Indeed, the 2
nd
 respondent heard the dispute. It was compromised on the basis that the deceased would retain the suit land and give the 1
st
 respondent alternative land in compensation in Nguthuine area unregistered. The one acre had been shown to the 1
st
 respondent. One does not know what became of the one acre, but from the proceedings the 1
st
 respondent did not get it. Whatever the case, his claim to the 1.50 acres was exhausted once he accepted a lesser parcel in compensation elsewhere. The legislations under which his claim in Objection No. 647 was heard and determined through the compromise did not provide    for the re-opening of  the matter. Any grievance, if at all, was reserved to be taken before the Minister on appeal.






14.
In other words, the proceedings in Objection No. 649 that sought to revive that 1
st
 respondent’s claim over the 1.50 acres of the suit land were a nullity for want of jurisdiction on the part of the 2
nd
 respondent. It follows that, in allowing the petition, the learned Judge fell into error as the suit was for dismissing.






15.
Consequently, we allow the appeal with costs and set aside judgment and decree by the learned Judge. In its place, there will be a judgment dismissing the petition with costs.

Between




Coley Njeru Bildad


 


Appellant




and




Rentwork East Africa Limited


 


Respondent







        
          ((Being an Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the High Court of Kenya at Chuka (L.W. Gitari, J.) dated 11th March 2021 in HCCA No. 30 OF 2019))
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant, Coley Njeru Bildad, was a passenger in motor vehicle registration number GKB 485H Toyota Land Cruiser which was beneficially owned by the respondent, Rentwork East Africa Limited. He was a teacher, a principal at Kathwana Secondary School, and was on duty on 14
th
 November 2016 when the vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident along Chuka – Meru Road. He suffered injuries.






2.
In a suit which the appellant filed at the Chief Magistrate’ Court at Chuka, he blamed the respondent of negligence and sought to be compensated in general and special damages. The respondent denied the claim. However, a consent on liability was entered into at 80:20% in favour of the appellant.






3.
The trial court received evidence during the proceedings and on 14
th
 August 2019 awarded Kshs.2,000,000.00 in general damages for pain, suffering, loss of amenities and future medical expenses, and nothing on special damages. When the consent was taken into account, Kshs.1,600,000.00 was awarded, together with costs and interest.






4.
The respondent was aggrieved by the judgment and decree and appealed to the High Court at Meru. The grounds were that the award of Kshs.2,000,000.00 was manifestly excessive, given that the appellant had a closed-head injury which was a soft tissue injury from which he had fully recovered. The respondent’s case was that the appellant was entitled to an award of Kshs.500,000.00 because the doctors were not able to assess the degree of any permanent injury, that there was no evidence that he developed any post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD) or that he was seeing a psychiatrist as had been indicated by the trial court. The appellant supported the award and argued that he had suffered life-threatening head injuries from which he had not recovered.






5.
The High Court (L.W. Gitari, J.) heard the appeal, and in a judgment delivered on 11
th
 March 2021, found that the general damages awarded were excessive and based on unproven information. This is what the learned Judge observed:-
“The award of damages is an exercise of judicial discretion which must be exercised judicially. In this case, the respective medical reports did not assign any degree of permanent disability. They all agree that the respondent sustained a closed-head injury and all tests returned a result that was normal. The respondent did not suffer loss of consciousness and has never sustained epileptic seizures. There was no material laid before the court showing that he continued with treatment. It follows that he recovered fully. I agree with the appellant’s counsel submission that the trial magistrate took into account an irrelevant fact that was also not proved. The award was not based on any evidence.”
The learned Judge awarded Kshs.600,000.00 in general damages. When 20% liability on the part of the appellant was considered, the award was Ksh.480,000.00.






6.
The appellant was aggrieved and appealed to this Court. He listed the following grounds:-
“
1)
That the learned judge erred in law and facts in assessing general damages at Kshs. 600,000/= which amount was excessively low in the circumstances in light of the fact that even the respondent’s Doctor Stephen Maina acknowledged the kind of injuries the appellant sustained amounted to permanent disability.
2.
That the learned judge erred in law and facts for failing to find that the appeal was incompetent for lack of certified copy of the decree.
3.
That the learned judge erred in law and facts by overruling clear authorities of this honorable court.”






7.
In this second appeal, our jurisdiction is limited to matters of law only. We can only interfere if it is demonstrated that the courts below considered matters, they should not have considered or failed to consider matters they should have considered, or looking at the entire decision, it is perverse. (See Maina -vs- Mugiria [1983] KLR 78). In Kenya Breweries Ltd -vs- Godfrey Odongo [2010]eKLR, this is what Onyango Otieno, JA. observed:-
“
In a first appeal the appellate court is by law enjoined to revisit the evidence that was before the trial court and analyse it, evaluate it and come to its own independent conclusion. In other words, a first appeal is by way of a retrial and facts must be revisited and analysed a fresh, - see Selle and Another vs. Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd and Others (1968) EA
123.
In a second appeal however, such as this one before us, we have to resist the temptation of delving into matters of facts. This Court, on second appeal, confines itself to matters of law unless it is shown that the two courts below considered matters they should not have considered or failed to consider matters they should have considered or looking at the entire decision, it is perverse.”






8.
Secondly, where a party is seeking to be compensated in general damages following a road traffic accident, and assuming that the question of liability has been determined, the compensation will be evaluated on the basis of the nature and extent of the injuries suffered and comparable awards made in the past for such or similar injuries. (See Simon Taveta -vs- Mercy Mutiru Njeru [2014]eKLR). An appellate court will not disturb an award of damages unless it is inordinately high or low as to represent an entirely erroneous estimate of the injuries suffered. (Bashir Ahmed Butt -vs- Uwais Ahmed Khan [1982 – 88) KAR 5).






9.
Mr. Kijaru, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the appeal before the High Court was incompetent for failure on the part of the respondent to attach a certified copy of the decree. We note that the issue of the competence of the appeal to the High Court was raised in the written submissions that had been filed by the appellant’s counsel. Our take is that if the appellant had seriously wanted to attack the appeal on its incompetence, he ought to have sought at a preliminary stage, to have it struck out. Nonetheless, when it was raised in the submissions, the learned Judge found, correctly in our view, that courts have since the enactment of sections 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and Article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
, moved away from the previous position that failure to attach a decree, even where there is a judgment, is a jurisdictional point that calls for the striking out of the appeal. (See Chege -vs- Suleiman [1988]eKLR). The current position is exemplified by this Court’s decision in Emmanuel Ngade Nyoka -vs- Kitheka Mutisya Ngata [2017]eKLR in which it was observed as follows:-
“We entirely agree with the reasoning of the learned Judge on this aspect. In any event, this was a mere technicality that could not have sat well with the current constitutional dispensation that calls upon courts to go for substantive justice as opposed to technicalities. Further holding otherwise would have run counter to the overriding objective as captured in sections 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
. Finally, one would ask what prejudice did the appellant suffer with the omission of the certified copy of the decree in the record of appeal. We do not discern any.”






10.
On the substance of the appeal, learned counsel submitted that the learned Judge erred by setting aside the award of Kshs.2,000,000.00; that there was medical evidence in support of the appellant’s claim on the injuries sustained as a result of the accident, and that at the time of the trial he had not fully recovered. Lastly, that the injuries were of a permanent nature.






11.
According to Mrs. Wachira, learned counsel for the respondent, the learned Judge was well-guided in awarding Kshs.600,000.00 to the appellant. This was because the appellant failed to prove that he had suffered PTSD; that the issue of PTSD was, in any case, not specifically proved and had only come up in the report of Dr. Wokabi dated 9
th
 January 2018. Further, that Dr. Wokabi had concluded that the appellant had recovered normally without any neurological or physical disorder. It was submitted that Dr. Wokabi had referred the appellant to a psychiatrist, but that such psychiatrist had not produced a report to say that there were any psychiatric complications that had been suffered.






12.
We note that the learned Judge was not of the same view as the trial court, which considered the injuries suffered to be serious and of having a permanent impact. The record showed that when the appellant filed his plaint dated 4
th
 October 2018, he particularized his injuries as:-
“
a)
face deviated to the right side due to facial palsy and also have a tearing of the left eye.
b.
head injuries;
c.
MRI; Leukoaraiosis of deep white matter to ischemic demyelination;
d.
EEG; normal awake and drowsy EEG.
The present complaints were:-
“
a)
frightening attacks;
b.
forgetfulness; Loss of memory;
c.
headache;
d.
stomach upset;
e.
small bang is eliciting mild tonic chronic jerks of the left lower limbs and both upper limb.
f.
interrupted conversation on and off trying to remember some of the things that he wants to say;
g.
epilepsy attacks.”
These injuries were based on the report by Dr. Stephen Maina Wambugu that was dated 30
th
 October 2017.






13.
However, the appellant was subsequently examined by Dr. Wokabi who did a report dated 9
th
 January 2018. According to him, all medical, clinical, CT scans and MRIs confirmed that the appellant had suffered, “closed head injuries”, and that all CT scans and MRI of the brain indicated that the appellant was “normal”. He had been treated but had continued to complain of regular severe headaches, generalized body spasm and generalized feeling of being unwell. However,
“
Repeat MRI’s, CT scans and brain tracings of EEGS were all reported as being normal. He was referred to psychiatrist, a psychologist and neurologist to asses and treat him.
After all these investigations no definite organic illness was detected”
He was finally diagnosed to have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTD) and was still undergoing treatment by a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Dr. Wokabi opined that patients with this disorder were expected to recover fully, and yet the appellant continued to complain. The Doctor was unable to put a number of his degree of permanent disability and indicated that the psychiatrist treating him could be best suited to access his degree of permanent disability.






14.
We note that, although evidence was led by the appellant regarding Dr. Wokabi’s report, his suit was based on Dr. Stephen Maina Wambugu’s report. Unfortunately, Dr. Wokabi’s report indicated that the appellant had fully recovered from his injuries, except for the PTSD complaint that the Doctor felt could fully recover unless the psychiatrist that the appellant was seeing said otherwise. There was no report by the psychiatrist. The trial court did not, as was found by the learned Judge, fully appreciate the medical evidence, and especially the opinion of Dr. Wokabi who examined the appellant subsequent to the examination by Dr. Stephen Maina Wambugu. It was also evident to the learned Judge, and we agree with her, that the issue of the appellant having suffered PTSD was not pleaded in the plaint, and yet it was the basis of the trial court’s finding that there was a permanent effect to the injuries that had been suffered following the accident.






15.
In short, having considered the judgment by the learned Judge, the grounds of appeal and the rival submissions, we do not find any merit in this appeal, which we dismiss with costs.

and

Interested Party










Judgment










A. Introduction And Background.


1.
The Appellant, Ivan Raphael Okisai is a student of the Respondent which is a State Corporation established under Section 3 of the 
Kenya School of Law Act
 2012 and the successor of the Kenya School of Law previously established under the Council of 
Legal Education Act
, 1995 (now repealed). Its mandate is inter-alia to train persons for purposes of the 
Advocates Act
 (Cap 16) for which it offers the Advocates Training Programme (“ATP”). The Interested Party, The Council Of Legal Education






2.
The Appellant states that after the release of the Project Work for the class of 2022-2023, he realized that he had not been awarded Project Work marks in 7 out of 9 units namely, ATP 100-Civil Litigation, ATP 101-Criminal Litigation, ATP 102-Probate and Administration, ATP 104-Trial Advocacy, ATP 105-Professional Ethics and Practice, ATP 106-Legal Practice Management, ATP 107-Conveyancing.






3.
Following this development, the Appellant applied to have his Project Work results reviewed, to which the Respondent responded by stating that the Appellant’s request could not be granted as he failed to participate in the Project Work as per the minutes and signing sheet.






4.
There was an exchange of correspondence between the Appellant and Respondent culminating in the decisions contained in the letters dated 1
st
 August 2023 and 6
th
 June 2024. The former letter relayed the decision that the minutes and the final Project Work report confirmed the Appellant’s non-participation in the Project Work. He was therefore encouraged to register to undertake the Project Work with the 2024 ATP cohort. The latter letter noted the Appellant’s non-payment of the fees required to undertake the Project Work with the 2024 ATP cohort and that the Appellant’s request to formalize his self-allocation of a firm was declined. He was urged to register for the 2025 ATP cohort.






5.
Being dissatisfied with the decisions of the Respondent, the Appellant filed his Memorandum of Appeal to this Tribunal dated 11
th
 July 2024. His Appeal to this Tribunal was accompanied by a Supporting Affidavit.






6.
The Appellant seeks several reliefs from this Tribunal including:
a.
A declaration that the actions and omissions of the Respondents are contrary to and inconsistent with Articles 10,73 and 232 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010;
b.
A declaration that the Respondents violated the Constitutional rights of the Appellant, particularly, Articles 27, 43, 47 and 48 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010;
c.
A declaration that the amount of fee demanded by the Respondent is excessive;
d.
An order to set aside and quash the decision of the Respondent denying the Appellant allocation of class and firm;
e.
An order directing the Respondent to award the marks for Class C Firm 31 of the Academic Year 2022-2023.
f.
An order directing the Respondent to issue the Appellant with the project Work assignment in the current academic year with strict timelines on completion and release of results;
g.
Costs of the Appeal






7.
The Appellant also relied on a Further Affidavit he swore on 27
th
 August 2024.






8.
The Respondent opposed the Appeal through its Replying Affidavit sworn by Fredrick Muhia on 15
th
 August 2024 in which it states that the Appellant failed to attend at least two thirds of the Project Work firm meetings in the 7 units and also failed to sign the signing sheet for the Project Work.






9.
The Interested Party associated itself with the pleadings and submissions of the Respondent in the matter.








B. The Appellant’s Appeal


10.
The Memorandum of Appeal sets out the following grounds:
a.
The Appellant noted that his Project Work results were missing for the 7 units mentioned above. He wrote to the Respondent on 27
th
 March 2023 seeking a review of his results. The Respondent responded on 13
th
 April 2023 stating that he was not awarded marks for failing to participate in Project Work.
b.
The Appellant states that he then perused the links for the meetings of his Firm and noted that there were discrepancies in the submitted links and that some evidencing attendance had not been included in the final Project Work report. He wrote to the Respondent on 14
th
 July 2023 and the Respondent informed him vide its letter of 1
st
 August 2023 that the links were not proof of participation.
c.
Thereafter, the Appellant through a letter of 1
st
 February 2024 applied to join the 2024 ATP cohort as directed by the Respondent. The Respondent approved this request vide its letter of 9
th
 February 2024 subject to the payment of Kshs. 15,000 per unit. The Appellant paid Kshs. 35,000 out of the required Kshs. 105,000.
d.
The Appellant sought to be allocated a class and firm which request was approved by the Respondent’s email of 21
st
 March 2024 and was requested to seek assistance for the academic services office to be allocated a class and firm.
e.
Upon follow up in June 2024, the Appellant was informed vide an email of 6
th
 June 2024 that his request to be allocated a class and firm had been declined and was advised to apply to join the 2025 ATP cohort.








C. The Respondent’s Reply


11.
In its Replying Affidavit, the Respondent states as follows;
a.
The Respondent’s mandate is, inter alia, to train persons for purposes of the 
Advocates Act
 (Cap 16) for which the Respondent offers the Advocates Training Program.
b.
Every ATP student is assigned a class and a firm for Project Work purposes which is offered in Term 1 and carried out in accordance with the Project Work Guidelines (the “Guidelines”).
c.
The minutes and the participation signing sheet for Class C firm 31 of the 2022-2023 ATP cohort showed that the Appellant had failed to attend at least two-thirds of the firm meetings as required by the Guidelines.
d.
The Appellant was therefore not qualified for awarding of Project Work marks and should retake the Project Work next offered.
e.
The payment of fees on 6
th
 August well after the deadline for Project Work excluded the Appellant from participating in Project Work with the 2024 ATP cohort.








D. The Parties’ Submissions


The Appellant’s Submissions:


12.
The Appellant was admitted to the Advocates Training Programme (ATP) at the Kenya School of Law in 2022 but faced issues with project submission and later class and firm allocation. The Appellant contends that despite paying Kshs. 35,000 to the Respondent and his persistent efforts to secure a class and firm allocation in 2023 and 2024, the Respondent failed to allocate him a class and firm, thereby violating his legitimate expectations and constitutional rights.






13.
The Appellant argues that the missing signature on his project was an honest mistake as his signature went to the spam folder of his firm leader and that the Respondent’s failure to verify the Project Work and provide timely communication compounded the procedural injustices he faced.






14.
The Appellant contends that the Respondent’s lack of response violated constitutional mandates for public officers to provide responsive, transparent, and timely services. He cites legal provisions and court decisions to support his claim for fair administrative action and argues that minor procedural errors should not invalidate substantive work.






15.
The Appellant states that he has provided evidence of his participation in the project work and seeks recognition of his efforts, rectification of procedural shortcomings, and allocation of a class and firm to complete his training. He believes he deserves the orders sought in the Memorandum of Appeal dated July 11, 2024.






16.
The Appellant submits that he engaged in constant correspondence with the Respondent to secure a class and firm allocation. He deposited Kshs. 35,000 on March 11, 2024, and informed the respondent’s officers but received no guidance. The Director responded via email on March 27, 2024, accepting the appellant’s application for a class and firm allocation. Despite this, he submits that the Respondent did not follow through with the allocation.






17.
The Appellant argues that the Respondent’s lack of response violated Articles 73 (e) and 232 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, which mandate public officers to provide responsive, transparent, and timely services. The Director’s directives should be followed unless they contravene the law. The appellant relies on Article 47 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, which mandates expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair administrative action. The respondent’s failure to provide written reasons for not admitting the Appellant violated these provisions.






18.
The Appellant cites the Court of Appeal decision in Judicial Service Commission v Mbalu Mutava & Another [2015] eKLR, emphasizing the importance of fair administrative action and national values such as the rule of law, human dignity, social justice, good governance, transparency, and accountability. He states that his application was accepted by the Director, but he was still not allocated a class and firm, hampering his quest to complete the Advocates Training Programme.






19.
The Appellant argues that the respondent’s failure to act on the Director’s directions, despite several reminders, further compounded the procedural injustices he faced. He prays that the annexures included in the appeal provide sufficient evidence to persuade this tribunal. He relies on Section 31 of the 
Legal Education Act
, 2012 which he states empowers this tribunal to consider any evidence that may not be admissible under the law of evidence.






20.
Additionally, that Section 35 of the 
Legal Education Act
, 2012, authorizes this tribunal to exercise any powers that the Council could have exercised in the proceedings related to the appeal.






21.
The appellant contends that the right to education under Article 43 (1) (f) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010, was violated due to the respondent’s failure to allocate him a firm and class. The appellant attended the project work discussions, and the missing signature on the final draft was an honest mistake due to human and technological challenges. Justice should be administered without undue regard to procedural technicalities.






22.
The Appellant states that he has demonstrated that he participated in the project work and that the missing signature was an honest mistake. That the Respondent’s failure to verify the project work, provide timely communication, and allocate a class and firm in 2024 violated the appellant’s legitimate expectations and constitutional rights.






23.
The appellant seeks a resolution that acknowledges his participation, addresses procedural shortcomings, and rectifies the unjust treatment he received. The Appellant merits being awarded marks for the project work done by Class C Firm 31 in the academic year 2022-2023 and should be allocated a class and firm to complete his training.






24.
The Appellant submits that he deserves the orders sought in the Memorandum of Appeal dated July 11, 2024.








The Respondent’s Submissions:


25.
The Respondent, in opposition to the Appeal submits that it is a State Corporation established under Section 3 of the 
Kenya School of Law Act
 Cap 16C, with a mandate to train persons for purposes of the 
Advocates Act
 (Cap 16) through the Advocates Training Programme (ATP). The ATP includes a mandatory project work component carried out in groups called “firms” with a minimum attendance requirement. The Respondent’s role is limited to setting questions, timelines, providing meeting links, and grading reports, without participating in the project work.






26.
The Respondent submits that the Appellant was a member of Class C Firm 31 (2022/2023 cohort) and failed to attend at least two-thirds of the firm meetings in several units, resulting in no marks awarded for those units. Specific details provided by the Respondent indicate that the Appellant attended only one meeting for ATP 100 Civil Litigation, zero meetings for ATP 101 Criminal Litigation, three meetings each for ATP 105 Professional Ethics and ATP 104 Trial Advocacy, two meetings for ATP 102 Probate and Administration, and zero meetings each for ATP 106 Legal Practice Management and ATP 107 Conveyancing. Specifically, the Respondent lists them as follows:
Specific Units and Attendance
a.
The Respondent provides specific details as follows:
b.
ATP 100 Civil Litigation: The Appellant attended 1 meeting, no marks awarded.
c.
ATP 101 Criminal Litigation: The Appellant attended 0 meetings, no marks awarded.
d.
ATP 105 Professional Ethics: The Appellant attended 3 meetings, no marks awarded.
e.
ATP 104 Trial Advocacy: The Appellant attended 3 meetings, no marks awarded.
f.
ATP 102 Probate and Administration: The Appellant attended 2 meetings, no marks awarded.
g.
ATP 106 Legal Practice Management: The Appellant attended 0 meetings, no marks awarded.
h.
ATP 107 Conveyancing: The Appellant attended 0 meetings, no marks awarded.






27.
The Respondent argues that attendance was recorded through meeting minutes signed by firm members, and the determination of the Appellant’s attendance was made by his fellow firm mates, binding the Respondent to their report. The Respondent identifies issues for determination, including whether the burden of proof has been met, whether the impugned decision was illegal, irrational, unreasonable, or procedurally unfair, and whether the Respondent’s actions were justified and anchored in law.






28.
The Respondent emphasizes the well-established rule of evidence that whoever asserts a fact is under an obligation to prove it. The Appellant, having made allegations in the appeal, is under an obligation to support those allegations with evidence. The Respondent cites Justice Mativo in Hellen Wangari Wangechi v Carumera Muthini Gathua [2005] eKLR, who quoted Lord Brandon in Rheir Shipping Co. SA. v Edmunds [1955] WLR 948 at 955, stating that deciding on the burden of proof is sometimes the only just course to take. Justice Mativo further stated that the legal burden of proof is the test applied when coming to a decision in any particular case, as succinctly put forth by Rajah JA in Britestone PTE Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East Ltd [2007] 4SLR ® 855 at 59.






29.
The Respondent asserts that whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist, as enshrined in Section 107 of the 
Evidence Act
. The standard of proof in civil cases is the balance of probabilities, as stated by Justice Mativo, citing Lord Denning in Miller v Minister of Pensions [1947] 2 ALL ER 372. The Respondent contends that it would have been easy for the Appellant to correct the alleged omissions or errors by producing statements on oath from firm members confirming his participation.






30.
Procedural impropriety is defined by the Respondent as the failure to act fairly in the decision-making process, including non-observance of the Rules of Natural Justice or procedural fairness. The Respondent argues that no evidence has been presented to show that it acted outside its legal mandate or improperly exercised its discretionary powers. It is an established principle that courts should not substitute their judgment for that of the agency.






31.
The Respondent cites John Wachiuri T/A Githakwa Graceland & Wandumbi Bar & 50 Others vs The County Government of Nyeri & Another, emphasizing three categories of public law wrongs: illegality, fairness, and irrationality and proportionality. Illegality occurs when decision makers fail to follow the law properly, fairness demands that public bodies act impartially and follow express procedures, and irrationality and proportionality require courts to quash decisions that are demonstrably unreasonable or perverse, as established in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd vs Wednesbury Corporation.






32.
The Respondent submits that the Court should not interfere with its decision simply because it holds a different view, as long as the decision is based on established guidelines. The power to review administrative actions is extraordinary and should be exercised sparingly, only in cases of proven illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The Respondent references Republic vs National Water Conservation & Pipeline Corporation & 11 Others, where it was held that judicial intervention is warranted only when there is evidence of illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety.






33.
Based on the above, the Respondent states that they have demonstrated that the appeal should be dismissed.










E. Analysis And Determination.


34.
The crux of the appeal relates to the administration of the Advocates Training Programme examinations component of the Project Work that constitutes 20% of the final Bar examination mark. The Project Work is undertaken by the students in a class being assigned by the respondent a cohort referred to as a firm. In this case the appellant who was undertaking the Advocates Training Programme during the 2022/23 academic year was in class C firm 31. The respondent declined to award the appellant the firm marks in 7 units on account of failure to meet the minimum attendance threshold of at least two-thirds of the firm meetings. The Respondent indicated that Project Work is undertaken under the Kenya School of Law Advocates Training Programme Project Work Guidelines, 2022. The conduct of firm meetings was provided for in section 5 of the Guidelines as follows;
“
(a)
A firm will undertake the project work by holding at least six firm meetings which shall be chaired by the firm leader. The meetings may either be virtual or physical.
(b)
A student must attend and participate in at least two – thirds of the firm meetings in order to be eligible for awarding of marks for the project work by the course instructor.”






35.
In this case, the course was undertaken via the virtual platform. The Respondent’s records of attendance tendered before the Tribunal compose of the minutes of the firm meeting attendance, the firm members signed attendance list and an indication of annextures of the dates, time and duration of attendance during the firm meetings in the 7 units. The Tribunal has reviewed the said evidence and finds that it fails short of section 5 (e) of the Guidelines which obligated the firm leader to submit the minutes and the platform generated attendance list where the meeting was virtual. The Respondent failed to place before the Tribunal the platform generated attendance list in their initial form as tendered by the firm leader to enable the Tribunal to juxtapose the same as against the Appellant’s submitted microsoft teams links showing his participation in the firm meetings. For the record of attendance to be complete and conclusive in this matter for purposes of section 19 (2) of the 
Kenya School of Law Act
, Cap. 16C the same has to be backed up by the platform generated lists.






36.
The Tribunal has also reviewed the evidence of the signing of the attendance lists and noted that the signatures of 2 of the firm members were also appended by way of pasting onto the list. The Appellant’s contention was that he had submitted his signature to the firm leader for the same to be affixed. The whatsapp conversations between the appellant and the firm leader well confirmed that the signature had been sent to his email but he claimed that he forgot to affix it as it was in his spam mail. The Tribunal finds that the conduct of the firm leader fell short of the diligence required in the discharge of his obligations to a firm member in this case being the appellant. The Appellant followed up to confirm from the firm leader if his signature had been affixed on the report only to be informed that the same had been submitted without his signature. The firm leader did not involve the Appellant in the decision to submit the report without his missing signature and also he did not submit the report to the Appellant to sign before submitting. The Kenya School of Law Student Information Handbook at page 23 provide for the firms Guidelines which provide;
“
Firm Leaders to acknowledge receipt of documents and emails so as to maintain clear lines of communication between Class Representatives and Firm Leaders on the aspect of disseminating relevant information to fellow colleagues.”






37.
In this matter, the failure of the firm leader to acknowledge the appellant’s signature as sent was in breach of the firm guidelines embodied in the Handbook.






38.
The Respondent has in it’s submissions contended that the Appellant ought to have gotten the firm leader to swear an affidavit to support his contention that he inadvertently omitted to affix his signature. The Tribunal finds that the matter was not raised in the response by the Respondent on oath and by it’s inclusion in the submissions it cannot act as a rebuttal to the Appellant’s depositions. Submissions cannot assume the place of evidence in a matter. The Tribunal is well fortified by the authority in Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi v Mwangi Stephen Muriithi & Another (2014) eKLR in which it was held;
“
Submissions cannot take the place of the evidence. The 1
st
 respondent failed to prove his claim by evidence. What appeared in submissions could not come to his aid. Such a course only militates against the law and we are unable to countenance it. Submissions are generally parties, marketing language; each side endeavoring to convince the court that its case is the better one. Submissions we reiterate, do not constitute evidence at all. Indeed there are many cases decided without hearing submissions but based only on evidence presented.”






39.
In the premises, the Tribunal set-aside the decision of the respondent in so far as it found that the appellant failed to participate in the firm’s meetings.






40.
The Tribunal is of the view that the matter herein may be resolved by remitting the scrutiny of the attendance issue for re-consideration by the Respondent who ought to avail to the appellant the platform generated lists for the attendance in issue and having regard to the dictates on fair administrative action reconsider the matter of his participation in the Project Work.






41.
The second aspect of the appeal relates to the handling of the Appellant’s application to redo the Project Work once again for the 7 units. He did vide a letter of the 1
st
 February 2024 apply to join the 2024 ATP cohort as directed by the Respondent. The Respondent approved this request vide it’s letter of 9
th
 February 2024 subject to the payment of Kshs. 15,000 per unit. The Appellant paid Kshs. 35,000 out of the required Kshs. 105,000. He sought to be allocated a firm which request was approved by the email of the 21
st
 March 2024 and was requested to seek assistance from the academic services office to be allocated a firm. In June 2024, the Appellant was informed vide an email of 6
th
 June 2024 that his request to be allocated a firm had been declined and was advised to apply to join the 2025 Advocates Training Programme cohort. The Tribunal finds that the handling of the application by the respondent was not undertaken in accordance with the dictates of fair administrative action. There was delay in acting on the application by the respondent coupled with unjustified inertia all of which ran a foul the constitutional command in article 47 (1) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 which ordains;
“
Every person has the right to administrative action that is expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair.”






42.
Emphasis was placed by the Respondent on 
fees payment as a prerequisite to the appellant’s registration being confirmed in breach of the regulations in place which made the same mandatory only when registering for the written examinations
. The Tribunal is well fortified that the precondition of full fees had a restricted application based on regulation 26 of the Kenya School of Law (Training) Regulations, 2015 which provided as follows;






43.
“(1) A student shall be eligible to register and sit for a written examination if the student—
(a)
has attended at least two-thirds of all the lectures offered in relation to that course unit; and
(b)
has paid all the fees in relation to that course unit….
(5)
For the purposes of this regulation ""written examination"" shall not include coursework or any other continuing assessment test.”






44.
Finally, the Tribunal once again as it has held in previous similar appeals implores upon the respondent and the interested party to formulate clear regulations to guide the conduct of the Project Work examination component. The guidelines formulated in this matter ought to be backed up or embodied in the Kenya School of Law (Training) Regulations, 2015 to avoid inconsistency. For instance a reading of regulations 26 (a) and (f) of the regulations appear to be in conflict with the guidelines on the two thirds attendance requirement. The same provide;






45.
“(1) A student shall be eligible to register and sit for a written examination if the student—
(a)
has attended at least two-thirds of all the lectures offered in relation to that course unit; and
(b)
has paid all the fees in relation to that course unit….
(5)
For the purposes of this regulation ""written examination"" shall not include coursework or any other continuing assessment test.”






46.
In Diana Kemunto Ogega v Kenya School of Law & Another (2020) eKLR the Tribunal held;
“
The Regulations have a lacuna on the mode of assessment for the Advocates Training Programme which should be cured through the formulation of Regulations on the same.”
1.
The same position was addressed Ian Wachira Ndegwa v Council of Legal Education & Kenya School of Law (2021) eKLR by the Tribunal as follows;
The Tribunal once again notes as it did in the case of Diana Kemunto 
Ogega v Kenya School Of Law & Council of Legal Education, LEAT Appeal No. 2 of 2020
 that the Regulations of the Interested Party do not provide for the assessment mode for the Advocates Training Programme unlike the Para – Legal and the Continuing Legal Education Programmes which are provided for in Regulations 16 and 21 of the Kenya School of Law (Training Programmes) Regulations, 2015 which provide;
‘16.
Assessment and issuance of certificate in the Paralegal Studies Programme
(1)
The School shall assess each course unit using coursework and a final written examination.
(2)
The Board of Directors shall determine the percentage to be allocated for each mode of assessment…
21.
Assessment under the Continuing Professional Development programme
The School shall determine the mode of assessment for each course offered under the Continuing Professional Development Programme.’
The Regulations have a lacuna on the mode of assessment for the Advocates Training Programme which should be cured through the making of the requisite Regulation.”

Ruling










1.
The application, dated 29
th
 February 2024, invites me to strike out the appeal herein, on grounds that the same is res judicata, as it was a replica of Busia HCCA No. 13 of 2020, which arose from the same judgment, and which was determined on 28
th
 July 2023.






2.
The respondent did not reply to the application.






3.
The appellant filed detailed written submissions, supported by authorities.






4.
I have perused the record. I have seen the memorandum of appeal filed in Busia HCCA No. 13 of 2020, and I have noted that that appeal and the present one arose from the same judgment, and the appellant is party to both appeals. I note further that the appeal in Busia HCCA No. 13 of 2020 was determined, on 28
th
 July 2020, when it was dismissed.






5.
Clearly, the appellant herein was prosecuting 2 appeals, albeit through different law firms, while challenging the same judgment. That is what abuse of court process is about. The instant appeal has become res judicata that in Busia HCCA No. 13 of 2020, and it is no longer tenable.






6.
Consequently, I hereby dismiss the appeal herein, with costs to the respondent. The file herein shall be closed.

Ruling










1.
The Tenant’s Application dated 13.5.2024 seeks orders that the Landlord’s notice to vacate be treated as null and void, that the Tribunal does enforce the terms of the lease agreement dated 24.1.2023 and that the Respondent be restrained from leasing out the demised premises to any third parties.






2.
The Tenant has sworn an affidavit in support of her Application wherein she has deponed that she entered into a lease agreement over Plot No. Muguga/Jetschem/4886/9 Kikuyu (the suit premises) on 24.1.2023.






3.
The Tenant depones in her said affidavit that she runs a bar in the name of Lucky Pub in the suit premises and she has been issued with a liquor license for the year 2024.






4.
The Tenant has further deponed that the Landlord has issued her with a notice to vacate and it is the view of the Tenant that the notice is issued in bad faith as the Tenant is not in any rent arrears.






5.
The Tenant also depones that the Landlord is using the area chief and ‘DC’ who have jointly threatened to evict the Tenant if she does not vacate as per the notice dated 3.04.2024.






6.
It is the deposition of the Tenant that the notice to vacate is aimed as defeating justice since the lease is still in force.






7.
The lease agreement annexed to the Tenant’s affidavit expresses the lease period/term to be a period of five (5) years at clause B(1)(i). The tenancy between the parties is a controlled tenancy as provided for or as defined under Section 2(1) of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya. Consequently, the relationship between the parties is governed by the provisions of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya and the Tribunal is well seized of this matter.






8.
The notice the Tenant seeks to have declared as null and void is the one dated 3.04.2024. I have read the said notice and do find it to be in compliance with the provisions of Section 4 of Cap 301 as far as termination notices are concerned. The notice is a valid notice, the service of which the Tenant acknowledges in her affidavit in support of her Application.






9.
In electing to challenge the notice to terminate tenancy under Section 4 of Cap 301 by the filing of a Complaint under Section 12(4) of Cap 301, the Tenant clearly ran afoul of Section 6(1) of Cap 301 which provides as follows;-
“
A receiving party who wishes to oppose a tenancy notice and who has notified the requesting party under Section 4(5) of this Act that he does not agree to comply with the tenancy notice, may before date upon which such notice is to take effect refer the matter to a Tribunal whereupon such notice shall be of no effect until and subject to the determination of the reference by the Tribunal.”






10.
The Tenant has not filed any Reference to the Tribunal in opposition to the notice to terminate tenancy. this ought to have been the proper procedure and I hold that the filing of the instant Application by the Tenant in opposing the notice validly issued under Section 4(2) of Cap 301 is improper and does not in any way affect the validity of the said notice.






11.
Consequently, I do not find any merits in the Tenant’s Application dated 13.5.2024 and the same is dismissed with costs to the Landlord.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
The Landlord’s Application dated 10.7.2024 seeks the following orders;
a.
That the Tribunal be pleased to grant declaratory orders finding that the Tenant has violated the conditions imposed on it pursuant to the provisions of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya.
b.
That the Tribunal be pleased to grant orders compelling the Tenant to settle rent arrears for the months of June, 2024 and July, 2024 to the 1
st
 Respondent.
c.
That the Tribunal be pleased to grant orders terminating the tenancy between the Tenant and the 1
st
 Respondent effective within thirty (30) days of the date of the orders.








The 1
st
 Respondent’s depositions


2.
The Affidavit of the 1
st
 Respondent in support of the Application may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That on 27.5.2024, the Tenant made a reference to the Tribunal challenging the levy of distress against it by the Respondents.
b.
That the Reference and the Application dated 27.5.2024 have been overtaken by events as the Tenant cleared the arrears and was reinstated to the suit premises.
c.
That the Tenant has not paid the rent for the month of June and July 2024.
d.
That the 1
st
 Respondent now finds herself hostage to a Tenant who is unwilling to pay rent in a timely manner and who engages the court in an attempt to delay this matter.
e.
That the delay has severally affected the 1
st
 Respondent’s ability to cater for her needs and the upkeep of her family.








The Tenant’s depositions


3.
The Tenant’s replying affidavit sworn on 17.7.2024 may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That it is true that the Tenant filed a Reference to the Tribunal.
b.
That at the time the Tenant filed the Reference, it had rent arrears but which arrears were cleared during the pendency of the Reference.
c.
That the Applicant did not file any response to the Tenant’s Application.
d.
That the rent for the month of May 2024 is in dispute and the Tenant is willing to clear the rent for the month of July 2024 before this matter is concluded.
e.
That the Tenant prays to be allowed to be paying its rent on or before the 28
th
 day of the month owing to the nature of its hotel business.
f.
That the landlord/Applicant has not issued the notice to terminate tenancy and the Tribunal can only issue orders to vacate from a premises upon an Application by a party through the prescribed form; consequently, the Landlord’s notice to the Tenant to vacate within thirty (30) days is defective and void.








Analysis and determination


4.
The only issue that arises for determination in this Application is whether the Landlord is entitled to the orders sought in her Application.






5.
It is commonly agreed that the Tenant’s Application dated 27.5.2024 has been overtaken by events for the reason that the Tenant paid all the outstanding rent arrears and was granted access to the suit premises.






6.
The Landlord in the instant Application has deponed that the rent for the months of June and July has not been paid while the Tenant’s position is that the rent for the month of May 2024 was not payable and therefore the only rent outstanding is that of July 2024. I have not found any concrete evidence indicating that the 1
st
 Respondent ever waived the rent for the month of May 2024 and which I now find payable. Consequently, the rent in arrears is that for the month of June and July 2024 as currently presented out by the 1
st
 Respondent. In the circumstances, the 1
st
 Respondent is entitled to levy distress for the rent arrears for the months of June and July 2024 and any other subsequent month that the rent remains unpaid. (See Section 3 of Cap 293, the 
distress for rent Act
).






7.
The 1
st
 Respondent has also sought an order terminating the tenancy between the parties effective thirty (30) days from the date of such order. I do not think this order is for granting. The Landlord is required under the provisions of Section 4(2) of the Act to issue a mandatory statutory notice to terminate tenancy in the absence of which the tenancy cannot be terminated. In this regard, the relevant Section of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya provides as follows;-
“
4
(1)
notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law or anything contained in the terms and conditions of a controlled tenancy, no such tenancy shall terminate or be terminated and no term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant of any such tenancy shall be altered otherwise than in accordance with the following provisions of this Act.”
“4
(2)
A landlord who wishes to terminate a controlled tenancy or to alter to the detriment of the tenant any term or condition in or right or service enjoyed by the tenant under such a tenancy shall give notice in that behalf to the tenant in the prescribed form.”






8.
The Applicant herein has not issued the aforesaid notice although Counsel for the Applicant/Landlord argues that Section 9(2)(b) of Cap 301 allows the courts to terminate tenancies as they deem fit. I do not think this is the correct position as Section 9(2)(b) of Cap 301 ought to be read together with the provisions of Section 4(1) and 4(2) of Cap 301 reproduced above. Further, Section 9(2)(b) of Cap 301 applies to instances where a Tribunal is making a determination of a Reference filed under the provisions of Section 6(1) of Cap 301. The Landlord in this case is not pursuing a Reference filed pursuant to a notice issued under Section 4(2) of Cap 301 and in the circumstances, the orders of termination sought are not available to the Landlord.






9.
The Tenant has sought orders that the Tribunal allows it to pay rent on the 28
th
 day of each month due to the nature of its hotel business. This order cannot be availed to the Tenant for the simplest of reasons that it does not form part of the Tenant’s Application and it would be prejudicial to the Landlord who has had no opportunity to respond to the same.
Further, it is an implied term of the tenancy between the parties that the Tenant ought to pay the rent for the premises in advance. I therefore do not find any merits in the prayer.








Disposition


10.
In view of the above findings, and in disposing of the Application, I make the following orders:-
a.
That the Tenant is in rent arrears for the months of June 2024 and July 2024.
b.
That the Tenant is to clear the said rent arrears within the next thirty (30) days failing which the Landlord will be at liberty to levy distress for rent using a licensed auctioneer.
c.
That the Landlord’s prayer for termination of the tenancy between the parties herein is declined.
d.
That the Tenant’s prayer to be allowed to pay rent on the 28
th
 day of each subsequent month is hereby declined.
e.
That the Tenant shall bear the costs of the Application.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
The Landlord’s Application dated 1.07.2024 seeks orders that the Tenant immediately vacates the suit premises and declares vacant possession thereof and pays the rent arrears in respect of the property known as Plot No. XIV/138 Kingorani, Mwangeka street, apartment No. K-16 (hereinafter the suit property).








The Landlord’s depositions


2.
The Landlord’s affidavits in support of his Application may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That he has constructed a residential apartment in the suit property and has lent the same out for residential purposes.
b.
That the Tenant who pays a monthly rent of Kshs. 14,000/= for the apartment has accumulated rent arrears of Kshs. 154,000/=.
c.
That the Tenant failing to pay the rent requested to be allowed to stay on the suit premises on humanitarian grounds.
d.
That after demands for the payment of the rent arrears were made to the Tenant, Counsel for the Landlord eventually issued the Tenant with a notice to vacate dated 15.5.2024 and which was to take effect as at 01.6.2024 to 30
th
 June 2024.
e.
In response to the above notice, the Tenant requested to be paying Kshs. 6,000/= monthly.
f.
That after the lapse of the notice, the Tenant who continuous to default in the payment of rent, occupies the suit premises as a trespasser.








The Tenant’s depositions


3.
The Tenant’s replying affidavit sworn on 25.7.2024 may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That the Respondent is a Tenant of a residential one (1) bedroom flat paying a monthly rent of Kshs. 14,000/= and in the circumstances and in light of the admission by the Landlord, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.
b.
That the alleged notice issued is defective and the Application is also defective for failure to be accompanied by a complaint.








The Landlord’s Further deposition


4.
The Landlord’s further affidavit may also be summarized as follows;-
a.
That he has constructed a commercial premises in the suit premises.
b.
That the Tenant operates the business of selling herbal products in the suit premises.
c.
That a lease agreement was prepared and handed over to the Tenant but he declined to execute the said agreement.
d.
That on 29.3.2024, the Landlord issued the Tenant with a notice to terminate tenancy which notice was duly received and acknowledged by the Tenant.
e.
That the Tenant has not responded to the notice to terminate his tenancy in any manner.
f.
That the suit premises is in disrepair.
g.
That the user of the said premises is commercial even though the Tenant has illegally sublet the premises to persons unknown to the Landlord.
h.
Tha the tenancy herein is a controlled tenancy and the notice to terminate tenancy has been issued in accordance with the provisions of Cap 301 of the Laws of Kenya.
i.
That the Law allows the Landlord to terminate tenancy on account of the non-payment of rent and breach of the terms of the tenancy agreement.
j.
That the notice dated 29.3.2024 is enforceable under Section 10 of Cap 301.








Analysis and determination


5.
The issues that fall for determination in this Application are the following;-
a.
Whether the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter?
b.
Whether the Landlord is entitle to the orders sought in his Application.






Issue A: Whether the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter?


6.
The Tenant’s challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on the deposition by the Landlord at paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said affidavit where it is deposed as follows:
3
- That I have constructed a residential apartment in the suit property and have lent the same for residential purposes.
4
- that I knew the Tenant in the year 2014 when he was referred to me by my caretaker and the said Tenant herein requested for 3 bedroom apartment.






7.
The same Landlord in his further affidavit sworn on 26.7.2024 has deponed as follows;-
Paragraph 
5
: That I constructed a commercial premises, I attach herewith photos of the said premises.
Paragraph 
6
: That on or about 1.04.2014, I knew the Tenant through my agent who requested me to lease him a part of the commercial suit premises for business purposes only.
Paragraph 
10
: That the Tenant proceeded to enter into the premises and operated his business of selling herbal products.






8.
I do note that the Tenant has not denied that he carries out the business of selling herbal produces in the suit premises. Other than relying on the Landlord’s depositions in the first affidavit, the Tenant has not offered any contrary view to the Landlord’s further affidavit. The Tenant has not suggested that he uses the suit premises for residential purposes either.
I have also noted that there does not exist a written lease agreement over the suit premises even though a draft lease has been annexed to the Landlord’s further affidavit. The said draft lease has not been executed by the parties and is therefore of no evidentiary value.






9.
On this issue, I therefore do find that the suit premises is commercial as opposed to residential and further find that there being no written tenancy agreement between the parties, their relationship is that of a controlled tenancy and therefore the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.








Issue B: Whether the Landlord is entitled to the orders sought in his Application.


10.
The Landlord has sought an order that the Tenant renders vacant possession of the suit premises failing which the Landlord be allowed to evict the Tenant. The Landlord’s prayer is premised on the notice to terminate tenancy dated 29.3.2024. I have perused the said notice and I note that the same is dated 29.3.2024 and the date for termination is shown as 29.3.2024. I note at paragraph 
6
 the notice states; “That for the above reasons, you have two months from the date of this notice to vacate the suit premises.”
I do not think paragraph 
6
 reproduced above cures the express effective date of 29.3.2024 in the selfsame notice. I would hold the notice to be defective in so far as it declares itself effective on the same day it was prepared and for further not being specific of the date of termination (effective date) at paragraph 6 of the notice. And I so hold.






11.
I have also perused the notice dated 15.5.2024 and I am satisfied that it does not amount to the notice to terminate tenancy referred to under the provisions of Section 4 of Cap 301. Infact, the notice dated 15.5.2024 seems to me to be a reminder of previous notices. Consequently, the notice dated 29.3.2024 and 15.5.2024 cannot be the basis of granting the orders of vacant possession as sought by the Landlord.






12.
The Landlord has sought further orders that the Tenant be ordered to pay rent arrears in regard to the suit property. According to the Landlord, rent arrears have accumulated to Kshs. 154,000/= and continuous to accrue. The Landlord has exhibited demand letters for the payment of the rent and even responses by the Tenant. The Tenant has not denied owing this rent to the Landlord and from the material placed before me, I am satisfied that indeed the Tenant owes the said rent.










Disposition


13.
In view of the above findings, I hereby make the following orders;-
a.
That the Tenant’s notice of preliminary objection dated 15.7.2024 is hereby dismissed.
b.
That the Landlord’s prayer for vacant possession and the eviction of the Tenant is declined.
c.
That the Tenant owes the Landlord rent arrears amounting to Kshs. 154,000/= as at 5.06.2024.
d.
That the Tenant is to pay the aforesaid rent arrears within the next thirty (30) days of this Ruling FAILING which the Landlord will be at liberty to levy distress against the Tenant for the recovery of the said rent arrears and any accruing rent.






14.
The Complaint by the Landlord dated 1.07.2024 has been conclusively addressed by the findings and orders issued in this Ruling. Consequently, I allow the Complaint in the terms set out in paragraph 
13
 above.






15.
The Tenant will bear the costs of the Application and the Complaint.






16.
This file is hereby ordered closed.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
The Tenant’s notice of motion dated 31.5.2024 seeks an order of injunction restraining the Landlord/Respondent from in any manner interfering with the Tenant’s quiet and peaceful occupation and/or tenancy at the Landlord’s premises known as Venus Plaza Plot No. 209/15382, South C, Shop No. 7 pending the hearing of this Application.








The Tenant’s depositions


2.
The Tenant’s affidavit in support of his Application may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That since the year 2021, the Tenant has peacefully operated his wines and spirits business and has been paying his rent promptly.
b.
That on 1.1.2024, the Tenant’s lease expired and his tenancy reverted to a month to month tenancy and the Tenant has been paying rent since January 2024 to date, which rent the Landlord has at all material times accepted.
c.
That on 21.5.2024, the Landlord issued the Tenant with a notice to vacate and give vacant possession of the premises before 1.8.2024. The Tenant is of the view that the said notice does not conform with the provisions of Section 4(2) of Cap 301 and therefore ought to be struck out.
d.
That the Tenant believes that the Landlord is being used by one Mary Nduta in the issuance of the said notice.
e.
That the Tenant is apprehensive that the Landlord may evict him at any time exposing the Tenant to irreparable harm and damage.








The Landlord’s depositions


3.
The replying affidavit sworn by the Landlord/Respondent on 12.6.2024 may be summarized as follows;-
a.
That the Respondent is the owner of the suit premises comprising of residential and business units.
b.
That the Tenant’s lease agreement for Shop No. 7 in the suit premises expired on 1.3.2024 and the Tenant has not applied for an extension of the said lease.
c.
That the Tenant has admitted receiving the notice to terminate tenancy dated 21.5.2024 which was served upon the Tenant on 22.5.2024.
d.
That the reasons for the termination of the lease is that it had naturally expired and the Landlord now requires to use the premises for his personal business and as his office.
e.
That the Tenant has always known that his tenancy was for a period of five years and three months and therefore his prayer for an injunction are frivolous as the court cannot re-write an agreement for the parties and this prayer is therefore intended to re-open unnecessary litigation.
f.
That the notice served upon the Tenant is legally sound.
g.
That the lease agreement dated 1.1.2024 is self-regulatory and the Tenant ought to allow the Landlord access to the premises for purposes of inspecting the same.








The Tenant’s Further depositions


4.
The Tenant has deponed in his further affidavit that the lease agreement executed between the parties was for a period of five years and not five years three months, the handwritten endorsement of three months has not been counter signed by the parties.






5.
The Tenant has further deponed that the lease agreement does not require him to give notice of extension of the lease.






6.
It is also deponed by the Tenant that the notice issued by the Landlord is fatally defective and the same is incurable.








Analysis and determination


7.
The only issue that arises for determination in this Application is whether the Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in his Application.






8.
It is a ground commonly held between the parties that the lease agreement between the parties expired, although the parties do not seem to agree whether it expired in January 2024 or March 2024. It’s also common ground that the Landlord has continued to accept rent from the Tenant after the lease expired. In these circumstances, the tenancy between the parties became a month to month tenancy.
Section 60(2) of the 
Land Act
 No. 6 of 2012 provides as follows;-
“
A lessor who accepts rent in respect of any period after the lease has been terminated or the term of the lease has expired, shall not by reason of that fact be deemed to have consented to the lessee remaining in possession of the land, or as having given up on any of the rights or remedies of the lessor against the lessee for breach of a covenant or condition of the lease, and if the lessor continues to accept rent from a tenant who remains in possession for two months after the termination of the lease, a periodic lease from month to month shall be deemed to have come into force.”






9.
A periodic lease from month to month is a controlled tenancy within the meaning ascribed to a controlled tenancy under the provisions of Section 2(1)(a) of Cap 301, and therefore subject to the provisions of the said Act. This being the case, if the Landlord was desirous of terminating the lease, and which he seems to have been, then he was required under the provisions of Section 4(2) of Cap 301 to give the Tenant a notice in the form prescribed under that Section.






10.
I have seen the Landlord’s notice to terminate lease dated 21.5.2024. it is not in the mandatory form prescribed under Section 4(2) which is FORM A in the Schedule in the Act. The notice does not conform to the provisions of Section 4(4) and 4(5) of the Act and it is therefore a defective notice, invalid and of no effect.






11.
I have perused the record herein and I do note that on 10.9.2021, the Tribunal allowed the Tenant’s Application dated 22.2.2021 in terms of prayer 4 thereof which effectively restrained the Landlord from in any manner interfering with the Tenant’s quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the tenancy pending the hearing and determination of the Complaint. I do note that the Complaint has not been heard as the parties have not taken any steps to have the matter finally determined.






12.
I have already found the Landlord’s notice to be illegal and of no effect. Consequently, I do find merits in the Tenant’s Application and proceed to allow the same as prayed.






13.
I will further order that the Complaint by the Tenant be fixed for hearing as earlier directed by the court.

Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal against conviction and sentence arising in Othaya Law Courts Criminal case number E001 of 2021 delivered on 15th February, 2021 by Hon. M.N. Munyendo, P.M.)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Elijah Waithaka Mundia, hereinafter referred to as the Appellant, was convicted and sentenced to death for the offence of robbery with violence contrary to Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to ten (10) years imprisonment in respect of the 2nd count of sexual assault contrary to Section 5(1)(a)(i) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No.3 of 2006. The particulars in regards to the 1
st
 count are that, on the 27
th
 day of October, 2020 at Mumbuini village, jointly with others not before the court while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a pistol, robbed A.W.G. KShs.150,000/- and at, or immediately before and immediately after the time of such robbery threatened to use actual violence on the complainant. The particulars in the second count are that, on the 27
th
 day of October, 2020, at Mumbuini village, the Appellant unlawfully used his fingers to penetrate the vagina of A.W.G.






2.
Being dissatisfied with both the conviction and sentence, the Appellant lodged this appeal with nine grounds. The grounds are summarized below:
a.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact on a defective charge sheet that was based on duplicity.
b.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by relying on uncorroborated evidence.
c.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by finding that the Appellant was in possession of a phone and phone number not linked to the Appellant but to other persons.
d.
The learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact in failing to recognize that the evidence adduced was materially contradictory to the root of the matter.
e.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact in failing to recognize that no information was availed in court to prove sexual assault on the complainant.
f.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in both law and fact in failing to appreciate that the instant matter was not proved to the required standard of proof.






3.
It is the duty of the first appellate court to re-evaluate and reconsider fresh evidence on record to arrive at its own conclusion while bearing in mind that it did not have the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. This guiding principle is outlined in the case of Kiilu & another V Republic [2005] 1 KLR 174.






4.
The appeal proceeded by way of written submissions.






Background


5.
PW1, a clinical officer from Othaya sub-county hospital, testified that he filled the P3 form and told the court the medical history contained therein. He stated that the history given by the complainant was that a man entered her house and ordered her to lie on her bed, and inserted his finger in her vagina before stealing from her.  He stated that there were no injuries on the head, thorax, abdomen, and upper and lower limbs. He assessed the age of the injury to the vagina as approximately six days old, and the degree sustained was harm. He stated that the complainant had normal external genitalia with negative return tests save for puss cells in the vagina, demonstrative of interruption of the vaginal lining. On cross-examination, he stated that the complainant was seen on the same day she was allegedly assaulted, and the P3 form was filled out six days later.

She further testified that the assailant asked her to sit up, pulled her skirt up, and inserted his fingers in her vagina on three occasions. According to Pw2, she got up at around 6.00 a.m. and went to her brother-in-law, who came and together they inspected the house and found that the kitchen window glass was broken and the assailant had gained access by cutting the wire mesh and opening the door latches which had not been fastened with a padlock.

According to PW3, the residents said that the Appellant did not live in the area.
PW3 also informed the court that on January 2, 2021, he was asked by DCI officers to help conduct an identification parade. Eight people with similar physical features to the appellant were lined up, but the appellant refused to participate. PW3 stated that the appellant’s allegation that his picture was taken was false. He also stated that the complainant's phones were recovered from the Accused. In cross-examination, he reiterated that at Warazo jet, the appellant’s ex-wife and area chief confirmed that she had remarried and that the accused did not live at the home.
He reiterated that following the appellant’s refusal to participate in the parade, he indicated it in the form produced in court. He stated that only one phone was on during the arrest.

He stated that he extracted the information for 0792xxx961, registered under the name of Peter Mburu Muchangi of ID number 29314776. He stated that the information captured gave details of the transactions done on the account from 26/10/2020 to 30/10/2020. He stated that on 27/10/2020 at 6:22 am, KShs. 35,000/ conversation ID number 386826739064 (indicating the original bank account where the money came from and deposited to 0792xxx961 from an Equity bank account, meaning that the transaction was done from the phone. Secondly, the second transaction was done on the same day at 6:25 am - a business payment was made from Equity Bank via the App for KShs 35,000/-and thirdly, on the same day, a transaction was made at 6:28 am for KShs 35,000/-. He stated that the three transactions took less than three minutes and that they could not tell the account holder from the records.
PW5 then testified that a call data record was generated from 0792xxx961, where he stated that the IMEI number 356535820404230 was in use on 27/12/2020 and IMEI number 35635820404240 was in use as well on the same date until evening, with three different transactions up to 27/10/2020 at 15:07HRS.

He stated that the second device was an ITEL phone with 3 slots meaning it had three IMEIs:356535820404247, 356535820404239, and 356535820404221. He stated that the devices were in use on 27/12/2020. He clarified that for the two of the IMEI numbers ending with 239 in their report, the 15 digit is zero, though the report is a nine.
He stated that the first IMEI number ending with 247 was in use on 27/12 /2020 and is a direct correlation to the physical evidence and report regarding phone number 0792xxx961 for Peter Mburu. He stated that the said line was used in more handsets, but what he presented was critical to the case.
He stated that a certain handset of IMEI number 354120117907940 yielded that other telephone lines had been used by that particular device, and they were 0723xxx007 on 24/10/2020 and 07929xxx621 on 27/10/2020.
PW5 stated that for line 0723 xxx 007, the details were registered as Elijah Waithaka Mundia of ID no 24526099; he produced a history target of IMEI number 354120117907940 as exhibit 21 and subscriber details as Exhibit no. 22.
He stated that where a registering agent is not known, chances are that an ID can be used to register another line by a different person. He stated that an IMEI number is unique and two numbers never exist at any given time. He stated that the history of the IMEI number led to subsequent handsets being found in their report. He stated that Exhibit 19 contains the relationship between the recovered phone and Exhibit 21, given that the details of the other different numbers are in the appellant's name and cannot be separated. He stated that exhibit 19 was used in different handsets as IMEI numbers vary (510,520.050,740). In cross-examination, he stated that exhibits 18 and 19 were from Safaricom. He also stated that in reference to exhibit 18, 27/10/2020 reflects exhibit 19 and shows an SMSHe stated that the MPESA statement does not detail when the phone was used.

He also stated that the target line is currently registered under Judith Aoko, ID number 24473849, from 17/12/2020 to 31/12/2020. He stated that it is not possible for a line to be registered under two names and confirmed that it had two different names as there had been a delay in updating.
He stated that the IMEI number is unique and used the phone number and that he did not investigate the physical device but he did investigate the phone number. He stated that the ITEL had 3 IMEI numbers, that the Nokia has 2 IMEI numbers and that each IMEI number is unique. In re-examination, he stated that he certified DFI-1 and Exhibit 19, and due to the system update, if there is a delay, it can give different details. In reference to exhibit 18, he stated that the money was transferred to Airtel 0108xx080 on the same date at 6:34 am KShs 70,000/- and another KShs 34,500 was sent to 0101xxx272 around the same time. He reiterated that it is impossible for a line to be registered in the name of two different people simultaneously, and Judith Aoko could have been the initial user before Mburu. He stated that data stays on the system for 60 days and gets deleted. He stated that he did not have the call date from 27/10/2020 to 11/11/2020 but had managed to get the data from the system to reveal information, such as the handset used on 27/10/2020(Exhibit 20).






10.
PW6 was the investigating officer. He testified that on 27/10/2020 at 10:30 a.m., he accompanied the OCPD and DCIO to the scene at Mumbuini village in Chinga area.

In cross-examination, he stated that the house had a CCTV camera but was covered in mud. He acknowledged that there was a marginal error of KShs 2,000 as the amount claimed to be stolen was 150,000, and the one reported was 148,000/-. He stated that exhibit 22, no. 0723xxx007, was registered on 20/6/2016, and the Appellant’s card was issued on 6/8/2020 and could have been a replacement. He testified that he could not tell if the Appellant was in Naivasha prison in 2016.

Analysis and determination


13.
The Appellant was charged with the offence of robbery with violence contrary to Section 295, as read with Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code, together with the second count of sexual assault contrary to Section 5 (1) (a) (i) to the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The Appellant has submitted that the charge was fatally defective in duplicity of the robbery with violence charges preferred under Section 295 and Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code.






14.
Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that a charge sheet should be drafted in such a way that; -
i.
it discloses an offence known in law;
ii.
offence is disclosed and stated in a clear and unambiguous manner such that the accused person pleads to a specific charge which is easily under stable so as to also enable the accused person prepare the defence; and
iii.
the charge should contain all the essential ingredients of the offence.






15.
The ambiguity of the framing of the charges of robbery with violence has been dealt with by the courts. The Court of Appeal in Johana Ndungu v Republic [1996] eKLR set down the ingredients of robbery with violence and, in doing so, dealt with the thorny issue of Section 295 of the Penal Code as it relates to Section 296 (2). The Court stated:
“
In order to appreciate properly as to what acts constitute an offence under section 296 (2), one must consider the sub-section in conjunction with section 295 of the Penal Code. The essential ingredient of robbery under section 295 is use of or threat to use actual violence against any person or property at or immediately before or immediately after to further in any manner the act of stealing. Therefore, the existence of the afore-described ingredients constituting robbery are pre-supposed in the three sets of circumstances prescribed in s.296 (2) which we give below, and any one of which if proved will constitute the offence under the sub-section:
i.
If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or
ii.
If he is in company with one or more other person or persons,
iii.
Or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the had a robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other violence to any person.”






16.
The Court of Appeal in Paul Katana Njuguna vs. Republic [2016] eKLR held that:
“
Although the side note describes section 295 as definition of robbery, it is evident that the section goes beyond mere definition and creates a felony termed robbery by setting out clearly the elements of that felony. We are alive to the fact that the First Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code lists the offence of robbery under section 296(1) of the Penal Code; the offence of robbery with violence, under Section 296(2) of the Penal Code.
It is illustrative, however, that at the commencement of that First Schedule, the following caution is given: - ‘The entries in the second and fourth columns of this Schedule headed respectively 'offence' and 'punishment under the Penal Code', are not intended as definitions of the offences and punishments described in the several corresponding sections of the Penal Code, or even as abstracts of those sections, but merely as references to the subject of the section, the number of which is given in the first column.
This Court has on several occasions had to deal with difficulties presented in considering the true purport and intendment of Sections 295, 296(1) and 296(2) of the Penal Code.
In 
Joseph Onyango Owuor & Another vs. Republic [Criminal Appeal No. 353 of 2008
] (UR), the appellants complained that Section 296(2) under which he was charged did not create an offence. He argued that Section 296(2) cannot, therefore, stand on its own. In his view, a charge under Section 296(2) could only be sustained if read with Section 295 of the Penal Code.
We rejected that argument in the following words: ""Likewise, the submission that the violence envisaged under 296(2) is different from that envisaged under Section 295 of the Penal Code is untenable. Section 295, does not deal with the decree of violence being merely a definition section. It is analogous to Section 268 of the Penal Code which deals with definition of ""stealing"" and subsequent sections which deal with different categories of offence of stealing. Section 296(1) and Section 296(2) of the Penal Code deal with the specific degrees of the offence of robbery and have been framed as such"".
The particulars as stated are clear and do support the offence of aggravated robbery. The defect is alleged to be in the statement of the charge in the count in which the appellants was charged with robbery with violence contrary to Section 295 as read with Section 296 (2). Is that fatal"" We think not. In Joseph Onyango Owuor & Another -v- R (supra) this Court found that when dealing with the offence under Section 296(2) of the Penal Code the statement of the offence has to be read as referring to the aggravated circumstances of the offence of robbery provided for under Section 296(1) of the same code. The Court further concluded that ""the submission that the violence envisaged under Section 296(2) is different from that envisaged under Section 295 of the Penal Code is untenable. Section 295, does not deal with the degree of violence being merely a definition section. We have considered the law on duplicity in charges as expounded in case law and academic treatises and find an interesting trend which seems to have emerged. In Laban Koti vs. R. [1962] 1 EA 439 (SCK) … The test still remains as to whether or not a failure of justice has occurred. In our opinion, the result of the application of this test must depend to some extent upon the circumstances of the case and the nature of the duplicity"". “In that case, the court held that the appellants were left in no doubt from the time when the first prosecution witness testified, as to the case which he had to meet and he could not, therefore, be said to have been prejudiced in any way. …in Amos vs. DPP [1988] RTR 198 DC, the Court held that uncertainty in the mind of the accused person is the ""vice at which the rule against duplicity is aimed and to counter a true risk that there may be confusion in the presenting and meeting of charges which are mixed up and uncertain. Back home, in Mwaniki vs. Republic [2001], EA 158 (CAK), this Court held as follows: ""Where two or more offences were charged in the alternative in one count, the charge was bad for duplicity and a substantial defect was created that must be assumed to be embarrassing or prejudicial to an accused as he would not know what he was charged for and if convicted, of what he had been convicted"" On appeal, this Court found that it was not possible to determine which offence the appellants had committed as several offences had been charged in the alternative, the Court stated: ""These clearly were separate offences charged alternatively in one count and in our view, we would respectively follow the decision of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa in Cherere's case which correctly set out the law when the court held that to charge two or more offences in the alternative in one count is not merely a formal but substantial defect and that in such a situation, an accused person must be taken to have been embarrassed or prejudiced as he does not know what he is charged with, and if convicted, of what he has been convicted"". The issue of duplicity of a charge also came up in Dickson Muchiro Mahero vs. Republic [2002] eKLR…The Court found that, indeed, causing death is a distinct offence from dangerous or careless driving or obstruction and that particulars of any charge under Section 46 are offences in themselves. With regard to the appellants’ argument that the charge as framed alleged two offences in one count namely, first, causing death by driving a motor vehicle at a speed and second, by driving a motor vehicle in a manner which was dangerous, the Court held that the particulars were merely intended to give the appellants reasonable information as to the nature of the offence he faced. After considering the record before it, the Court was satisfied that the appellants understood the charge he faced and was in no way prejudiced. The Court in that case cited with approval the English case of Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries and Food vs. Nunn [1978] Ltd [1990], Cr. LR 268 DC, where the court emphasized that the question of duplicity is one of fact and degree; and that the purpose of the duplex rule is to enable the accused to know the case he has to meet. In the matter before us, we are unable to detect any prejudice which the appellants suffered. The record shows that the appellants suffered no confusion when the charge, as framed, was read to him and when the witnesses testified, he fully cross-examined them. He raised no complaint before both the trial court and before the High Court. So, while it would be undesirable to charge an accused person under both sections in the alternative, it would not be prejudicial to that accused person if the offences are not framed in the alternative. As we have already noted the rule against duplicity is to enable an accused know the case has to meet. We accept as the correct position in law that uncertainty in the mind of the accused is the vice at which the rule against duplicity is aimed. If there is no risk of confusion in the mind of the accused as to the charge framed and evidence presented, a charge which may be duplex will not be found to be fatally defective.”






17.
Applying the test in the present case, the Appellant was afforded a fair trial, the case proceeded in a language that he understood and the amended charge was read to the Appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty. The accuracy and correctness of the evidence were tested during the trial. From the cross-examination, he understood the charge that he faced to be robbery with violence. The issue of the duplicity of charges was never raised at the lower court, and there is no possibility that there was any other reference to different charges save for what was presented and read to the Appellant in court. There was no miscarriage of justice occasioned, and the defect in the charge was curable under Section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






18.
The Appellant faced a charge of robbery with violence in count 1. The elements of the offence of robbery with violence were set out by the Court of Appeal in the case of Oluoch-Vs-Republic [1985] KLR thus:
“
Robbery with violence is committed in any of the following circumstances:
a.
The offender is armed with any dangerous and offensive weapon or instrument; or
b.
The offender is in company with one or more person or persons; or
c.
At or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, the offender wounds, beats, strikes or uses other personal violence to any person ........."".






19.
The case of 
Dima Denge Dima & Others vs Republic, Criminal Appeal Noal Appeal No. 300 of 2007
 further held as follows;
“
...The elements of the offence under Section 296 (2) are three in number and they are to be read not conjunctively, but disjunctively. One element is sufficient to found an offence of robbery with violence.”






20.
The trial court, in observing the complainant’s demeanour, stated as follows;
“
I must also state that the complainant was candid and clear in her testimony. She did not embellish her encounter with exaggerations. She remained steadfast even in her testimony and the veracity of her testimony is not in doubt. I believed her.”






21.
In her testimony, PW2 stated that the assailant had a pistol, which she described as black in color, and stated that she could recognize it as such. The trial court assessed the conduct of the complainant beyond the witness’ testimony and made a finding that her conduct was a clear sign that fear had been instilled in her and that she had legitimate apprehension that her safety was compromised. This conduct supports the testimony that the assailant was armed with a dangerous weapon.






22.
In dealing with Count 1 and grounds 2 and 6 of the Appeal, I duly note that PW2, the complainant, is the only witness who saw the assailant that night.
In Kariuki Njiru & 7 others vs Republic, the court held inter alia that;
“
Law on identification is well settled, and this court has from time to time said that the evidence relating to identification must be scrutinized and should only be accepted and acted upon if the court is satisfied that the identification is positive and free from the possibility of error.”






23.
The court in Wamunga v Republic (1989) KLR 424  had this to say about identification:-
“
Where the only evidence against a defendant is evidence of identification or recognition, a trial court is enjoined to examine such evidence carefully and to be satisfied that the circumstances of identification were favorable and free from possibility of error before it can safely make it the basis of a conviction.""






24.
This court is duty-bound to interrogate whether or not the circumstances in the case at hand were favourable for positive identification. The complainant said the ordeal lasted about two hours. She mentioned that the assailant wore a mask and a cap, covering most of his face except for his eyes and nose. Her observation of the assailant was brief as he quickly ordered her to lie down and covered her with a Maasai shuka.






25.
The assailant allegedly brandished a torch, potentially hindering the victim's ability to identify him clearly. Additionally, the complainant, in her evidence before the court, stated that the torch shone very brightly and that the assailant approached and pushed her to go back to sleep facing down. She remained in this position until the assailant asked her to turn. Even then, she remained lying down and could not, in the circumstances, be said to provide identification free from the possibility of error.






26.
With the above finding on non-reliance on identification, I proceeded to re-examine and analyze the rest of the proven facts in the case. The courts have held that in considering circumstantial evidence, a combination of facts must create a network through which an accused cannot escape because the facts taken as a whole do not admit any inference but of his guilt.






27.
The way to deal with circumstantial evidence was stated in TOPER V. R. (1952)A.C. as follows:-
“
Circumstantial evidence must always be narrowly examined, if only because evidence of this kind may be fabricated to cast suspicion on another. It is also necessary before drawing the inference of the accused's guilt from circumstantial evidence to be sure that there are no other co-existing circumstances which would weaken or destroy the influence.”






28.
The evidence before the court is that money was transferred from the complainant’s mobile lines during the robbery. The appellant is in the picture upon arrest in Othaya town shortly over two months after the date the matter was reported to the police. He was found with an assortment of sim cards from Airtel, Safaricom, and Telkom, memory cards, and two phones. The two phones are of makes ITEL and NOKIA. The ITEL has three SIM card slots, meaning it houses and operates three SIM cards, and the Nokia has one slot. Each SIM slot, when housing any given sim card from any service provider, has a unique, unchangeable IMEI number. This means that though different SIM cards may be slotted. The housing is still the same.






29.
If a slotted sim card with a specific IMEI is inserted and used, then any transaction will bear that digital fingerprint, be it a call, SMS, or any communication that sees the device communicate with another party.






30.
The question and the crux of this circumstantial evidence are: When the money was transferred by the Assailant on the morning of 27/10/2020, was it transferred to any of the four IMEI numbers unique to the phones found on the Appellant's person?






31.
PW5 and PW6 gave crucial evidence on digital prints left behind due to the money transfers. PW5 stated that on 27th October 2020, 0792940961 was linked to IMEI no. 35653582040423. The same phone number, 0792 940 961, on 27/10/2020, was then slotted into a device that had the IMEI number 356535820404240. On a later date to wit: 31/12/202, the same phone number, 0792 940 961, was operated on a device with IMEI number 356968097726903. The Nokia phone, which the appellant had at the time of arrest, has the IMEI number 356968097726903. Further, PW 5 thereafter produced exhibit 19, which indicated that the phone number 0792 940 961 was used from an IMEI phone that was also found on the person of the Appellant.






32.
The target number, though registered in the name of Peter Mburu, was found to have operated on a phone found on the Appellant's when he was arrested on 31/12/2020. Though registered in the name of Peter Mburu, the line was used on the morning of 27/10/2020 and the day of arrest on 31/12/2020. Thus, linking the appellant as the operator of the target line. The Appellant did not deny that the handsets were found on him. The prosecution tendered evidence that clarified the registration of mobile lines and displaced the defence as stated by the appellant. The inventory was properly taken, and the appellant signed the same; I have re-evaluated the evidence by the arresting officer and the investigating officer and I am persuaded that the items were in the appellant’s possession.






33.
Conclusively, the two handsets recovered from the Appellant had the exact IMEI numbers as captured in Exhibit 19, and the two handsets interacted with the target number. On 27/10/2020, 0792 940 961 was paired with 354120117907940, and the same IMEI number was paired with 0723 474 007 on 24/10/2020 and 27/10/2020. 0723 474 007 is registered in the name of the appellant, and the 0792 940 961, though registered in another name, was paired with the same IMEI number 354120117907940 found in a phone that the appellant had at the time of arrest. The limbs of robbery with violence disjunctively proved are enough to prove the offence.






34.
The evidence regarding the appellant's participation is so strong that there are no other co-existing circumstances that would displace his participation. The alibi defence presented lacks credibility, and no doubt has been cast on the prosecution's case.






35.
On Count 2 on Sexual Assault contrary to Section 5 (1) (a) (i) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No.3 of 2006, given the evidence above that places the appellant at the scene, Pw2’s testimony that the appellant inserted his fingers into her vagina is believable. She gave a detailed testimony that the appellant instructed her to sit up so as to have his finger in her vagina on three occasions. The medical evidence that the vaginal wall had puss cells is consistent with assault or forceful entry/penetration and corroborates the complainant’s testimony.






36.
In the decision of John Irungu Vs Republic (2016), EKLR, the Court of Appeal stated that penetration can be occasioned by any body part or object. The penetration by the appellant using his fingers amounts to sexual assault.








CONCLUSION


37.
The upshot is that the prosecution has discharged the burden of proof to the required standard that the appellant broke into the complaint’s house while armed with a dangerous weapon, making away with mobile money and hard currency. And that during the robbery, sexually assaulted the complainant.






38.
I concur fully with the conclusions of the learned trial magistrate in convicting the Appellant in Count 1 of the offence of robbery with violence contrary to Section 296(2) of the penal code and Count 2 of Sexual Assault contrary to Section 5 (1) (a) (i) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, No.3 of 2006. The appellant was afforded a fair trial, and the conviction was safe. The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.








ON SENTENCE


39.
The appellant was sentenced to death as per Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code in Count 1. A 10-year sentence was meted in count 2 but held in abeyance because of the death sentence. The death sentence is still valid in law and applicable as a sentence. The trial court considered the Appellant's mitigation, the criminal record presented by the prosecutor, and the aggravating factors in the victim assessment when determining the sentence. The trial court was cognizant of the seriousness of the offences.






40.
The Appellant was convicted on 15
th
 February 2022. On 19
th
 July 2023, vide a gazette notice number 9566, the President, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Article 133 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and Section 23 (1) of the 
Power of Mercy Act
, 2011, commuted the death sentence imposed on every capital offender as of 21
st
 November, 2022, to a life sentence.






41.
Indeterminate imprisonment has been held to be unconstitutional and in 
Manyeso v Republic (Criminal Appeal 12 of 2021
) [2023] KECA 827 (KLR) (7 July 2023), the Court of Appeal substituted life imprisonment with 40 years.






42.
Given the circumstances of this case and the commuted sentence, I hereby substitute the sentence in count 1 to forty (40) years. The sentence in count 2 is upheld. The sentences shall run concurrently as the offences arise from the same incident. The appellant remained in custody upon arrest on 31
st
 December, 2020 and during trial, the prison authorities shall take into account this period from arrest in the computation of the sentence.






43.
It is so ordered.

Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
 Cap 301 in which it opposes a notice to terminate tenancy issued by the respondent herein.






2.
On 27
th
 May 2024, the reference was dismissed for want of prosecution.

The applicant filed a notice of motion under a certificate of urgency dated 5
th
 July 2024 in which it sought for the following orders; -
i.
That the application be certified urgent.
ii.
That there be a temporary injunction prohibiting the respondent and/or his agents from harassing, threatening and/or evicting the applicant pending the hearing and determination of the application.

iv.
That the court be pleased to reinstate the applicant’s reference dated 19
th
 April 2024 for hearing and determination.
v.
That costs of the application be provided for.






4.
The application is supported by an affidavit of even date in which the applicant deposes as follows; -
i.
That the applicant instituted the proceedings herein against the respondent vide a reference dated 19
th
 April 2024 filed on 30
th
 April 2024.
ii.
That the same was duly served on 17
th
 May 2024. A copy of the affidavit of service is annexed as “AK 1”.
iii.
That the respondent did not enter appearance and/or file a notice or any response in respect to the said reference.
iv.
That the advocate while following up the matter through the e-filing portal came to the realization that the reference came up for mention on 27
th
 May 2024 and the same was terminated/struck out/dismissed for want of prosecution.
v.
That the applicant’s advocate was not served with a mention notice for 27
th
 May 2024 and therefore did not attend the tribunal session and consequently the reference was dismissed.
vi.
That the applicant is keen to prosecute the reference.
vii.
That no prejudice will be suffered by the respondent if the reference is reinstated.






5.
On 8
th
 July 2024, the court issued a temporary order of injunction against the respondent pending hearing of the application inter-partes.






6.
The application is opposed vide a replying affidavit dated 15
th
 July 2024 in which the respondent deposes as follows; -
i.
That the applicant is not the respondent’s tenant and is a stranger to the respondent.
ii.
That the tenant who occupies the respondent’s premises known as Kipsetim Building, Kabarnet Plot No.9038/232 is one Caroline Jepkoech Kenei with whom the respondent has a lease agreement with. A copy of the said lease agreement dated 8
th
 January 2018 is annexed as “JK 1(a) and (b)”.

v.
That sometime in the month of June 2024, the respondent received a reference by the tenant in Tribunal Case No. E055 OF 2024 between Galaczy Ventures Companyand the respondent, and since the applicant is not the respondent’s tenant, he did not bother to respond to the same since he had no tenancy relationship with them.
vi.
That the applicant is a legal entity separate from the respondent’s tenant one Caroline Jepkoech Kenei hence they are distinct and not one and the same person.
vii.
That the dismissal was regular in that, equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent.
viii.
That upon service of the notice to Caroline Jepkoech Kenei, the said Caroline Jepkoech Kenei failed/or neglected to respond and as such the respondent has filed an application vide Tribunal Cause No. E089 of 2024 seeking for her eviction from the respondent’s premises. A copy of the application is annexed as “JK 5”.

That according to the lease agreement dated 8
th
 January 2018 and particularly paragraph 
14
, the tenant (Caroline Jepkoech Kenei) has no powers to sublet the premises without the permission of the respondent’s agents. So, if she has sublet the suit premises, then she has breached the terms of the lease agreement.
x.

xiii.
That if the application is allowed, the respondent will suffer irreparable loss and damage.






7.
During the hearing on 16
th
 July 2024, this Tribunal directed that the application be disposed of by way of written submissions. Only the applicant complied by filing its submissions dated 30
th
 July 2024 which we shall consider while dealing with the issues for determination.








B. Issues for Determination


8.
The following are the issues for determination; -
a.
Whether the applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 5
th
 July 2024.
b.
Who shall bear the costs of the application?






Issue (a) Whether the applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 5
th
 July 2024.


9.
The applicant approached this tribunal seeking for orders to set aside the order issued on 27
th
 May 2024 and for reinstatement of its reference dated 19
th
 April 2024 for hearing and determination.






10.
The applicant in its written submissions avers that Order 12 Rule 7 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010 gives this court discretion to set aside any judgement or order upon such terms that it deems fit and just.






11.
The applicant has referred the court to the case of Anthony Kiprop (suing as the legal representative of the estate of Luka Kiprop Kiptai) v Sylvester Chemweno Sang & 2 others [2020] eKLR where the superior court outlined the parameters to be observed when exercising its discretion in an issue of this nature as follows; -
‘a)
Whether there is sufficient reasons or explanation for non-attendance;
b)
Whether there was unreasonable delay in filing the application;
c)
Whether there will be any prejudice.’






12.
We note that the orders of 27
th
 May 2024 dismissing the reference was on account of want of prosecution.






13.
The reason given by the applicant for non-attendance/want of prosecution on the 27
th
 May 2024 has been deposed in the applicants supporting affidavit as well as stated in the written submissions which was that the applicant’s advocate was never served with the mention date and that it was not deliberate.






14.
The above claim has not been disputed by the respondent in his replying affidavit.






15.
The respondent in his replying affidavit has stated that he would be prejudiced by the reinstatement of the reference but upon perusal of the filed documents, the respondent has not demonstrated the prejudice he is likely to suffer.






16.
The applicant further submits that the respondent did not participate in any way in the dismissal of the reference and that he admits that he was served with the reference but preferred not to enter appearance nor file any response to the same.






17.
We note that the respondent in his replying affidavit has given reasons why he never bothered to file any response to the said reference, however the same are not part of the application herein and therefore this tribunal shall only focus on the issues raised in the application.






18.
Additionally, the applicant submits that addressing the issues in the respondent’s replying affidavit will amount to sub-judice as they are subject to a petition pending before the High Court.






19.
On the other hand, the applicant has stated in its submissions that it stands to suffer great prejudice if the reference is not reinstated as it would face eviction by the respondent and in turn eventual closure of its business.






20.
Based on the above analysis, we find and hold that the applicant is entitled to the orders sought in the application dated 5
th
 July 2024 and the reference dated 19
th
 April 2024 is hereby reinstated for hearing on merit.








Issue (b) Who shall bear the costs of the application?


21.
As regards costs, the same are in the tribunal’s discretion under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall order the costs of the application to abide the outcome of the reference.










C. Orders


22.
In conclusion, the following orders commend to us; -
a.
The application dated 5th July 2024 is hereby allowed.
b.
Parties are granted 30 days hereof to comply with Order 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules by filing witnesses’ statements and any other documents in support of their respective cases.
c.
Costs of the application shall abide the outcome of the hearing of the main reference.




It is so ordered.
