 December, 2023 pending the hearing and determination of Kakamega Civil Appeal No. E005 of 2024.
d.
That costs of this application be provided for.






2.
The Application is premised on the grounds on its face which are inter alia that: the Applicant was aggrieved with the judgment of this Tribunal delivered on 14
th
 December 2023 and has filed an appeal. It is the Applicants contention that the appeal has a high chance of success and that he stands a substantial loss unless the orders sought are granted since the Claimant could proceed to execute at any time.






3.
The brief background of this matter is that the claimant filed a Statement of Claim dated 12
th
 August 2021, in which he sought an order, which was granted, that “ This honorable court issue an order restraining the 1
st
 and the second respondent, their employee, servants, auctioneers or anybody acting on their behalf from deducting the Claimant’s salary on a loan by the 1
st
 Respondent to the 2
nd
 Respondent, of Kshs. 750,000/- plus accrued interests of Kshs. 143,541/-. It was the Claimant’s contention that he did not sign up to be a guarantor but this was done fraudulently by the 1
st
 Respondent.






4.
The Claimant filed Grounds of Opposition. In their Grounds of Opposition, the Claimants contend that the Application does not meet the legal threshold for the grant of stay of execution pending Appeal as no substantial loss has been demonstrated by the Applicant.






5.
In their submissions, the Respondents reiterate their Grounds of Opposition that the Applicants have failed to prove specific details of the loss. They also contend that the decretal sum should be deposited in a joint interest-earning account.






Analysis


6.
This Tribunal has noted the application, the response, and the submissions with regard to this application. It is not in dispute that judgment was entered in favour of the Claimant as against the Respondent. The question that this Tribunal asks itself is whether the Applicant is entitled to the reliefs sought, to wit stay of proceedings and execution of the judgment pending determination of the Appeal.






7.
The principles guiding the grant of a stay of execution pending appeal are well settled. These principles are provided for under Order 42 rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides:
“
No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the Applicant.”






8.
In the Court of Appeal decision in Chris Munga N. Bichage –vs- Richard Nyagaka Tongi & 2 Others eKLR the Learned Judges stated the principles to be applied in considering an application for stay of execution as thus:-
“
……………. The law as regards applications for stay of execution, stay of proceedings or injunction is now well settled. The Applicant who would succeed upon such an Application must persuade the court on two limbs, which are first, that his appeal or intended appeal is arguable, that is to say it is not frivolous. Secondly, that if the application is not granted, the success of the appeal, were it to succeed, would be rendered nugatory. These two limbs must both be demonstrated and it would not be enough that only one is demonstrated………”






9.
Further in RWW v EKW [2019] eKLR, considered the purpose of a stay of execution order pending appeal, in the following words:
“
The purpose of an application for stay of execution pending an appeal is to preserve the subject matter in dispute so that the rights of the appellant who is exercising the undoubted right of appeal are safeguarded and the appeal if successful, is not rendered nugatory. However, in doing so, the court should weigh this right against the success of a litigant who should not be deprived of the fruits of his/her judgment. The court is also called upon to ensure that no party suffers prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs.”






10.
From the above authorities, it is clear that the purpose of granting a stay is to preserve the subject matter so that if the appeal succeeds it is not rendered nugatory. What is the subject matter of this appeal? To enforce the guarantee contract against the Claimant/Respondent. Is there a risk that the appeal will be rendered nugatory if these orders are not granted? We feel not. The Applicant has not shown specifically how it will incur financial loss should we not grant a stay.






11.
The Claimant is a school teacher who is still servicing a personal loan from the Applicant. It is on record that the Applicant reversed the amount it had recovered from the Claimant as a guarantor since his salary could not bear both his loan and the guaranteed amount. We feel that should the appeal succeed, nothing will bar the Applicant from recovering the defaulted amount from the Claimant, since if the Claimant was indeed a guarantor, the guarantee contract will still be in force, since a contract of guarantee only lapses when the loaned amount has been fully settled.






12.
In the upshot of the foregoing, we make the following orders;
a.
Notice of Motion Application dated 24
th
 January 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs.
b.
File ordered as closed.

          (Being an appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Kericho (Mumbi Ngugi, J.) dated 21st February 2018 in HC.CR.A. No. 11 of 2017)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The appellant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to section 8(1) as read with section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006.






2.
The particulars of the offence were that on 8
th
 March 2016 at [Paritculars Withheld], Ainamoi Location within Kericho County, the appellant intentionally and unlawfully caused his genital organ (penis), to penetrate the genital organ (vagina), of D.C. a girl, aged 9 years.






3.
In the alternative, the appellant was charged with the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






4.
The appellant pleaded ‘not guilty’ to the charges. To advance its case against the appellant, the prosecution called six witnesses. At the end of the trial, the appellant was found guilty, he was convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment.






5.
Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, the appellant appealed to the High Court. His appeal was dismissed and his conviction and sentence were upheld.






6.
The prosecution’s case was that the complainant, who testified as PW1 was 9 years old and in class 3. In her unsworn testimony, the complainant told the court that she left school at about 4:00 pm on 8th February 2016 and went home. She then went to her friend, C’s home where she found C’s father, (the appellant) outside. When she went inside the house, the appellant followed her and asked her to undress but she refused. He then removed her underpants and slept on her using his manhood. She felt pain and cried but no one came. She went back home but did not tell her mother what had happened.






7.
According to PW2, who is the complainant’s mother, the complainant was born on 31st August 2007. She told the court that on 9th February 2016, she was informed by PW3 that the appellant had told PW3 that he had chased the complainant and another boy from his house and that PW3 had seen the complainant leaving while crying, walking with difficulty, and also trying to put on her biker. On asking the complainant what had happened, the complainant told her that she had gone to look for C when the appellant got hold of her and defiled her.






8.
She told the court that she noticed the complainant was walking with difficulty, and she took her to Ainamoi Health Centre. She then reported the matter to the Chief who then referred her to the police. Upon being issued with a P3 form, she took the complainant to Kericho District Hospital where the complainant was examined. She informed the court that the appellant and her husband were cousins, they had a good relationship with no disputes.






9.
PW3 told the court that she had been walking home on the material day and when she passed near the appellant’s house, he asked her whether she had seen any boy going away. She told the appellant that she had not seen any boy but she had met the complainant a few meters from the appellant’s house, walking while trying to put on her clothes and also crying. She informed the complainant’s mother of this matter the following day. She told the court that the appellant was a distant brother-in-law with whom she had a good relationship.






10.
According to PW4, she had seen the complainant at the appellant’s home on the material day. At first, she thought it was the appellant’s daughter but the appellant told her that it was the complainant. She later learned that the appellant had defiled the complainant.






11.
PW5 was the Investigating Officer.






12.
PW6 was a clinical officer. He produced the P3 form which had been filled and signed by Yego Kirwa who had examined the complainant 13 days after the incident. The report showed that the complainant had a bruised labia majora and bruises on the vagina walls with a moderate amount of pus cells and red blood cells. Mr. Yego had formed the opinion that the complainant had been defiled.






13.
In his unsworn testimony, the appellant stated that the offence he knew about was not the one read to him in court. He told the court about 13th June 2016 when he was informed that PW2’s cattle were on his farm. He had driven the cattle out of his home and PW2 later came to insult him. He was then arrested on 18th June 2016.






14.
The trial court held that the complainant fell within the age bracket provided for under section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 based on her birth certificate which indicated that she was born on 30th August 2007. The court also held that penetration had been proved through the evidence of PW2, PW3, PW4, and PW6.






15.
On appeal, the learned Judge held that the complainant was 8 years old at the time when she was defiled having been born on 30th August 2007 as per the birth certificate.






16.
The learned Judge further held that the appellant was someone the complainant knew as the father of her friend C, and she could not have made an error about his identity. The complainant had also been seen standing by the appellant’s door by PW4 and PW3 had seen her walking away while crying near the appellant’s house.






17.
The learned Judge held that penetration had been proved by medical evidence and the testimony of the complainant that the appellant had followed her to the house, removed her biker, and defiled her.






18.
The learned Judge found the contradictions in the dates mentioned by the witnesses, especially the complainant, not to be material.






19.
Consequently, the learned Judge upheld the appellant’s conviction and the sentence.






20.
Being dissatisfied with the judgment, the appellant lodged the appeal herein in which he raised the following supplementary grounds of appeal:
a.
The appellant pleaded not guilty.
b.
The learned Judge erred in relying on medical evidence which was questionable and insufficient.
c.
The learned Judge erred in failing to find that the appellant was not issued with witness statements.
d.
The age of the complainant was not conclusively proved.
e.
The complainant’s mother was only suspicious that the complainant was defiled.
f.
Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 was wrongly used without cogent reasons.






21.
When the appeal came up for hearing on 9
th
 April 2024, the appellant was present in person, whereas Mr. Omutelema, Assistant Deputy Director of Prosecutions was present for the respondent. The parties relied on their respective written submissions.






22.
In his written submissions, the appellant submitted that the prosecution case was not proved beyond reasonable doubt as there was inconclusive evidence of penetration as the person who examined the complainant was his brother and he sent his friend to produce the P3 form and the appellant was not able to cross- examine him on the same.






23.
The appellant submitted that he was prejudiced when he was not issued with witness statements as he was not able to adequately prepare for the trial and his right under Article 50(2)(c) of 
the Constitution
 was contravened.






24.
He contended that the age of the complainant was not proven as the complainant was not subjected to an age assessment to confirm how old she was.






25.
He attributed the case against him to a grudge between PW2 and himself. He also submitted that his defence was not considered.






6.
The appellant submitted that the sentence against him was unlawful because the mandatory nature of the life imprisonment under Section 8(2) took away the discretion of the court in sentencing.






7.
Opposing the appeal, Mr. Omutelema submitted that the appellant was allowed to cross-examine the complainant as opposed to his allegation that he did not cross-examine the complainant. Counsel further submitted that the appellant had requested for statements on 15
th
 August 2016 and the court directed that he be given the same. Later, when the matter came up for hearing, the appellant informed the court that he was ready to proceed and he did not raise the issue of statements again.






8.
In their written submissions, the respondent submitted that the age of the complainant was proved by the birth certificate. The respondent further submitted that the conviction of the appellant was founded on evidence and the right principles and not on suspicion as alleged by the appellant.






29.
The respondent urged us to consider the indeterminate nature of the life imprisonment and substitute the same with a severe determinate sentence.






30.
This is a second appeal. Section 361(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code enjoins us to consider only questions of law. In the case of Karani v Republic [2010] 1 KLR 73 the court stated thus:
“
This is a second appeal. By dint of the provisions of section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code, we are enjoined to consider only matters of law. We cannot interfere with the decision of the superior court on facts unless it is demonstrated that the trial court and the first appellate court considered matters they ought not to have considered or that they failed to consider matters they should have considered or that looking at the evidence as a whole they were plainly wrong in their decision, in which case such omission or commission would be treated as matters of law.”






31.
We have carefully considered the record of appeal, the written submissions by both parties, the authorities cited, and the law. The issue for determination is whether or not the prosecution proved the offence of defilement against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt, and whether or not the mandatory minimum sentence meted against the appellant was lawful.






32.
As grounds 2, 3, 5, and 6 were not raised before the first appellate court, we find that this Court has no jurisdiction to determine the said issues as this Court sitting as a second appellate court can only entertain matters that were considered by the court being appealed from. An appeal can only lie where there has been a decision made by a lower court. If an issue was not brought up before the lower court, and therefore not determined, then any decision made by the appellate court would not be considered a judgment on an appeal.






33.
In the case of Peter Kihia Mwaniki v Republic [2010] eKLR, this Court stated thus:
“
Neither the appellant nor the prosecution raised any issue concerning the delay in bringing the appellant to court. Nor was the issue raised before the superior court on the first appeal. It was in either of those courts that the issue should have been raised so that an inquiry would be made regarding the issue, when both sides would possibly call evidence on the matter…By raising the issue at this late stage the appellant has, in a way denied the prosecution the Constitutional opportunity to explain the delay. This ground likewise has no merit.”






34.
Similarly, in the John Kariuki Gikonyo v Republic [2019] eKLR case, this Court held that:
“Similarly from the grounds of appeal and the submissions by counsel for the appellant the question of whether the amended charge sheet was signed by a qualified person and whether the charge sheet was fatally defective for failure to describe the property was also not raised before the two courts below. Though the appellant was represented by counsel, no mention of this was made before the first appellate court nor has any explanation been given for such failure. We also find some of the contestations with regard to procedural irregularities such as whether the substance of the charge was explained to the appellant; whether the appellant ought to have been informed of his right to recall witnesses and/or of his right to counsel; and whether the trial court properly weighed the propriety of allowing the amendment of charge prior to allowing it; are all issues that only sprung up in the present appeal. The question that follows is how then can the learned first appellate Judge be faulted for having failed to address issues that were never placed before her"" This Court when faced with a similar issue in 
Alfayo Gombe Okello v. Republic [2010] eKLR Criminal Appeal No. 203 of 2009
; held as follows: “….the issue was not raised since the trial began and was only raised for the first time in this second appeal. The appellant gave no reason for failure to do so earlier. We must therefore find, and we now do so, that it was not raised at the earliest opportunity although it could and should have.” Page 11 of 20 [18] In line with that finding, we are disinclined to address matters where there is no opinion by the two courts below on new issues introduced for the first time on a second appeal.”






35.
Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides that:
“
A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement.”






36.
Under the 
Sexual Offences Act
, the elements of the offence of defilement are as follows: the victim must be a minor, there must be penetration of the genital organ, but such penetration need not be complete, partial penetration will suffice, and the identity of the perpetrator must be established. For the offence of defilement to be established, the prosecution must prove each of the above elements. In the case of Charles Karani v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 72 of 2013, the court stated that:
“
The critical ingredients forming the offence of defilement are; the age of the complainant, proof of penetration, and positive identification of the assailant.”






37.
It is trite that the burden of proof regarding the age of the complainant lies with the prosecution. According to Section 8(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, a person is considered to have committed defilement if they engage in an act that involves penetration with a child. The definition of a child is as outlined in Section 2(1) of the 
Children Act
, which means any person under the age of 18 years.






38.
In the case of Kaingu Elias Kasomo v Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 504 of 2010, the court emphasized the importance of proving the age of the victim of defilement, as the sentence imposed upon conviction depends on the victim’s age.






39.
In this case, the complainant testified that she was 9 years old.
This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of PW2, the complainant’s mother, who testified that the complainant was born on 30th August 2007. PW2 also produced a birth certificate which showed that the complainant was born on 30th August 2007. All the evidence adduced pointed to the complainant having been 8 years old at the time when she was defiled. In the case of 
Richard Wahome Chege v Republic, Criminal Appeal No 61 of 2014
, the court held that:
“
On the contention that the age of the complainant was not established, it is our considered view that age is not proved primarily by the production of a birth certificate. PW2 the mother of the complainant testified that the complainant was 10 years old. What better evidence can one get than that of the mother who gave birth? It is our considered view that the age of the complainant was not only proved by PW2 but supportive evidence was given by PW3 [the doctor] who examined the complainant, and the complainant herself.”






40.
In the case of Francis Omuron v Uganda, Criminal Appeal No. 2 of 2000, the Court of Appeal of Uganda held that:
“In defilement cases, medical evidence is paramount in determining the age of the victim and the doctor is the only person who could professionally determine the age of the victim in the absence of any other evidence. Apart from medical evidence age may also be proved by birth certificate, the victim’s parent or guardian, and by observation and common sense.”






41.
We find that the complainant’s age was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be 8 years at the time of the incident.






42.
The complainant narrated to the court how she went to C’s house and on arriving she found that C was not there but the appellant was outside. She then went inside the house to wait for C who had gone to Cheruto’s house. However, while inside, the appellant came in and asked her to undress. When she refused, he removed her pants and defiled her.






43.
This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of PW5 who produced the P3 form indicating that the complainant’s vagina was bruised, and the officer who had examined the complainant, in his expert opinion, had concluded that there was penetration.






44.
Furthermore, PW4 had seen the complainant at the appellant’s home and even confused her with the appellant’s daughter, and PW3 had met the complainant crying while trying to put on her biker a few meters from the appellant’s house.






45.
We are of the considered view that this evidence is sufficient proof of penetration.






46.
As regards the identity of the appellant, the complainant knew the appellant as C’s father, PW2 knew him as her husband’s cousin, and PW3 knew him as a distant brother-in-law. When PW2 asked the complainant what had happened, the complainant mentioned the appellant as the person who had defiled her. This was not an issue in contention.






47.
This is satisfactory proof that the appellant was well-known to the said witnesses. The risk of mistaken identity was non- existent. Therefore, this was a case based on recognition as opposed to identification by a stranger. In the case of Anjononi & Others v Republic (1976-1980) KLR 1566, the court held that:
“
…when it comes to identification, the recognition of an assailant is satisfactory, more assuring, and more reliable than the identification of a stranger because it depends upon personal knowledge of the assailant in some form or other.”






48.
In the circumstances, we find that the appellant was positively identified through recognition by the prosecution witnesses.






49.
The appellant contended that his defence that PW2 held a grudge against him because he had driven her cattle out of his farm was not considered. This allegation was raised for the first time during the appellant’s defence. We find this allegation to be an afterthought given that the issue of cattle came to be three months after the complainant had been defiled. In any event, the said defence does not in any way displace the prosecution case against the appellant.






50.
In the result, we find that all the ingredients of the offence of defilement were proved beyond any reasonable doubt. We find no reason to interfere with the findings of fact by the two courts below. The appellant’s conviction was safe.






51.
As regards the sentence meted against the appellant, Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides that:
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.”






52.
As the issue of the sentence was not raised before the High Court as a first appellate court, this Court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the same, as was held in the case of Republic v Joshua Gichuki Mwangi, Petiti
on No. E018 of 2023
.






53.
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal in its entirety and uphold the appellant’s conviction and sentence.
Orders accordingly.

Nature of Mention Application


1.
The Notice of Motion Application dated 28
th
 March, 2023 and filed on 29
th
 March, 2023 is brought under Article 159 of 
the Constitution
, Section 1A,1B,3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 40 Rule 1,2,4 (1) Order 51 Rule 1,2,3,4, 10, 11 and 12 of the Civil Procedure Rules, Rule of the Co-operative Tribunal Certificate and Procedure Rules 2009 seeking among other orders that:
a.
Spent
b.
The Honorable court be pleased the issue the orders to temporary injunction restraining the Respondent whether by themselves their servants/ agents/auctioneers or any person they may purport to appoint from cheating disposing/ selling or dealing in a manner with all Applicant’s business stock or business pending the hearing and determination of the noted suit.
c.
The Honorable court be pleased the issue the orders of temporary injunction restraining the Respondent whether by themselves their servants’/ agents Auctioneers or any person they may purpose to appoint from alienating disposing/ selling or dealing in any manner with all Applicant’s business stock or business pending the hearing and determination of the Application
d.
The Honorable court be to direct that the Applicant continues paying the Respondent on weekly tasks as agreed pending hearing and determination of the suit






2.
The Application was on the grounds that:
i.
The Claimants is a member of the Respondent Sacco who had saved and qualified for she had facility
ii.
The Claimant applied and received a facility of Kshs. 4,000,000/= which she used to open and operate a business at the Wetlands City Council Market and began repaying as agreed
iii.
The Applicant religious repaid the suit facility for over one year before facing setbacks in the business at which paint she negotiated with Respondent who agreed that she could make weekly payments until settlement in full.
iv.
The Applicant been serving the said 10am on a weekly basis paying from Kshs 1000/= which payments the Respondent has been receipting faithfully thereby reducing the balance to Kshs. 225,222.32/= however the Respondent shyly send Icon Auctioneer’s to recover the Applicant’s business stock even without notice despite the Applicant making all efforts to repay the loan.






3.
The Tribunal on 30
th
 March, 2023 issued an order of temporary injunction restraining the Respondent by themselves/ servants/ Agents/ Auctioneer’s or any person that may purported to appoint from disposing/ selling or dealing in any manner with all Applicant’s business stock or business pending for mention for further directions. That orders were subsequently extended on 17
th
 August, 2023 where parties were ordered to file supplementary documents.
Now that supplementary documents have filed has the Applicant made a case for orders of temporary injunction








Orders for temporary injunction


4.
The consideration for grant of orders of temporary injunction are well known as set clearly in the judicial decision of Giella Versus Cassman Brown(1973) EA358 which this Tribunal to consider whether the applicant has satisfied the title requirements of:
i.
Establishing their case of a Prima Face Level
ii.
Demonstrating that they will suffer an irreparable injury that claim of be compensated by costs if they are not granted the orders on temporary injunction the applicant
iii.
Showing that the balance of convince is in her in the event that there are debts to (ii) above






5.
To begin with the first requirement to establish a prima face case the Applicant needed to convince this Tribunal of the existence of legal right which has been infringed on the other party, from evidence before court, there seems to be consented payments weekly which tends to suggest that the Applicant is “honoring” some arrangements and or agreement and as such to send auctioneers will infringe on that arrangements
Second it is not in doubt that if the stock of the Applicant is proclaimed by auctioneers she will suffer damage as she is using those stocks to “honor” the arrangements they have with Respondent






6.
In as much as its not the role of courts and tribunals to re-write contracts and Agreement between parties to mean parties will not evade forever from honoring their commitments, we give the applicant the benefit of doubt by issuing the orders of temporary injunction till the determination of the case as the Respondent has also now filed a counter- claim.


Final orders
i.
Application dated 29/3/23 is merited and we allow prayers number C-
a.
The Honorable court is pleased the issue the orders of temporary injunction restraining the Respondent whether by themselves their servants’/ agents Auctioneers or any person they may purpose to appoint from alienating disposing/ selling or dealing in any manner with all Applicant’s business stock or business pending the hearing and determination of the Application.

Notice of Motion


1.
The Notice of motion application dated 8
th
 November 2022 is brought under Sections 1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, 63 (e), 80, order 45, order 51 of the Civil Procedure Rules and all other enabling provisions of the law seeking among others orders that;
i.
Spent
ii.
The court reviews, varies and rescinds the judgment and/or consequential order issued on 26/5/2022 on costs and the same be paid by the 1
st
 Respondent
iii.
The costs of the application be provided for.






2.
The Application was supported by the affidavit of David Muriithi Kababi on the grounds that:
a.
The 2
nd
 Respondent is now required to bear costs arising from a process conducted by the 1
st
 Respondent
b.
It is only fair that since the inquiry report was prepared by the office of the 1
st
 Respondent, the Sacco should not be apportioned any liability as a cost.
c.
The Tribunal having faulted the inquiry process which the Sacco had no role in the manner it was conducted it would only be fair that the 1
st
 Respondent be apportioned the sole responsibility of bearing the costs.
This Tribunal on 31
st
 July, 2023 gave directions for the parties to be served with further directions given on 6
th
 February 2024 for the Application to be canvassed by written submissions.






3.
The Claimant filed his written submissions indicating among other that there was inordinate delay in filing the application and that the 2
nd
 Respondent has not demonstrated as to whether the order for costs which is discretionary, was made unjudicially, and as such the application does not meet the threshold for review and should be dismissed.
The 2
nd
 Respondent on their hand argued that this Tribunal did not find them culpable of any wrong doing and their role in the inquiry leading to the surcharge was to avail information and documents and as such they did not participate in any decision making in the surcharge that has successfully been appealed against.
It is also their argument that they are not asking the Tribunal to reverse its findings but rather to offer clarity on who between the Respondents should bear the costs as the error is on the face of the record, and is self-evident.
We have considered the written submissions and the application, and the only question remaining for determination is as to whether there is need for this Tribunal to review it findings and/or correct the error apparent.
Should the Tribunal review its findings and/or correct the error apparent? Courts jurisdiction to review their own judgments and/or findings and orders are exercised within the framework of Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 as read with Order 45 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Section 80 gives the power of review while order 45 Rule 1 sets out the rules.






4.
The two legal instruments above, restrict the grounds for review by essentially laying down the jurisdiction and scope of review to:
i.
Discovery of new and important matter of evidence which after exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order made.
ii.
On account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or
iii.
For any other sufficient reason as long as the application is made without unreasonable delay
It is important to note that a review may be granted whenever the court considers if necessary to correct an apparent error or omission on the part of the court when such an error or omission is self-evident and does not require an elaborate argument to establish.
In this particular case, it is self-evident that there is an apparent error on record as this Tribunal was not specific as to which Respondent should bear the cost. This error is prima facie visible and does not require any elaborate argument to establish and as such this Tribunal has made the decision to review its orders as to costs.






5.
In the interest of justice, this Tribunal reviews its discretion as to costs and orders that all parties to bear their own costs. We are persuaded that this is the most equitable thing to do, as the Claimant or Appellant did also not succeed in all the prayers he brought before this Tribunal.


Upshot
Application Notice of Motion dated 8/11/2022 is found to be with merit.
The judgment of the Tribunal dated 26/5/2022 is reviewed on issue of costs– all parties will bear their own costs.
File closed.

h.
That O.C.S. Ruiru/Runda Police Station does enforce compliance of this order.
i.
That the costs of this application be provided for.






2.
The application is based on the grounds thereunder and is supported by the affidavit of Peter Mwenda Njagi sworn on 24
th
 April 2024.
The grounds of the are inter alia …….
a.
That on 11
th
 April, 2024 agents of the 2
nd
 Respondent/Auctioneers proclaimed office items electronics and furniture in the Maisonette located on Plot No. Block 110/J91 along Northern Bypass in Thome area of Nairobi and left a proclamation Notice of seven (7) days.
b.
That upon the said Proclamation the application filed an application dated 19/4/2024 seeking injunctive orders supported inadvertently by an unsigned affidavit.
c.
That on 19
th
 April, 2024 the Tribunal directed the applicant to serve all parties with the said application dated 19
th

th
 April, 2024, which he seeks to have admitted as evidence in lieu of unsigned Affidavit that was filed with the said application dated 19
th
 April, 2024.
The deponent reiterates the grounds of the application and states further the Applicant is distinct person from both the decree- holder and he judgement- debtor, that the applicant is a businessman and stands to suffer irreparable injury if the property is attached.






4.
In response to the Notice of Motion application dated 24
th
 April, 2024, the 1
st
 Respondent /Decree- Holder filed her Replying affidavit sworn on 7
th
 May, 2024. The 1
st
 Respondent states that the 2
nd
 Respondent did not find the Applicants premises, but acted within the ambit of the Law as per the warrants of attachment of movable property in execution of the decree issued on 26
th
 February, 2024.
That the 2
nd
 Respondent acted on the information from an investigator. The 3
rd
 Respondent carries on business on the said Plot No. Block 110/J91, that the applicant is operating as a representative and /or agent of the Judgment - Debtor who is hiding behind the applicant to avoid execution of the warrants of attachment of movable property in execution of the lease.
That the applicant portrays himself to the public as a worker and/or Agent of the 3
rd
 Respondents, that the auctioneer did not interfere with the applicants’ enjoyment and possession of the rented property but instead regularly and lawfully proclaimed the Applicants office furniture and goods that the Applicants tenancy agreement is neither dated nor witnessed, that the receipt for the alleged purchased items in the applicants alleged purchase from Muthokinju does not bear the applicants’ name, that the receipt for purchase of items from Odds and Ends on receipts dated 2/7/2020 is addressed to a third party entity, that the alleged purchases by the applicant took place in filing 2020 long before the alleged tenancy took place that the 1
st
 Respondent to suffer irreparable damage, that if the attachment is not allowed, it will be difficult to trace the 3
rd
 Respondent, that the applicant’ application dated 24
th
 April, 2024 has no merit and is an abuse of the court process calculated to circumvent the Tribunal’s warrant of Attachment.






Analysis and Determination


5.
We have considered the Notice of Motion Application and Affidavit in support thereof; we have also considered the Replying Affidavit of the 1
st
 Respondent/Decree- holder observe and find as follows: -
1.
That the affidavit in support of the Notice Motion Application dated 24
th
 April, 2024 is the supporting affidavit sworn on Peter Mwenda Njagi on 24
th
 April, 2024.
2.
That the affidavit of the applicant sworn on 19
th
 April, 2024 is not really an annexure to the Applicant’s application dated 24
th
 April, 2024 and not an affidavit in support thereof; hence it is not mentioned in evidence.
3.
That the Applicant’s application dated 19
th
 April, 2024 was withdrawn on the 30
th
 April, 2024.
4.
The affidavit in support of the Applicant’s application has not adduced any evidence to prove ownership by the applicant of the proclaimed goods; similarly, the 1
st
 respondent has not demonstrated that indeed the goods proclaimed in the said house belonged to the 3
rd
 Respondent or that indeed, the premises were 3
rd
 Respondent’s Lawful premises for purposes of execution.
5.
That despite the statement of the 1
st
 Respondent that her Auctioneer relied on the information of an investigator in deciding to proclaim the goods in the applicant’s premises, no evidence has been adduced to prove the investigation took place and to counter the applicant’s statement that the said house on Plot No. Block 110/J91 was her rental premises.
6.
That it is not enough for the 1
st
 Respondent to say that the applicant portrays herself to the public as the worker or marketer of the 3
rd
 Respondent and hence the premises rented by her must be the business premises of 3
rd
 Respondent. We therefore must conclude that no prove has been provided, before this Tribunal that the movable property proclaimed by the 2
nd
 Respondent on 1
st
 April, 2024 belong to the 3
rd
 Respondent.






7.
In the upshot, we hold that the Applicant’s Application dated 24/4/2024 is merited on ground that a proclamation in execution of a Decree must be undertaken Lawfully and devoid of presumption and/or hearsay.
Consequently, we order as follows”-
1.
Prayers 1,2,3,4 and 5 of the application are spent.
2.
Prayers 6,7 and 8 of the application are allowed:
a.
That upon hearing of this application inter-parte, this Honourable Tribunal be pleased to issue an interim Order of injunction restraining the Respondents, their employees, servants and/or agents from attaching the Applicants property contained in Plot Block 110/591 situated along Northern Bypass in Thome Area Nairobi in execution of the decree of this court.
b.
That upon hearing of this application inter-parte, this Honourable Tribunal be pleased to issue an interim order of injunction restraining the Respondents, their employees, servants and/or agents from attaching the Applicants property in execution of the decree of this court as per the Proclamation notice dated the 11
th
 day of April, 2024 by High Class Auctioneers pending the hearing of this application inter-partes
c.
That O.C.S. Ruiru/Runda Police Station does enforce compliance of this order.


3.
The costs of the Application are granted to the Applicant.








4.
File ordered as closed.

Ruling










1.
The applicant filed the notice of motion dated 15
th
 July 2024 seeking revision of the orders of the trial magistrate denying him bond/bail. The application is supported by an affidavit sworn by the applicant of even date.






2.
The averments made are that he was denied bail/bond by virtue of being a flight risk. He is a family man with a permanent fixed abode within the court’s jurisdiction. He will not interfere with witnesses. He has sureties who are willing to ensure that he attends court. He urged the court to revise the decision of the trial court.






3.
I have considered the application, the decision of the trial court and the applicable law.






4.
Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code which has been invoked by the Applicant empowers this court to call for and examine the record of any criminal proceedings before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality, or propriety of any finding or order recorded and the regularity of any proceedings of any such subordinate court. The actions that this court can take when exercising its revisionary jurisdiction are provided for under Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






5.
Be that as it may, this application is founded on bail or bond and therefore, article 49(1) (h) of 
the Constitution
 as well as Section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code are relevant. Section 123 A specifically provides;
“
subject to Article 49 (1) (h) of 
the Constitution
 and notwithstanding section 123 in making a decision on bail and bond the court shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances in particular nature and seriousness of the offence, the character, antecedents, association, and community ties of the accused person the defendants record in respect of the fulfilment of obligations under previous grants of bail the strength of the chance of his having committed the offence.""






6.
I have examined the record of the trial court. I note that the after the applicant was denied bail on 11
th
 June 2024 on the grounds that he was a flight risk. It is trite law that the paramount principle to be considered in granting bail, is to secure the attendance of the accused during trial.






7.
In this case, the trial court found that the applicant was a flight risk and his attendance could not be secured if released on bail/bond. Bail being discretionary, the trial court considered the circumstances of the case, and issued appropriate orders denying him bail.






8.
The trial court was within its mandate to deny bail/bond if there were compelling reasons. In this case, the trial court found that the appellant being a flight risk was a compelling reason. Hence, I find nothing in the record of the lower court to show an illegality, irregularity, or impropriety to warrant review of the orders of the lower court.






9.
The upshot of the above is that the application is dismissed for lacking in merit.




Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
This file was opened for purposes of considering whether the convict Rosemary Wesonga Wakhisi is suitable for consideration of her sentence review in the spirit of prison decongestion pursuant to the Chief Justice Memo dated 7
th
 December 2022.






2.
The applicant was convicted for the offence of trafficking in narcotic drugs contrary to section 4(a) of the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act
 No. 4 of 1994. She was 10 years imprisonment in addition to paying a fine in default to serve an additional 1 year.






3.
According to the Recommendation Report from prison dated 7

4.
In view of the foregoing, it is my finding that the applicant is eligible for early release as the both the Probation and Prison Reports found in his favour. This, in my view, is sufficient sentence served by the applicant.

Michael Kinyua Muturi


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the decision of Honourable Resident Magistrate E.Soita in Nakuru CMCR Sexual Offences Case No. E006 of 2022 delivered on 29th July, 2024)
        
      






Ruling










1.
The Appellant/Applicant moved Court vide Notice of Motion Application dated 18
th
 September, 2024 under Section 357 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking the following orders: -
a.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to grant extension of time to file the Petition of Appeal out of time;
b.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to release the applicant herein Micheal Kinyua Muturi on bail pending the hearing of the appeal;
c.
That alternatively, this Honourable Court be pleased to suspend the execution of the sentence imposed on the appellant pending the hearing and determination of this Appeal
d.
That the Petition herein be deemed as filed out of time.






2.
The Application was premised on the grounds on the face of the Application, that;
i.
the Appeal has an overwhelming chance of succeeding;
ii.
the Applicant never violated the bail terms throughout trial;
iii.
the Applicant has a young family and thus the bread winner;
iv.
the sentence was not proven beyond reasonable doubt;
v.
the sentence was not founded in law; and
vi.
the delay is not inordinate and it is the interest of justice that the accused be allowed to be heard and prove his innocence.






3.
The Application was supported by the sworn Affidavit Mr. Okumu Ong’ang’o, Counsel for the Applicant. He averred that the Applicant was found guilty on 29
th
 July, 2024 and is currently serving his sentence but has fallen ill in prison with his health deteriorating pending hearing of the appeal and extension of time to file the annexed Petition of Appeal.






4.
That the Applicant was out on bond throughout the trial process and never violated the bond terms and therefore in the interest of fairness and justice the prayers sought should be allowed.






5.
The Respondent opposed the Application vide the undated Replying Affidavit sworn by Ms. Monica Mburu, state counsel, wherein she deposed that bail pending hearing and determination of an appeal is a right that is not absolute.






6.
It was the Respondents case that, no exceptional or unusual circumstances have been demonstrated where the interests of justice would favour granting bail pending appeal. Further that there has been no demonstration that the appeal has high chances of succeeding by a draft Petition of Appeal or otherwise any substantial question of fact and or law that is arguable on appeal.






7.
It was her argument that, the appeal has no prospects of succeeding as the ingredients for proof of the offence of defilement were established hence the conviction meted. It was her argument further that the Applicant poses as a flight risk and the mare fact the bail terms were not breached is not enough to warrant bail pending appeal. Further, that falling sick was not reason enough since he is receiving treatment at Nakuru County Referral and Teaching Hospital facilitated by the government.






8.
The Application proceeded orally on 25
th
 September, 2024






Applicant’s Submissions


9.
Through Mr. Okumu it was submitted that issues raised on appeal can only be argued substantively. That what is on consideration is bail pending appeal and the application is grounded on the deteriorating health is the Applicant whereby granting him bail will enable him seek medical attention.






10.
That is as much as the Applicant has access to medical attention, is not adequate. That he has a problem with the prison diet as when he feeds, he vomits which counsel asserted to have witnessed, and it is draining his parents to provide alternative diet. That his incarceration risks his right to life thereby infringing his right to life under Article 26 of 
the Constitution
.






11.
Counsel relied on the decisions in R vs Danson Mugunga & Another and R v Diana Suleiman Said wherein the Courts emphasized on the Right to bail under Article 49 (1) (h). That yes arguability of the appeal is an important element, it does not have to be meritorious. The Applicant is yet to be proved guilty on appeal.






12.
At the Court seeking clarity as to the sentence imposed by the trial Court which was not disclosed in the pleadings, and the sentence ruling was neither attached to the motion the Applicant Counsel Stated that the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment imposed is harsh and maximum and, in the appeal, it is contended that it was not safe to hand him a maximum sentence when all the elements were to be proven.






13.
That the sentence is not a reason for the Applicant not to appear in Court and that the Court has powers to enforce conditions to ensure attendance in Court or impose conditions for non-interference with the case. That in as much as it is 20-year sentence, the seriousness of the charge is not a ground unless the appeal is heard and determined.








Respondent’s Case


14.
On behalf of the state, Ms. Mburu submitted that the Applicant is convict for the offence of defilement and as such does not enjoy the right to bail under Article 49 (1) (h) of 
the Constitution
 which right is available to arrested persons. He does not enjoy the right of presumption of innocence nor does the intention to appeal or has an appeal afford him the presumption. That as a convict, the Appellate Court is to confirm or otherwise.






15.
That considering the severity of the sentence, the Applicant poses as a flight risk and the Court has no guarantee that is he is released he shall avail himself.






16.
That Section 351 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for bail pending appeal and it provided that the Court may release one on bail. The wording “may” is not mandatory and the right is not absolute and can only be granted in exercise of discretion. That the discretion will be informed by the circumstances of the case on a case-to-case basis.






17.
Reliance was placed in Court of Appeal case of Jivaj Shah vs Republic (1986)] KLR where the Court stated that:
there must be exceptional or unusual circumstances upon which the Court can conclude that it is in the interests of justice to grant bail if it appears prima facie from the totality of the circumstance that the appeal is likely to be successful on account of substantial point of law to be argued or that the sentence or substantially part of it may have served before the appeal is heard.






18.
Ms. Mburu summitted on three points in refence to the above cited authority. Firstly, it was submitted that a substantial part of the sentence has also not been served an if the Court deems it fit can prioritize the appeal.






19.
Secondly on whether the appeal is likely to be successful on account of substantial point of law to be argued, it was submitted that a draft Petition for Appeal has not be sited and that the judgment has no substantial point of law arguable since the entire evidence was considered and the Court was satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. To this end it was submitted that the appeal has no chance of success.






20.
Thirdly on exceptional or unusual circumstances, it was submitted that, there was none, since a health ground is not one warranting release on bail pending appeal. the annextures portray that the Applicant has received treatment in a hospital well equipped with trained personnel and equipment and the medical notes reveal the exhaustive services he has received therefore there is no other better facility. He has a right to continue accessing treatment while serving his sentence. There is no evidence regarding the diet issue.








Rebuttal


21.
On the issue of the Applicant being a flight risk Mr. Okumu submitted that, the Applicant religiously attended Court and never absconded. That there was no interference with prosecution witnesses and going by that record he is seeks to be released on medical reasons.






22.
On the issue of appeal lacking points of law, it was submitted that Ground No. 1 has a point of law. That any period served shall occasion injustice should the appeal be successful.






23.
On the issue of diet Mr. Okumu argued that the Court has discretion to interrogate and hear from the Applicant on the difficulty he is facing with the diet provided for in prison.






24.
Mr Okumu Advocate was granted leave by the Court to file a supplementary Affidavit strictly deponing and evidencing the actual medical condition of the Applicant that would necessitate being released on bail pending Appeal as an exceptional circumstance.






25.
It is noteworthy that, by the time of writing this ruling, the Applicant was yet to seize the moment to further demonstrate his unique health condition as an exceptional factor.








Analysis and Determination


26.
Whereas the Applicant has postured that, the Right to Bail is unfettered even after conviction, this Court respectfully declines such an argument noting that the legal inference as to the Judgment made or sentence imposed, being contested on Appeal is that, of “legality of sentence” and judgment” until reversed or confirmed by the appellate Court.






27.
The Applicant is a convict and by dint of the case of Masrani v R [1060] EA 321, he is subject to different principles as was held that: -
“
Different principles must apply after conviction. The accused person has then become a convicted person and the sentence starts to run from the date of his conviction.”






28.
This Court concurs with the position in the case of Charles Owanga Aluoch v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] eKLR where it was held that: -
“
The right to bail is provided under Article 49(1) of 
the Constitution
 but is at the discretion of the Court, and is not absolute. Bail is a constitutional right where one is awaiting trial. After conviction that right is at the Court’s discretion and upon considering the circumstances of the application. The Courts have over the years formulated several principles and guidelines upon which bail pending appeal is anchored. In the case of Jiv Raji Shah vs. R [1966] KLR 605, the principle considerations for granting bail pending appeal were stated as follows:
“(1)
The principal consideration in an application for bond pending appeal is the existence of exceptional or unusual circumstances upon which the Court of Appeal can fairly conclude that it is in the interest of justice to grant bail.
(2)
If it appears prima face from the totality of the circumstances that the appeal is likely to be successful on account of some substantial point of law to be argued and that the sentence or substantial part of it will have been served by the time the appeal is heard, conditions for granting bail exists.
(3)
The main criteria is that, there is no difference between overwhelming chances of success and a set of circumstances which disclose substantial merit in the appeal which could result in the appeal being allowed and the proper approach is the consideration of the particular circumstances and weight and relevance of the points to be argued.”






29.
This Court is further bound by the case of Dominic Karanja v Republic (1986) KLR 612 where the Court of Appeal stated that:-
“
(a)
The most important issue was that if the appeal had such overwhelming chances of success, there is no justification for depriving the applicant of his liberty and the minor relevant considerations would be whether there were exceptional or unusual circumstances;
(b)
The previous good character of the applicant and the hardships if any facing his family were not exceptional or unusual factors. Ill health per se would also not constitute an exceptional circumstance where there existed medical facilities for prisoners;
(c)
A solemn assertion by an applicant that he will not abscond if released, even if it is supported by sureties, is not sufficient ground for releasing a convicted person on bail pending appeal;
(d)
…………..”






30.
This Court has considered the decisions above on whose basis point that, it is the discretion of the Court to grant bail pending appeal, which discretion should be exercised judiciously. In such an application, the Applicant has the burden of establishing that the appeal has high chances of success or has a high likelihood of serving a substantial part of the sentence before hearing the appeal.






31.
While the Applicant contends that the issues raised on appeal can only be argued substantively and that in the application, only judgment of the trial Court was availed but not the proceedings nor sentence. This Court was not in a position to peruse the record to establish whether an arguable appeal with high chances of success have been disclosed by the grounds of appeal.






32.
The Burden of showcasing that the Appeal stands overwhelming chances of success was upon the Applicant which burden has not been discharged.






33.
The Applicant was duty bound to further expound and evidence the unique circumstance in this case the health situation a condition that this Court is unable to state or identify, as the Applicant never filed and medical examination report to detail whatever condition it was and that the attached exhibits were various receipts for heath services and treatment notes all from the Nakuru PG Hospital. The Applicant had two failed opportunities to further showcase this factor.






34.
I am of the considered view that the Applicant has been accessing treatment at the government Nakuru P G H where the prison services refer their cases to and where the Applicant shall continue accessing treatment even whilst serving his sentence






35.
The Applicant was sentenced on 29
th
 July 2014 to a twenty (20) years imprisonment. Therefore, there is no likelihood of him having served a substantial part of the sentence before the appeal is heard. The current policy of quick disposal of cases does not create the possibility of delay in hearing of the appeal.






36.
The Applicant has not demonstrated the existence of exceptional or unusual circumstance to warrant grant of bail pending appeal. The fact that the Applicant did not breach bail conditions in the Trial Court, has a young family and thus the bread winner are not exceptional circumstances to warrant admission to bail pending appeal.






37.
In conclusion, this Court finds no merit in the application dated 18
th
 September 2024 and is therefore dismissed. Hearing of the appeal be fixed on a priority basis upon preparation of a record of Appeal.
It is so ordered.

Jackson Mutinda Mutua

Republic


 


Respondent










Ruling










1.
The applicant was charged and convicted for the offence of kidnapping contrary to section 257 as read with 256 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to serve five (5) years imprisonment.






2.
He filed an undated notice of motion received on 15
th
 July 2024 seeking revision of sentence. He filed an affidavit in support of his motion. The arguments raised are that the trial court failed to consider the time she spent in remand custody during the computation of sentence under the provision of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 of the Laws of Kenya.






3.
I have considered the application, the affidavit in support and the applicable law. I have also considered the trial court record. The issue for consideration is whether the trial court considered the time the applicant spent in remand custody.






4.
The proviso to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to consider the time already spent in custody during sentencing. The court has a duty to take into account the period an accused person had remained in custody during sentencing under the proviso to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which is couched in mandatory terms. This was acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs. Republic [2018] eKLR and Bethwel Wilson Kibor vs. Republic [2009] eKLR and more recently in the High Court case of Vincent Sila Jona & 87 others vs Kenya Prison Service & 2 others [2021] eKLR.






5.
It is therefore clear that it is mandatory that the period which an accused has been held in custody prior to being sentenced be considered in meting out the sentence where it is not hindered by other provisions of the law.






6.
From the record, the applicant was arrested on 19
th
 September 2021 and was never released on bail/bond. He was convicted on 16
th
 December 2022. He, therefore, spent one (1) year and three (3) months in remand custody. From the record, that the period was not factored in during his sentencing by the trial court.






7.
In Ahmed Abolfathi Mohamed v Republic (supra) the Court of Appeal held as follows;
“
Taking into account” the period spent in custody must mean considering that period so that the imposed sentence is reduced proportionately by the period already spent in custody. It is not enough for the court to merely state that it has taken into account the period already spent in custody and still order the sentence to run from the date of the conviction because that amounts to ignoring altogether the period already spent in custody. It must be remembered that the proviso to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was introduced in 2007 to give the court power to include the period already spent in custody in the sentence that it metes out to the accused person. We find that the first appellate court misdirected itself in that respect and should have directed the appellant’s sentence of imprisonment to run from the date of arrest on 19th June 2012.”






8.
Guided by the law, the court is of the view that the application ought to be considered, as failure to do so would amount to denying the applicant a right due to the failure of the court to discharge an obligation bestowed upon it by law.






9.
I thus allow the application and order that the sentence of five (5) years imprisonment shall be run from 19
th
 September 2021 the date of the appellant’s arrest pursuant to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 Laws of Kenya.
Orders accordingly.

Ruling










1.
On 21/8/2024, this court delivered judgment finding the two accused herein Abisaye Odongo Nyaoke alias “Siaya”and Sylvester Oyoo Ogada, jointly guilty of the murder of Kevin Onyango Abuto alias Dadi and convicted the two accused persons for the said murder as charged under section 203 of the Penal Code.






2.
The principal Prosecution Counsel, Mr. Marete submitted that the prosecution had no previous criminal records on the convicts and therefore they should be treated as first offenders.






3.
The Court then allowed both convicts to mitigate through their counsel Ms Awuor holding brief for Mr. Sala and in their own words. Ms Awuor intimated to court that the convicts would each mitigate in their own words which they did.






4.
In his own words, the 1
st
 convict Abisaye Odongo Nyaoke alias Siaya stated as follows in Kiswahili:
“
I ask the court to help me. I have been attending court sessions since the commencement of the case. I am 31 years old. I am married with 2 children. I am a bodaboda rider.”






5.
The 2
nd
 Accused Sylvester Oyoo Ogada mitigated in Dholuo language interpreted by Court Assistant Mr. Osir as follows:
“
I pray for leniency of the court. I have been attending court since I was released on bond. I am aged 25 years old, unmarried. I am a mason. My father died, my mother is alive”.






6.
After the mitigations, Ms. Awuor, their counsel stated as follows: “That is all we wish to state in mitigation.”






7.
Upon hearing the mitigation by the two convicts, I observed that the deceased’s family was not present to give Victim Impact Statement. I noted that the convicts were youths and young persons at the time of committing the offence in this 2019 case.






8.
I directed that for this court to mete out sentence or punishment that is fair and just, a pre-sentence report to be filed by the Probation Officer within 14 days, which report was to include the Victim Impact Statement. Pending the presentencing report, the bonds for the two convicts were suspended until 12
th
 September 2024.






9.
As this court was to be engaged in an official function on 12
th
 September, I issued Notice to parties to appear earlier on 11
th
 September for presentencing report and a production order was issued for the two convicts.






10.
On 11
th
 September, 2024, Helida Atieno Abuto, the mother to the deceased was in court. She was sworn and she gave her victim impact statement stating that she had testified in this case as PW1 and that the deceased Kevin Onyango Abuto is my first-born son. She stated that she had been interviewed by the Probation Officer for Presentence Report. She then stated as follows:
“
I wish to state that the 2 accused are people from my village. I wish if it is possible, and my heart desires that I forgive them. I have forgiven them and that is what I have to say.”






11.
Mr. Marete, Principal Prosecution Counsel on behalf of the State submitted that he had perused the two presentence reports filed by Mr. Otieno the Probation officer. That he was not convinced that the accused are remorseful. He was concerned that the conclusion of the report was that the offence was not premeditated which is not a factor in sentencing as a life was lost by Kevin Onyango Abuto.






12.
Counsel invited this court to look at what the accused said in the report on circumstances of the offence where they still claimed that they did not cause grievous harm to the deceased and alleged that he was assaulted by other people. He pointed out that the accused did not acknowledge committing the offence hence they will not acknowledge or appreciate the rehabilitation process.






13.
Mr. Marete submitted that the Probation report failed to capture a proper Victim Impact Assessment of the deceased, his age and the psycho—social impact his death and whether he had any prospects. He stated that the report sounded like the death of the deceased had no impact at all.






14.
On the people allegedly interviewed by the Probation Officer, it was submitted that we are not told who is this administrator the Probation Officer spoke to and his rank and which community members he spoke to.






15.
Counsel submitted that nobody has to die so that there are cordial relations in the society. He wondered aloud why, after conviction, parties are said to have healed yet someone had died. he urged the court to be guided by Article 27 (1) and (4) of 
the Constitution
 on the principle of equality before the law, not to discriminate during sentencing, based on the Probation report which according to him, gives extraneous factors which are diversionary of the real issue of the offence of murder.






16.
The prosecution prayed for a formal declaration that the consequences of the acts of the two convicts is death which is still available in law as was observed by the Supreme Court in the Francis Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017]e KLR case.






17.
The Prosecution further prayed that in the event of an imprisonment term, the Court should impose a term where the objectives of criminal law will be attained through the imposition of appropriate, adequate, just and proportionate sentence commensurate to the nature and gravity of the offence and how it was committed. Counsel referred to the evidence of PW6 on the nature of injuries which were sustained by the deceased all over his body, including fractures. He maintained that the murder of the deceased Kevin was intentional and that the 2 convicts reflected on their intentions before committing the offence and achieved their desired consequences.






18.
Finally, Counsel for the prosecution submitted that appropriate sentence will impact directly on crime control which will have a direct correlation to fostering an environment where human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims are respected, referring to Clause 1.2 of the Judiciary Policy Sentencing Guidelines.






19.
On behalf of the two convicts, Mr. Sala counsel for the convicts submitted that the evidence and presentencing report show that the murder was not premeditated. That the 2 convicts acknowledge the offence and are remorseful. That the very unique circumstances of this case call for non-custodial supervised reintegration into the society as appropriate punishment.






20.
Counsel for the convicts submitted that the Probation Officer interviewed all the relevant parties and the local administration and the community and that not even one person has cast aspersions or raised a finger against a lighter sentence against the 2 convicts.






21.
Counsel submitted that the two convicts were good friends with the deceased and enjoy a cordial relationship with the family of the deceased, not just after conviction. That they acknowledge the gravity of the offence which they are remorseful about and prayed for inherent discretion to give lenient sentence.






22.
He submitted that the deceased’s mother on her own volition had attended all court sessions and had sworn to have forgiven the accused persons; and that being the closest family member to the deceased, she would have had misgivings.






23.
Following the lengthy submissions on sentencing, I reserved the matter for sentencing today.






24.
I have considered the circumstances under which the offence was committed, the mitigations, victim impact statement by the deceased’s mother and the pre-sentence reports on each of the two convicts coupled with the serious submissions by the prosecution and the defence counsel.






25.
From the onset, the two convicts herein denied committing the offence and even in their mitigations, they never acknowledged that they committed the offence. They simply stated of how they had attended court sessions faithfully until the end and prayed for leniency of the court in sentencing. The 1
st
 convict was prodded by the court as to his age and whether he was married with children is when he admitted saying he was aged 31 years, married with two children and a bodaboda rider. The 2
nd
 convict reiterated what his co-convict stated save that he was unmarried and was aged 25 years, his father died, his mother was alive and that he was a mason.






26.
The presentence reports reveal that the convicts had never been in conflict with the law before and that they are cousins, with their families having reconciled with the deceased’s family as their cousin had bought land from the deceased’s family. That the deceased’s family was forgiving and had forgiven them, reiterating what the deceased’s mother had given on oath and that lenient sentence was desirable due to the reconciliatory mood of forgiving the offenders/ convicts herein.






27.
Under section 204 of the Penal code, punishment for murder, upon conviction is death. However, the discretion in sentencing vests in the trial judge because the trial court had the opportunity to see and hear evidence from both the prosecution witnesses and the defence and therefore observe their conduct and behaviour. That discretion must however be exercised judiciously and not capriciously. In African Continents Bank V Nuamani [1991] NWLI 486, the Court stated that:
“
The exercise of court’s discretion is said to be judicial if the judge invokes the power in his capacity as a judge qua law. An exercise of discretionary power will be said to be judicial, if the power is exercised in accordance with the enabling statutes, discretionary power is said to be judicious if it arises or conveys the intellectual wisdom or prudent intellectual capacity of the judge. The exercise must be based on a sound and sensible judgment with a view to doing justice to the parties.”






28.
The question is what would constitute an adequate, appropriate and just sentence in the circumstances of this case? The Supreme Court in Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another vs Republic, Petition No. 15 of 2015, guided on sentencing and stated as follows:
“
…the following guidelines with regard to mitigating factors are applicable in a re-hearing sentence for the conviction of a murder charge:a.age of the offender b.being a first offender;c.whether the offender pleaded guilty;d.character and record of the offender;e.commission of the offence in response to gender-based violence;f.remorsefulness of the offender;g.the possibility of reform and social re-adaptation of the offender;h.any other factor that the Court considers relevant.”






29.
The apex Court in the above Muruatetu Case appreciated that:
“
In Kenya, many courts have highlighted the principles of sentencing. One such case is the High Court criminal appeal decision in Dahir Hussein v. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 2015; [2015] eKLR, where the High Court held that the objectives include: “deterrence, rehabilitation, accountability for one’s actions, society protection, retribution and denouncing the conduct by the offender on the harm done to the victim.”






30.
On the other hand, the 2016 Judiciary of Kenya Sentencing Policy Guidelines lists the objectives of sentencing at page 15, paragraph 4.1 as follows:
“
Sentences are imposed to meet the following objectives:1.Retribution: To punish the offender for his/her criminal conduct in a just manner.2.Deterrence: To deter the offender from committing a similar offence subsequently as well as to discourage other people from committing similar offences.3.Rehabilitation: To enable the offender reform from his criminal disposition and become a law abiding person.4.Restorative justice: To address the needs arising from the criminal conduct such as loss and damages. Criminal conduct ordinarily occasions victims’, communities’ and offenders’ needs and justice demands that these are met. Further, to promote a sense of responsibility through the offender’s contribution towards meeting the victims’ needs.5.Community protection: To protect the community by incapacitating the offender.6.Denunciation: To communicate the community’s condemnation of the criminal conduct.”






31.
I have considered the circumstances of this case, where the deceased was hacked to death for reasons known to the accused persons herein as the theory advanced that he was mobbed for being a thief could not sell. Even if it were the case that he was a thief, there are legal means of dealing with thieves. Killing them mercilessly is not one of those methods of punishing thieves. I have also considered the mitigations, submissions by both counsel and the victim impact statement; and given equal consideration to the objects of sentencing as stated in the Kenya Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guideline and as summarised in the Francis Muruatetu & Anther vs Republic [2017] eKLR decision, which guidelines and principles are relevant in so far as sentencing and re-sentencing in murder cases is concerned. I have further considered the fact that the convicts are first time offenders and they committed the offence when they were young; they are both under 35 years old; Further noting that in their own words in mitigation, they did not show any remorse, until their counsel Mr Sala mitigated only after the pre-sentence report was filed and from which report, the convicts were very evasive, blaming other people for the death of the deceased.






32.
I further observe that the mother to the deceased testified stating that she had forgiven the convicts, which may be so, although the convicts did not plead guilty to the charge and neither did they plea bargain for a lesser charge and or sentence. There is also no evidence that the convicts herein expressed remorse to the family of the Deceased or in any way sought reconciliation. If it were so, nothing prevented them from expressly saying so in court and to the deceased’s mother who was present in court. The deceased’s mother did not say that the convicts had expressed remorse to her. She only said that she forgives them.






33.
As correctly stated by Mr. Marete for the Prosecution, the presentence report gives abstract statements of people allegedly interviewed without specifying which specific community leaders were interviewed. It also talks of a murder not premeditated when there is no legal requirement for motive to be proved in criminal cases.






34.
It is now well settled law that sentence must reflect the accused’s blameworthiness for the offence. See Omuse vs R (2009) KLR 214, where it was held that the sentence imposed on an accused person must be commensurate to the moral blameworthiness of the offender and that the proper exercise of discretion in sentencing requires the Court to consider that fact and circumstances of the case in their entirety before settling for any given sentence.






35.
No person has any right to take away the life of another except in situations of absolute self-defence or defence of property or as provided for under the law and 
the Constitution
.






36.
The prosecution asked for a declaration of death sentence, which is lawful punishment under section 204 of the Penal Code and as reiterated by the Supreme Court in the Muruatetu(supra) case. The defence on the other hand sought for lenient non-custodial sentence.






37.
In the circumstances of this case, I find a non-custodial sentence as sought by the convicts to be inappropriate. The accused persons need to feel the consequences of the crime they committed. A custodial sentence will rehabilitate them and send a warning to others that it does not pay to take law into one’s hands and that violence do not pay at all. Further, that all lives matter; live and let live.






38.
Thus, this Court has to balance between the need to have the accused atone for their actions and the need to exercise leniency, given the circumstances of the case as described above. In this regard, I think that a shorter custodial sentence is appropriate. and within the range of sentences meted out in similar cases.






39.
Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, and taking into account the Muruatetu sentencing guidelines in murder cases, the fact of the accused convicts being young people, first offenders and the objects and purposes of sentencing, I hereby exercise discretion and sentence each of the convicts herein Abisaye Odongo Nyaoke alias Siaya and Sylvester Oyoo Ogada to each serve fifteen (15) years imprisonment for the murder of Kevin Onyango Abuto alia Dadi. The imprisonment term for each of the convicts herein shall take into account the provisions of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in that the period that the two convicts have spent in custody following their conviction on 21/8/2024 to 1/10/2024 date of sentencing when their bonds were suspended and and from the date of their arrest on 15/1/2019 until their release on bond pending trial shall be considered as part of the prison term. For avoidance of doubt, the convicts were arrested on 15/1/2019 and were released on bond on 5
th
 April 2019 in the case of the 2
nd
 convict Sylvester Oyoo Ogada and on 9
th
 April, 2019 in the case of the 1
st
 convict Abisaye Odongo Nyaoke alias Siaya.






40.
Right of Appeal explained, 14 days of today to the Court of Appeal is guaranteed.

Ruling










A. Introduction


1.
The applicant was charged with the offence of obtaining money by false pretences contrary to section 313 of the penal code, resisting arrest by a police officer in due execution of duty contrary to section 103(a) of the 
National police service Act
 and on count three was charged with the offence of Assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 251 of the penal code. The applicant was convicted on his own plea of guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of Kshs.20,000/= or in default to serve six (6) months in default on count one, on count two he was fined Kshs.100,000/= or in default to serve two years imprisonment and on count three he was fined Kshs.50,000/= and in default to serve one (1) year imprisonment. The sentences were to run consecutively.






2.
Through this application, the applicant seeks that the court be pleased to review the fine and sentence imposed, taking into account that he was a casual labourer, and the current prevailing economic environment which made it difficult for him to raise the hefty fines imposed. The respondent’s counsel opposed this application and did submit that based on the evidence adduced before the trial court, the conviction and sentence of the applicant, was proper and lawful thus and there was no need to interfere with the same.








C. Analysis of Law


3.
I have considered the application by the applicant as well as the response by the state counsel/ODPP. The powers of the High court in revision are contained in Section 362 through to 366 of the Criminal Procedure Code (cap.75). Section 362 specifically provides as follows: -
“
The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceedings before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of any such subordinate court”.






4.
What the High Court can do under its revision jurisdiction is stated under Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code( Cap 75), which states as follows: -
“
(1)
in the case of a proceeding in a subordinate court the record of which has been called for or which has been reported for orders, or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, the High court may –
(a)
in the case of a conviction, exercise any of the powers conferred on it as a court of appeal by section 354, 357 and 358, and may enhance sentence;.
(b)
in the case of any other order than an order of acquittal, alter or reverse the order.
(2)
No order under this section shall be made to the prejudiced of an accused person unless he had had an opportunity of being heard either personally or through an advocate in his own defence. Provided that this subsection shall not apply to an order made where a subordinate court has failed to pass a sentence which it was required to pass under the written law creating the offence concerned.
(3)
Where the sentence dealt with under this section has been passed by a Subordinate Court, the High Court shall not inflict a greater punishment for the offence which in the opinion of the High Court the accused has committed than might have been inflicted by the court which imposed the sentence.
(4)
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
(5)
When an appeal arises from a finding, sentence or order and no appeal is brought, no proceeding by way of revision shall be entertained at the instance of the party who could have appealed.”






5.
It has not been demonstrated that the trial magistrate committed any illegality, impropriety or mistake in convicting and sentencing the applicant. The sentences imposed by the trial court were within the law and by any standard, lenient even considering that the applicant was a first offender.






6.
This court hands are also tied by section 364(5) of the criminal procedure code, cited above which calls on the applicant to file an appeal as against sentence if dissatisfied.






7.
I find that this application is not merited given the serious nature of the offences the applicant was charged with vis-a-vis the sentence imposed.






8.
The application is declined and is dismissed.






9.
It is hereby so ordered.

          (Being an Application seeking extension of time to file  and serve Record of Appeal against the Judgment of the High of Kenya at Nyamira, (Maina, J.) delivered in the  year 2020 in HCCRA No. 616 of 2020)
        
      






Ruling










1.
I have carefully read and considered the application, the supporting affidavit of the applicant as well as the submissions of the respondent. I note that the applicant did not file submissions in support of the application.






2.
However, the respondent supports the application in its submissions. The application seeks extension of time within which to file and serve record of appeal. The reason given by the applicant for not filing the appeal on time was that he was not supplied with the High Court judgment on time. This fact has not been contested by the respondent. If anything and as already stated, the respondent does not oppose the application. I am aware that the power to extend time is discretionary exercisable by court upon satisfactory reason(s) being given for the delay. It is trite that the entire period of delay has to be explained to the satisfaction of the Court.






3.
I am also aware that in considering whether to extend time, the court is obliged to consider whether the intended appeal is arguable and has chances of success, hence not frivolous. In this application, the delay is slightly over 4 years. This period is outrightly outside the 14 days period required by law to file a criminal appeal. It thus requires a plausible explanation to warrant an extension.






4.
Having considered the reason for the delay, being failure to be supplied with the High Court’s judgment in time and the nature of the sentence being served by the applicant and the fact that the respondent is not opposed to the application, I will exercise my unfettered discretion and allow the application.

The Applicant Kevin Otiya Orimbo applies for leave to appeal out of time from conviction and sentence in Kisumu CM Criminal Case No. 3495 of 2014 and that he never appealed in time because he never got proceedings and judgment in time.

It is now over ten years since inception of the case and he does not state when he was sentenced for the offence of defilement to serve 20 years’ imprisonment.

Ruling










1.
Defendant/Applicant filed a Notice of Motion application dated 4
th
 April 2024 under Certificate of Urgency pursuant to Order 10 Rule 11, Order 22 Rule 22, Order 51 Rule 1, 4 and 13 (2) and Order 40 of the Civil Procedure Rules, Section 1A, 1B, 3 and 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Article 50 and 159 of 
the Constitution
, Section 3 and 4 of the 
Fair Administrative Action Act
 and all other enabling provisions of the law.






2.
The Defendant/Applicant seeks that this court sets aside the decree issued on 27
th
 February 2020 and all consequential orders arising therefrom, that this court be pleased to allow the Defendant to defend this suit and costs of this application be provided for.






3.
The application is premised on grounds on its face and the Supporting Affidavit sworn by Priscilla Kamau on 4
th
 April 2024 that the Defendant has since learnt that the Plaintiff obtained an interlocutory judgment herein and a decree was issued on 27
th
 February 2020 for the sum of Kshs. 84,139,264.78 and a further Kshs. 1,117,955.48 taxed as costs. That the Defendant was never notified of the proceedings as there was no service of summons upon it and/or any of its directors. That the Defendant has since obtained the filed pleadings and Affidavit of Service relied upon in endorsing the interlocutory judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. That the Process Server in the said affidavit sworn on 4
th
 February 2020 deponed that when he visited the Defendant’s premises on 24
th
 December 2019, he was informed that the company had closed down. That no effort was made to serve the Defendant save for service via registered post which substituted service was effected without leave of the court.






4.
The Defendant/Applicant further stated that they have not had access to its premises since January 2019 as a result of the legal battles with Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), who with other investigative agencies chased away staff and took up sole control of the Defendant’s premises from January 2019 to December 2022 when they handed back the premises in a ruined state. That the Defendant was never made aware of the instant proceedings until a Statutory Insolvency Notice was issued in HCC COMM NO. E071 of 2024 on 20
th
 March 2024 and the same was served via the Defendant’s Director’s email address. That unless the decree and any execution proceedings are stayed, the Defendant’s application seeking setting aside of the interlocutory judgment and to be allowed to defend the suit in exercising its right to fair hearing shall be rendered nugatory and a mere academic exercise. That the Defendant has a merited defence with triable issues and that it is in the interest of justice that application be allowed as prayed.






5.
The Plaintiff/Respondent in their Replying Affidavit sworn on 6
th
 May 2024 by Mohamed Yusuf Khandwalla, the Financial Controller of the Plaintiff/Respondent, stated that they commenced the suit herein by way of plaint dated 29
th
 November 2019 on account of non-payment of goods supplied to the Defendant despite its knowledge of the same. That despite follow-ups by the Plaintiff, the Defendant never responded to the same nor made any attempts to settle the debt necessitating the filing of the suit herein, almost 5 years ago. That upon filing of the suit and issuance of summons, the same were served on the Defendant as particularized in the Affidavit of Service dated 4
th
 February 2020 by Patrick M. Mutuma. That the mode of service was proper and known in law, and as such the default judgment was regular and could only be set aside if the Defendant has a defence that raises triable issues. That the Plaintiff has partially executed the decree issued pursuant to the default judgment sought to be set aside herein against the Defendant, and as such this application has been overtaken by events and is incapable of being granted.






6.
The Plaintiff/Respondent further avers that partial execution confirms that KRA did not have control of the Defendant’s operations and that is why the Respondent was able to attach funds in the said accounts, more so, the said execution proceedings were undertaken way before the alleged death of the director said to have been in charge of management of the company in 2022, and nothing is placed before this court to prove that the said director was the sole director of the company. That the Applicant’s application is informed by misrepresentation and that the Applicant has approached this court with unclean hands and that the orders sought being equitable reliefs ought to be granted to the most deserving party.






7.
The Plaintiff/Respondent deponed that the defence is a mere denial that does not raise any triable issues to warrant setting aside of the judgment. That the purchase price of the goods supplied was payable in Mombasa where the Plaintiff is resident. This court is therefore ceased of the requisite jurisdiction. That if this court is inclined to allow the application, the same ought to be on condition that the Applicant deposits the entire decretal sum in a joint interest earning account held in the names of advocates for both parties.






8.
The Defendant/Applicant filed a Further Affidavit sworn on 16
th
 May 2024 by Priscilla Kamau that the mode of service adopted by the Plaintiff amounted to substituted service and the Plaintiff has not shown that it followed the laid down procedures of seeking leave to serve by substituted service. That there has never been an admission on the part of the Defendant/Applicant in respect of the alleged amount and the email correspondence was restricted to the fact that they were working on resuming operations. That in light of the fact that the amount therein is disputed, there is need to have the issue proceed for trial and have the issue determined on merit. That the issue of jurisdiction cannot be summarily deliberated upon vide the instant application and will require to hear parties on merit.






9.
The Defendant/Applicant further stated that partial settlement of the decretal amount by way of garnishee proceedings was not voluntary as the Defendant/Applicant were neither notified nor participated in applications leading to execution by way of garnishee proceedings. That partial payment of the decretal amount cannot be said to be an admission of debt when there was no authorization or consent to release of funds held in the accounts and that the said execution was unlawful. That where service of summon was not proper, the setting aside of exparte judgment is a right and not conditional on payment of the decretal amount. That the Plaintiff has admitted that they are already in possession of funds collected from the bank accounts and as such ought not to be heard demanding for further payments until the matter is heard on merit. That payment of the decretal amount is reserved in applications for stay of execution pending determination of an appeal and not in applications designed to set aside exparte judgments on account of irregular service of summons.






10.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. The Defendant/Applicant filed submissions dated 4
th
 June 2024 and argued that there was improper service on the corporation which was contrary to the provisions of Order 5 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The Defendant/Applicant invited the court to be guided by the decision in Agigreen Consulting Corp Limited v National Irrigation Board (2020) eKLR. On whether the Defendant has triable defence, it was argued that the Defendant has pleaded the issue of jurisdiction in its draft defence being that the court lacked jurisdiction as the Defendant is located in Kiambu and the goods were allegedly delivered in Kiambu. That Section 15 (c) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 do not avail an option for litigants to forum shop. The Defendant/Applicant also submitted that it is trite law that where a defence raises triable issues, the court ought to set aside interlocutory judgment as was held in International Air Transport Association & Another v Roskar Travel Limited & 3 Others (Civil Cases E457 of 2020) (2022) KEHC 200 (KLR) (Commercial and Tax) (17 March 2022) (Ruling). The Defendant/Applicant therefore prayed that the instant application be allowed with costs to them.






11.
The Plaintiff/Respondent filed submissions dated 22
nd
 July 2024 and argued on whether there was proper service of summons to enter appearance and whether the default judgment herein was regular judgment, that substituted service is set out under Order 5 Rule 17 and is only applicable where service cannot be effected under Order 5 Rule 3. That service by the Plaintiff was as per Order 5 Rule 3 and reliance was placed on decision in Kibatia & Company Advocates v Kings Group of Schools Limited & Another (Miscellaneous Application 57 of 2020) (2023) KEHC 21590 (KLR) (19 July 2023) (Ruling), B M Mung’ata & Co. Advocates v Mutune David Masai & Another (2020) eKLR to support the position that indeed there was proper service. The Plaintiff/Respondent contended that the court is empowered under Order 10 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules to vary such judgment and any consequential decree or order. That though the power is discretionary, it must be exercised judicially as was the holding in Richard Murigu Wamaiv Attorney General & Another (2018) eKLR. That the rules of setting aside of default judgment has been set out in a litany of cases and the Court of Appeal in James Kanyiita Nderitu & Another v Marios Philotas Lilikas & Another (2016) eKLR differentiated between default judgment obtained regularly and that which has been unregularly obtained.






12.
The Plaintiff/Respondent further submitted on whether there having been partial execution of the decree that the application has been brought late in the day, is overtaken by events and the Applicant is estopped from seeking setting aside of the default judgment. On whether the Applicant has met the threshold for setting aside, the Plaintiff/Respondent argued that the draft defence filed by the Applicant is a sham. That on the issue of territorial jurisdiction, this court is clothed with jurisdiction to hear the matter and as such the same cannot suffice as a triable issue. That in the absence of a reasonable explanation for failure to file defence within the requisite period, the Applicant is undeserving of the orders sought in the application and the same ought to be dismissed with costs. The Plaintiff/Respondent submitted that allowing the application would be tantamount to assisting in obstruction of justice and further delay the matter, but if the court is inclined to grant the orders sought, the same should be conditional on depositing the decretal sum in court or in a joint interest earning account in the names of both advocates. The Plaintiff/Respondent relied on the holding in Manson Oyongo Nyamweya v Kithure Kindiki (2017) eKLR and Henry Orina Okao v Timothy Ogucha Omato (2014) eKLR.






13.
I have considered the Notice of Motion application dated 4th April 2024, the Replying Affidavit sworn on 6th May 2024, Further Affidavit sworn on 16th May 2024, and submissions by the parties. The issues for determination are: -
a.
Whether this court should set aside the decree issued on 27
th
 February 2020 and all consequential orders arising therefrom, and grant the Defendant leave to file their defence.
b.
Who should bear costs of this application.






14.
Courts are empowered under Order 10 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules to enter interlocutory judgment where a plaint has been drawn claiming pecuniary damages as follows: -
1.
Where the plaint makes a liquidated demand only and the defendant fails to appear on or before the day fixed in the summons or all the defendants fail so to appear, the court shall, on request in Form No. 13 of Appendix A, enter judgment against the defendant or defendants for any sum not exceeding the liquidated demand together with interest thereon from the filing of the suit, at such rate as the court thinks reasonable, to the date of the judgment, and costs.
2.
Where the plaint makes a liquidated demand together with some other claim, and the defendant fails, or all the defendants fail, to appear as aforesaid, the Court shall, on request in Form No. 13 of Appendix A, enter judgment for the liquidated demand and interest thereon as provided by sub-rule (1) but the award of costs shall await judgment upon such other claim.






15.
The court may set aside or vary interlocutory judgment entered in default of appearance or defence. Order 10 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides: -
Where judgment has been entered under this Order the court may set aside or vary such judgment and any consequential decree or order upon such terms as are just.






16.
Courts have the discretion of setting aside exparte judgments for the interest of justice to the parties. This court relied on the holding in Philip Kiptoo Chemwolo and Mumias Sugar Company Ltd v Augustine Kubede (1982-1988) KAR to support the position as follows: -
“
The Court has unlimited discretion to set aside or vary a judgment entered in default of appearance upon such terms as are just in the light of all facts and circumstances both prior and subsequent and of the respective merits of the parties”






17.
Inasmuch as the court has the power to set aside the interlocutory judgment and grant the Defendant leave to file a statement of defence, a good explanation ought to be advanced to set aside the judgment. The court in Rayat Trading Co. Limited v Bank of Baroda & Tetezi House Ltd (2018) eKLR held: -
i)
the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim; or
ii)
it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why;
iii)
the judgment should be set aside or varied; or
iv)
the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim






18.
The Defendant/Applicant stated that they were never notified of the proceedings as there was no service of summons upon it and/or any of its directors. That they did not have access to their premises since January 2019 as a result of the legal battles with Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), who with other investigative agencies chased away staff and took up sole control of the Defendant’s premises from January 2019 to December 2022. That no effort was made to serve the Defendant save for service via registered post, which substituted service was effected without leave of the court.






19.
The Plaintiff/Respondent disputed this position and that the mode of service was proper and known in law. That substituted service is set out under Order 5 Rule 17 and is only applicable where service cannot be effected under Order 5 Rule 3. The Plaintiff/Respondent further argued that the default judgment was regular and could only be set aside if the Defendant had a defence that raises triable issues. That the Plaintiff has partially executed the decree issued pursuant to the default judgment sought to be set aside herein against the Defendant, and as such this application has been overtaken by events and is incapable of being granted.






20.
There is no dispute that the Applicants were properly served and by the time the interlocutory judgment was entered, the Defendant/Applicant had neither entered appearance nor filed a statement of defence. Therefore, the interlocutory judgment decree issued on 27
th
 February 2020 was valid and regular. The reason advanced by the Defendant/Applicant that Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), who with other investigative agencies chased away staff and took up sole control of the Defendant’s premises from January 2019 to December 2022, in the considered opinion of this court valid. This court has also had the benefit of perusing the draft defence and established that it raises triable issues.






21.
The upshot is that the Defendant’s Notice of Motion application dated 4
th
 April 2024 is allowed in the following terms: -
a.
The interlocutory judgment and decree issued on 27
th
 February 2020 and all consequential orders arising therefrom be and are hereby set aside.
b.
The Defendant is hereby granted leave to file and serve statement of defence and all requisite documentation within 30 days from the date herein.
c.
The Defendant/Applicant shall pay to the Plaintiff/Respondent thrown away costs of Ksh. 150,000 within 21 days from the date herein.
d.
In default of compliance with order (a), (b) and (c) above, the order vacating the interlocutory judgment shall automatically lapse without further reference to this court.

In the alternative, the applicant was charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11 (1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006. The particulars of this count were that, on diverse dates between 1
st
 May, 2020 to 29
th
 May, 2020 at [Particulars withheld] Refugee Camp in Dadaab Sub-County within Dadaab County, he willfully and intentionally touched the genital organ namely vagina of NMH, a child aged 16 years with his genitals namely penis.






4.
The applicant was convicted on the main charge and sentenced to serve fifteen (15) years imprisonment.






5.
Aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, he moved to this court vide Criminal Appeal No. E053 of 2022 challenging both conviction and sentence.






6.
Through its judgment dated 17
th
 May, 2024, Riechi J, dismissed the appeal in its entirety thus upholding both the conviction and sentence.






7.
Undeterred, he came to this court once again vide what is referred to as the humble mitigation which is undated seeking court’s leniency on grounds that; he is suffering from epilepsy; he is a child to a single parent who is jobless; he has reformed having acquired carpentry skills which he needs to utilize at home and therefore should be set free or be given a non-custodial sentence.






8.
During the hearing, he reiterated the content of his application. In response, prosecution opposed the application calling it an abuse of the court process as the court is functus officio.






9.
I have considered the application herein and the objection thereof. There is no doubt that the applicant was convicted and sentenced to serve 15 years imprisonment. There is no doubt also that he appealed against the said conviction and sentence before this court and the same was dismissed.






10.
According to Riechi J, the sentence imposed was commensurate and appropriate to the offence charged.






11.
For the applicant to seek review of the same sentence it amounts to this court sitting on its own judgement on an appellate capacity. This court is therefore functus officio. Accordingly, I have no jurisdiction to hear this application. To that extent, the application is dismissed.

          September 30, 2024
        






Between




Joseph Ochieng


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent










Ruling










1.
Joseph Ochieng, the Applicant, has approached this court seeking bail pending appeal. He was charged in Makadara Chief Magistrate’s court with three (3) counts of committing indecent acts with three (3) minors aged between 13 and 11 years, respectively. Having been taken through full trial he was found guilty on all the three (3) counts, convicted and sentenced to serve five (5) years imprisonment on each count.






2.
The application is premised on grounds that the applicant is of ill health and his continued stay in prison jeopardizes his frail health; he is not flight risk; he has a young family of six (6) children who solely depend on him; the burden of proof was not discharged by the prosecution; and, that it is in the interest of justice for the application to be allowed.






3.
The State/Respondent filed grounds of opposition urging that; the application lacks merit, is misconceived and unsubstantiated; is incompetent and does not meet the threshold of granting bail pending appeal. That the application is an abuse of the court process as the prosecution discharged its burden beyond reasonable doubt; and, the applicant has not demonstrated any special exceptional or unusual circumstances to warrant the grant of bail pending appeal.






4.
I have considered the rival arguments. Section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Code relied on by the applicant provides thus:
(1)
After the entering of an appeal by a person entitled to appeal, the High Court, or the subordinate court which convicted or sentenced that person, may order that he be released on bail with or without sureties, or, if that person is not released on bail, shall at his request order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against shall be suspended pending the hearing of his appeal: Provided that, where an application for bail is made to the subordinate court and is refused by that court, no further application for bail shall lie to the High Court, but a person so refused bail by a subordinate court may appeal against refusal to the High Court and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections 352 and 359, the appeal shall not be summarily rejected and shall be heard, in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, before one judge of the High Court sitting in chambers.
(2)
If the appeal is ultimately dismissed and the original sentence confirmed, or some other sentence of imprisonment substituted therefor, the time during which the appellant has been released on bail or during which the sentence has been suspended shall be excluded in computing the term of imprisonment to which he is finally sentenced.
(3)
The Chief Justice may make rules of court to regulate the procedure in cases under this section.






5.
Principles for granting bail pending appeal were stated in Jivraj Shah Vs. Republic (1986) KLR 606 as follows:
“
(1)
The principal consideration in an application for bond pending appeal is the existence of exceptional or unusual circumstances upon which the Court of Appeal can fairly conclude that it is in the interest of justice to grant bail.
(2)
If it appears prima face from the totality of the circumstances that the appeal is likely to be successful on account of some substantial point of law to be argued and that the sentence or substantial part of it will have been served by the time the appeal is heard, conditions for granting bail exists.
(3)
The main criteria is that there is no difference between overwhelming chances of success and a set of circumstances which disclose substantial merit in the appeal which could result in the appeal being allowed and the proper approach is the consideration of the particular circumstances and weight and relevance of the points to be argued.”






6.
In Dominic Karanja Vs. Republic (1986) KLR 612, the court stated thus:
“
(a)
The most important issue was that if the appeal had such overwhelming chances of success, there is no justification for depriving the applicant of his liberty and the minor relevant considerations would be whether there were exceptional or unusual circumstances;
(b)
The previous good character of the applicant and the hardships if any facing his family were not exceptional or unusual factors. Ill health per se would also not constitute an exceptional circumstance where there existed medical facilities for prisoners;
(c)
A solemn assertion by an applicant that he will not abscond if released, even if it is supported by sureties, is not sufficient ground for releasing a convicted person on bail pending appeal;
(d)
…………..”






6.
The right to bail pending appeal is not automatic and not subject to the right to be presumed innocent as provided by Article 49(1)(h) of 
the Constitution
; therefore; the question whether the person is a flight risk or not does not arise. In Mutua Vs. R (1988) the court of appeal stated that
“
It must be remembered that an applicant for bail has been convicted by a properly constituted court and is undergoing punishment because of that conviction which stands until it is set aside on appeal. It is not wise or to set the applicant at liberty either from the point of view of his welfare or of the state unless there is a real reason why the court should do so.”






6.
The applicant herein was convicted and is serving a lawful sentence. His appeal will be considered as a balance of rights between the convict whose appeal should not be rendered nugatory and the public interest to punish him as the offender that he is. This means that the burden of proof lies on the applicant to establish the factors that may be favourable to him calling for his release on bail at this stage.






7.
In Mutua Vs. R. (Supra) the court held that:
“
It is not wise to set the applicant at liberty either from the point of view of his welfare or of the state unless there is a real reason why the court should do so. It is my opinion that the applicant has not established existence of any exceptional circumstances to warrant grant of bail pending appeal..”






6.
It is argued by the applicant that there were contradictions in the matter, the evidence of the minors was uncorroborated; ingredients of the offence were not proved; and, the magistrate approached the case with a predetermined mindset hence proceeding on the wrong basis of the law.






6.
The argument put forth suggests that the appeal has high chances of succeeding. Where there is a likelihood of an appeal succeeding the appellate court would have no reason of denying the applicant orders sought. The instant matter concerns three minors of tender age where evidence adduced can be relied on to return a verdict of guilty as long as the trial court believes the child(ren) and records reasons for the belief. The applicant has delved into merits of the appeal which this court must restrain itself from determining at this stage lest it is deemed to conclusively determine the appeal.






7.
On the question of existence of exceptional circumstances; it is submitted that the applicant is innocent, he is a bread winner of children, he is of ill health and requires specialized treatment.






8.
As clearly stated in the Dominic Karanja case (Supra) hardship facing a family, if any, exists, as it was not demonstrated in the instant case; and, even ill health, as medical facilities that are equipped exist in prisons, do not amount to exceptional circumstances.






6.
The upshot of the above is that, the applicant has failed to discharge the duty of demonstrating existence of reasons requiring him to be released on bail pending appeal. Accordingly, the appeal which is unmeritorious fails and is dismissed.






7.
It is so ordered.

(DECEASED)

Yukie Saito Rombo


 


Petitioner




and




Kenneth Omondi Okello


 


Applicant










Ruling










1.
The application for determination is dated 11
th
 March 2024 filed by the applicant seeking for orders that;
1.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to stay the execution of the judgment delivered on 17
TH
 November 2023 pending the hearing and determination of this application and the intended appeal.
2.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to grant leave to file an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the entire judgment delivered on 17
TH
 November 2023 and the order issued on 8
th
 December 2023.
3.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to enlarge the time limited for filing an Appeal against the entire judgment delivered on 17
th
 November 2023 and the order issued on 8
th
 December 2023.
4.
That costs to be in the cause.






2.
The application is premised on the grounds on face of it and the supporting affidavit of Kenneth Omolo Omondi sworn on even date.






3.
The applicant briefly deponed that at the time of delivery of the said judgment, the Applicant was not present since he was not aware of the judgment date, and he was sick.






4.
The applicant deposed that on 23
rd
 June 2023 when the matter was in court in the presence of the petitioner's advocate and the Applicant, the court indicated that judgment was to be delivered on notice. However, the Applicant was not informed of the date of judgment.






5.
The applicant stated that on 26
th
 February 2024 the Applicant came to know that judgment had been delivered by this court when he was called by the Manager of Kenyatta University Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme, a Scheme where the deceased had pension benefits which are subject of this cause. The said manager informed him that the Petitioner had requested for the funds that had been apportioned / set -aside for the minors.






6.
The applicant stated that the delay in filing this application was occasioned by sickness of the Applicant and the Applicant being unaware that the judgment had been delivered as he was not served with the judgment notice. The applicant stated that If stay of execution is not granted, the Applicant and the minors intend to suffer since the deceased's pension scheme benefits' that had been set —aside for the use by the minors for payments of school fees and their maintenance is likely to be released to the Petitioner, as a result the best interests of the children would be at stake. The applicant stated that there are no orders of stay in force and the applicant stand a risk of the deceased's pension benefits set-aside for the minors to be released to the Petitioner






7.
The respondent opposed the application and filed a Replying Affidavit dated 114
th
 April 2024 in opposition to the application. The respondent briefly deposed that the court upon observance of the character of the applicant herein at paragraph 63 of the judgment concluded that; ""clearly the objector is not an honest witness"". The respondent stated that the delay in filing the application for leave to appeal is therefore inexcusable.






8.
The respondent deponed that the impugned judgment was made after the parties had been granted fair opportunity to prosecute and close their respective cases. For his part, the applicant gave evidence and was able to call all his witnesses to wit Joseph Rombo (the biological brother of the late George Omolo), Gordon the respondent stated that the Judgment was made with the benefit of court hearing, assessing and evaluating the evidence of all the parties and is therefore solid on facts and the law.






9.
By consent of parties the application was canvassed by way of written submissions. The applicant filed written submissions dated 26
th
 April 2024 and the respondent filed written submissions dated 14
TH
 may 2024 I have carefully analyzed and considered the submissions and case law relied on by the parties.






10.
The main issues arising for dtermination are:
i.
Whether this court should grant stay of execution of judgement delivered on 17
th
 November 2023.
ii.
Whether this court should grant the appellant leave to file appeal out of time.






11.
On the 1
st
 issue It is trite law that for application seeking stay pending appeal the Applicant must meet the statutory requirements set out in Order 42 Rule 6 which states: -
(2)
No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub rule (1) unless-
(a)
The court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the Applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
Such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the Applicant.






12.
With regard to substantial loss, the applicant has submitted that there are no orders of stay in force and the applicant stand a risk of the deceased’s pension benefits set-aside for the minors if the same are released to the Petitioner and / or if the petitioner commences execution. He submitted that the minors, John Yona and Fenny Adhiambo intend to suffer since 40% of the deceased’s pension scheme benefits had been set –aside for them i.e. payment of school fees and their maintenance contrary to the best interests of the children order.






13.
The respondent on his part submitted that the order as framed is incapable of stay for reason that it is a negative.






14.
I have analyzed the judgment delivered on 17
th
 November 2023 and I note that there is nothing to be stayed. I therefore disallow the same.






15.
On the 2
nd
 issue the applicant is seeking order to file appeal out of time. Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 provides that. ""every person has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of the law decided in a fair and public hearing before a court, or if appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or body.""






16.
The administration of justice should normally require that the substance of all disputes should be investigated and decided on their merit, and that errors, lapses should not necessarily debar a litigant from the pursuit of his rights… it would seem that the main purpose of litigation namely the hearing and determination of disputes, should be fostered rather than hindered. See the case of Branco Arabe Espanol Vs Bank of Uganda (1999) 2 EA 22 (SCU). The same sentiments were echoed in the case of Bamanya Vs Zaver (2002) 2EA 329 (CAU) where the Judge observed: -
“
The other principle governing the application …. is that administration of justice requires that all substances of disputes should be heard and decided on merits and for the aforesaid reasons, errors or faults of the counsel should not necessary debar a litigant from enforcing his rights.”






17.
The court went on to say, the right to a hearing has always been a well-protected right in our constitution and is also the cornerstone of the rule of law. The Appellants in this case contend he has an arguable appeal and he has also explained why he was not able to file the appeal on time. I allow him to file the appeal out of time as disallowing the same would go against the spirit of the overriding objectives and also the provisions of Article 159 of 
the Constitution
. I also note that the respondent herein will not suffer prejudice if the appeal is admitted.






18.
In the upshot, I make the following orders: -
1.
I hereby decline to issue order of stay of execution of judgment delivered on 17
th
 November 2023.
2.
The Applicant is hereby granted leave to file appeal out of time.

Ruling










1.
I have perused the notice of motion dated 21.6.2024 and the supporting affidavit of Samuel Onyango Otieno and I do note that whereas he states that he had failed to lodge an appeal within 14 days from 26.4.2023 due to false promises by his relatives who had allegedly undertaken to retain an advocate for him, he has not made disclosure of the identity of the relatives that misled him nor the advocate that the undisclosed relatives had approached. Nor has he annexed the fee note of the advocate, whose fees his relatives failed to pay.






2.
I do note that the reason advanced has therefore not been substantiated to the satisfaction of this court wherefore I decline to extend time.

Upon perusal of the notice of motion dated 19.8.2024 and the supporting affidavit sworn by Joseph Okoth Otieno on even date, I do note that the Applicant has not demonstrated that he had indeed attempted to lodge an appeal within time.

Ruling










1.
For determination is the application dated 21
st
 November, 2023 brought under Order 17 Rule 2 (6) of the Civil Procedure Rules and Sections 1A, 1B and 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 seeking the following orders;
1.
…………………………..Spent;
2.
This Honourable Court be pleased to order reinstatement of the suit herein;
3.
That costs be in the cause.






2.
The application is supported by the grounds on the face of the application and the supporting affidavit sworn by Alfelt Mumbo Abio on even date. He deponed that sometime in January 2021, they instructed the firm of E.M Washe & Associates to file a suit against the Defendants and they were later on informed that the partner of the law firm had been appointed as a judge in the Environment and Land Court. He also deponed that the file was handed over to another advocate to take up the matter; that upon inquiry as to the update on the matter he was informed that the advocate was sickly and admitted in hospital; that due to lack of communication from the instructed advocates, he sought legal advice from another firm of advocates who perused the file and realized that the suit herein had been dismissed for want of prosecution on 8
th
 May, 2023. He further deponed that upon perusal of the affidavit of service they noticed that the application to dismiss the suit was served via an email address which belonged to the former law firm of the Honourable Judge which firm was not operational at the time. According to him, they are willing to prosecute the matter to its logical conclusion.






3.
In response to the application, the 1
st
 Defendant/ Respondent filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by ALFRED WANGA on the 15
th
 January, 2024. In that affidavit the deponent stated that upon realizing that the suit had been in court for more than one year, he filed the instant application dated 25
th
 November, 2022 seeking to have the suit dismissed for want of prosecution which they served upon the applicants’ advocate together with the hearing date.






4.
According to him, when the matter came up on the 24
th
 January, 2023, there was no appearance by the Plaintiffs and as such, they sought to have the application allowed however, the court directed that the matter be mentioned on a further date to give the Plaintiffs an opportunity to respond; that on the 28
th
 February, 2023 when the matter came up to confirm compliance by the parties, Mr. Ngoya was present for the Plaintiffs informed the court that he was seeking time to get instructions from the client on how to proceed with the matter; that further, when the matter came up on the 8
th
 May, 2023, there was no representation from the plaintiffs/applicants; that on the 11
th
 May, 2023 the court delivered its ruling on the matter and allowed the application. According to him, as a result of this disinterest, the Defendants moved to court seeking to have the matter dismissed for want of prosecution.






5.
The 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Defendants in opposition filed Grounds of Opposition dated 24
th
 January, 2024 stating that the application was devoid of merit since the suit being sought to be reinstated was dismissed pursuant to the provisions of Order 17 Rule 2 (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules; that the applicants had failed to furnish any proof of any application made or any steps taken during the intervening one-year period prior to the dismissal of the suit.






Submissions


6.
The Plaintiffs/Applicants through the firm of Muthike & Makworo Advocates filed submissions on the 5
th
 December, 2023. In his submissions Counsel identified one issue for determination: whether the Plaintiffs/Applicants have met the threshold for grant of the orders being sought. He submitted that on 17
th
 April, 2023 a Hearing notice was served upon the email address of washemutwana@gmail.com and there being no response the court dismissed the matter for want of prosecution on 8
th
 May, 2023.






7.
It was his submission that the firm of E.M Washe & Associates Advocates was no longer in operation on grounds that the founding partner was appointed a Judge in the Environment and Land Court and this explained why the emails were not responded to. He also submitted that the applicants have moved the court within a reasonable period of time expressing their willingness to prosecute the matter. According to him, the delay was not intentional as there was a mistaken believe that the advocate who took up the matter could update them on the progress. Counsel relied on the case of Catherine Kigasia Kivai vs Ernest Ogesi Kivai & 4 others (2021) eKLR.






8.
The 1
st
 Defendant/1
st
 Respondent on the other hand filed their submissions on the 17
th
 January, 2024 through the firm of Alfred Wanga & Co. Advocates. Counsel submitted that Order 5 Rule 22B of the Civil Procedure Rules allows service by email to the parties last confirmed and used email address; that an officer of the court who is duly authorized to effect service shall file an Affidavit of service attaching the electronic mail service delivery receipt confirming service. According to counsel, they have since filed an appeal and a Bill of Costs whose Ruling was delivered on 27
th
 January, 2024 and as such the 1
st
 defendant will be greatly prejudiced in the event the suit is reinstated. He relied on the cases of Josphat Mabiala Akoyo v George Mabele Sifuna & John Odhiambo (2022) eKLR referred to the case of Omwoyo vs African Highlands & Produce Co. Ltd (2002) 1 KLR. He also relied on the case of Ivita vs Kyumbu (1984) KLR 441 where the court laid down principles for issuance of an order of dismissal of suit for want of prosecution.








Analysis And Determination.


9.
I have considered the application dated 21
st
 November, 2023, the responses thereto and the submissions by counsels. In my opinion, the only issue for determination is whether the plaintiffs/applicants have satisfied this court to move it to reinstate the suit. The dismissal was made pursuant to the provisions of Order 17 Rule 2 CPR, which provides that:
“
2.
In any suit in which no application has been made or step taken by either party for one year, the court may give notice in writing to the parties to show cause why the suit should not be dismissed, and if cause is not shown to its satisfaction, may dismiss the suit;
2.
If cause is shown to the satisfaction of the court it may make such orders as it thinks fit to obtain expeditious hearing of the suit.
3.
Any party to the suit may apply for its dismissal as provided in sub-rule 1;
4.
The court may dismiss the suit for non-compliance with any direction given under this Order.”






10.
The power to dismiss a suit for want of prosecution is at the discretion of the court. In Nilesh Premchand Mulji Shah & Another t/a Ketan Emporium v M.D. Popat & others & another [2016] eKLR, the court stated as follows:
“
11.
Nonetheless, Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 and Order 17 Rule 2(3) gives the court the discretion to dismiss the suit where no action has been taken for one year and on application by a party as justice delayed without explanation is justice denied and delay defeats equity. That discretion must be exercised on the basis that it is in the interest of justice regard being had to whether the party instituting the suit has lost interest in it, or whether the delay in prosecuting the suit is inordinate, unreasonable, inexcusable, and is likely to cause serious prejudice to the defendant on account of that delay. This is what the case of Ivita v Kyumba [1984] KLR 441 espoused that: “The test applied by the courts in the application for dismissal of a suit for want of prosecution is whether the delay is prolonged and inexcusable, and if it is, whether justice can be done despite the delay. Thus, even if the delay is prolonged, if the court is satisfied with the plaintiff’s excuse for the delay, and that justice can still be done to the parties, the action will not be dismissed but it will be ordered that it be set down for hearing at the earliest time. It is a matter of and in the discretion of the court.”






11.
I have also considered the history of this suit noting that the suit was filed on the 29
th
 January, 2021. The record is however silent on what transpired up until the application 28
th
 November, 2022 when the application to dismiss for want of prosecution was filed. It is evident that the matter came up several times; on 24
th
 January, 2023 when the matter came up for hearing of that application, there was no appearance by the Plaintiffs and as such, the Defendant/Respondent sought to have the application allowed however, the court directed that the matter be mentioned on a further date to give the Plaintiffs an opportunity to respond. On the 28
th
 February, 2023 when the matter came up to confirm compliance by the parties, Mr. Ngoya was present for the Plaintiffs informed the court that he was seeking time to get instructions from the clients on how to proceed with the matter.






12.
When the matter came up on 8
th
 May, 2023, there was no representation from the Plaintiffs/applicants and on the 11
th
 May, 2023 the court delivered its ruling on the matter and allowed the application to dismiss the suit for want of prosecution.






13.
I have also considered the reasons advanced by the Plaintiff/ applicant seeking to have the suit reinstated. The same resolves around the issue of representation by counsel and it is my opinion that upon an assessment of the circumstances of this case a reasonable justification has been given for the proposed reinstatement. Mishaps do happen as has been described in the present case. Besides, I have also wholistically considered the facts of the case and in view of the provisions of Article 159(2) (d) and for the sake a view of rendering substantive justice in this dispute, it is this court’s view that it is only just and expedient for the Plaintiff’s suit to be reinstated for it to be heard on merit.






14.
In the light of the foregoing I allow the application dated 21
st
 November, 2023 as prayed in prayer no 2 and 3 thereof. This suit shall be mentioned on 31/10/2024 for issuance of further directions.

Judgment










1.
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Plaintiffs through the plaint dated 3
rd
 November 2022 prayed for judgment against the Defendants jointly and severally for a declaration that the usurious and exorbitant interest and penalties being charged by the 1
st
 Defendant on the Plaintiffs’ loan account is unlawful and unconscionable and as a result should be set aside. That in the first instance a temporary injunction and thereafter a permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their agents, servants, or whomsoever acting under their directions from advertising, interfering, transferring, selling by public auction or dealing, in any way with the Plaintiffs’ portion of land known as L.R. No. MN/II/4561. That an order directing the 1
st
 Defendant to render true and full accounts to the Plaintiffs. That costs of the suit together with interest thereon at such rate and for such period of time as this court may deem fit to grant.






2.
The Plaintiff averred that at all material times to the suit, the 2
nd
 Plaintiff was the registered owner of the parcel of land known as L.R. No. MN/11/4561. The 1
st
 Plaintiff avers that it took a loan guaranteed by the 2
nd
 Plaintiff sometimes in November 2012 for a sum of Kshs. 32,000,000 for completion of construction of the church and a further Kshs. 5,000,000 for the purchase of an adjacent parcel of land making a total of Kshs. 37,000,000. That the Plaintiff has been making monthly repayments towards repayment of the loan and at the time of filing the suit, they had paid approximately Kshs. 60,000,000. That in terms of interest, they had paid a total of Kshs. 39,000,000 which exceeds the principal sum lent to the Plaintiff.






3.
The Plaintiff stated that they had the loan restructured during the COVID period and averred that they continued making the monthly instalments. That the 1
st
 Defendant issued instructions to the 2
nd
 Defendant who issued a 45 days’ statutory notice which threatened the suit property with public auction. That the said notice is claiming a sum of Kshs. 26,265,700 which the Plaintiffs dispute as punitive interest and penalties having been levied, making it almost impossible for the Plaintiff to redeem its property. That the 1
st
 Defendant’s statutory power of sale has not arisen and the purported threat of public auction is therefore illegal, null and void.






4.
The Defendants entered appearance and filed a statement of defence dated 24
th
 March 2023 that by way of an offer letter dated 28
th
 August 2012, the 1
st
 Defendant advance the 1
st
 Plaintiff a loan facility of Kshs. 32,000,000 to finance construction of a church, which facility was payable by way of 60 equal monthly instalments of Kshs. 986,916 until payment in full. That by way of a facility dated 20
th
 November 2015, the 1
st
 Defendant advanced the 1
st
 Plaintiff a further loan of Kshs. 5,000,000 repayable by way of 84 equal monthly instalments of Kshs. 120,236.






5.
The Defendants stated that by the letter dated 25
th
 May 2017, the 1
st
 Plaintiff requested the bank to restructure the existing loan which was accepted and the bank advanced a sum of Kshs. 27,868,000 repayable by way of 120 equal monthly instalments of Kshs. 432,917, and that the purpose of this facility was to restructure the existing loans. That by way of a letter dated 30
th
 November 2020, the Plaintiffs requested for restructuring of the loan which led to a 60 days’ moratorium on the principal only when the outstanding loan facility was Kshs. 26,522,207.74. When the loan was restructured as requested, the borrower executed an addendum to the offer letter which showed an acceptance of Kshs. 26,522,207.74 as the loan outstanding as at 24
th
 December 2020.






6.
The Defendants averred that the 1
st
 Plaintiff defaulted in repaying the loan facility as a result of which the available remedies invoked by the 1
st
 Defendant included issuing the Plaintiffs with a 90 days’ statutory notice of sale dated 2
nd
 March 2022 in light of the loan arrears then being Kshs. 26,205,238.39 and that the same was sent by registered post to the 1
st
 Plaintiff’s address. That the Plaintiffs did not regularize the loan account by clearing the arrears or making any reasonable repayment and the 1
st
 Defendant proceeded to issue them with a 40 days’ notice of intention to sell the suit property dated 14
th
 June 2022.






7.
That on 16
th
 September 2022, the bank instructed its auctioneers, the 2
nd
 Defendant herein to dispose the charged property by way of public auction so as to recover the outstanding loan balance then being Kshs. 26,625,558.65. That the amount included the additional interest accrued on the outstanding loan amount as per terms of the facility. That it is therefore improper for the Plaintiffs to allege that the interests were exorbitant/punitive, yet they were aware of the bank’s interest rates and charges when the 2
nd
 Plaintiff agreed to charge the property. The 2
nd
 Defendant proceeded to serve the Plaintiffs with the requisite 45 days’ redemption notice and the notification of sale dated 19
th
 September 2022 whereby the 2
nd
 Plaintiff acknowledged receipt by affixing her signature. That the notification of sale informed her of the scheduled public auction which the auctioneers intended to conduct on 1
st
 December 2022. That the Plaintiffs have no reasonable cause of action against the Defendants and are not entitled to the prayers sought. The Defendants therefore prayed that the Plaintiff’s suit against them be dismissed with costs.






8.
The matter was set down for hearing of the Plaintiffs’ case. The Plaintiffs called on witness, Nancy Wangeci, who reiterated the statement dated 3
rd
 November 2022 of Jane Wanjiku Kiratu (Deceased), who was the founder and senior pastor of Siloam Ministries. The witness also relied on her statement dated 12
th
 October 2023 which was adopted as evidence in chief and was cross examined on the same.






9.
On 17
th
 October 2023, the court herein referred the matter to court annexed mediation. However, as per the Mediator’s Report signed by the Mediation Deputy Registrar, Catherine Jackline Amugohe, on 26
th
 January 2024, the parties could not reach a mediation settlement. The matter therefore went back to court for directions and was set down for defence hearing on 8
th
 May 2024.






10.
The Defendants also called one witness, Alex Lewis Osoro, the Branch Relationships Manager, who adopted his statement dated 24
th
 March 2023 as examination in chief and was cross examined on it.






11.
This court gave directions for parties to file and serve written submissions. The Plaintiff filed their submissions dated 19
th
 July 2024 while the Defendants filed their submissions dated 24
th
 July 2024.






12.
I have considered the Plaint dated 3
rd
 November 2022, the statement of defence dated 24
th
 March 2023, evidence, and submissions of the parties. The issues for determination are: -
a.
Whether there was a legal basis for the interest and penalties charged by the 1
st
 Defendant.
b.
Whether the Plaintiffs have met the threshold for grant of an injunction.
c.
Who should bear costs.






13.
On the first issue, it is not in dispute that by way of an offer letter dated 28
th
 August 2012 the 1
st
 Defendant advanced the Plaintiff a loan facility of Kshs. 32,000,000.00 payable by way of 60 equal monthly instalments of Kshs. 98,916 until payment in full. By way of a facility letter dated 10
th
 November 2015, the 1
st
 Defendant advanced the 1
st
 Plaintiff a further loan of Kshs. 5,000,000 payable by way of 84 equal monthly instalments. It is also not in dispute that the 2
nd
 Plaintiff guaranteed the facility by L.R. No. MN/11//4561 as security and legal instruments prepared and registered.






14.
The loans advanced to the 1
st
 Plaintiff are governed by written contracts whose terms, conditions and consequences of non-performance are clearly set out, agreed upon and signed by the parties. Charges were registered by the Defendant to secure their interest over the suit property. The charges contain lending terms and conditions, chargeable interest and penalties among other charges.






15.
According to the records, pleadings and evidence, and which the Plaintiffs so admit, the loan was restructured during the COVID period. The addendum letter dated 24
th
 December 2020 indicates that the Plaintiffs made a request dated 30
th
 November 2020 for restructure of the loan. The 1
st
 Defendant indicated that the request would lead to a 60 days’ moratorium on the principal only, the interest was to continue being serviced on a monthly basis for the loan facility totaling to Kshs. 26,522,207.74, repayment date was to be as from 24
th
 January 2021, and that the terms and conditions were to remain as per the offer letter dated 8
th
 November 2019.






16.
The Plaintiffs now claim that the 1
st
 Defendant has been applying rates that were out of the ambit of the offer letter. That the amount indicated as interest charged is way above normal and that the contractually agreed rate of interest was 13.3% but the same was increased to 24.5% by the 1
st
 Defendant without prior notice to them. That in line with the current authorities, it offends Section 44 of the 
Banking Act
.






17.
Upon perusal of copies of offer letters on record, the indicated interest rates are indeed 24.5%. They also indicate additional interest to be levied where the borrower fails to pay any sums payable on its due date. This court also notes that the amounts indicated in the loan repayment statements were well below the amounts required to be paid as monthly instalments. The 1
st
 Plaintiff therefore fell in arrears and contacted the bank on a few occasions seeking their indulgence.






18.
This court is therefore of the view that the Plaintiffs willingly signed the letters of offer as well as charge documents. They are now bound by the contracts that they are referring to as unlawful and unconscionable, which the court has no jurisdiction to vary. In National Bank of Kenya v Pipeplastic Samkolit (K) Ltd and Another, NRB CA Civil Appeal No. 95 of 1995 (2001) eKLR the Court of Appeal observed: -
A Court of law cannot re-write a contract between the parties. The parties are bound by the terms of their contract, unless coercion, fraud or undue influence are pleaded and proved. There was not the remotest suggestion of coercion, fraud or undue influence in regard to the terms of the charge. As was stated by Shah JA in the case of Fina Bank Limited vs Spares & Industries Limited (Civil Appeal No 51 of 2000) (unreported): “It is clear beyond peradventure that save for those special cases where equity might be prepared to relieve a party from a bad bargain, it is ordinarily no part of equity’s function to allow a party to escape from a bad bargain.






19.
On the next issue of whether the Plaintiffs have met the threshold for grant of an injunction, it has been established that an injunction is an equitable remedy. The party seeking the remedy is therefore required to approach the court with clean hands to benefit from discretionary powers of the court. From the foregoing and pursuant to the principles set out in the case of Giella v Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd (1973) EA 358, the Plaintiffs secured loan facilities from the 1
st
 Defendant and fell in arrears. The Plaintiffs have therefore not satisfied the conditions for grant of the orders of injunction.






20.
The suit is dismissed with costs to the Defendants.

Ruling










1.
The motion before court is dated 14 February 2022 and is expressed to be brought under section 8 (2) of the 
Law Reform Act
, cap. 26 and Order 53 rules 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The applicant seeks the following orders:
“


1.
That this Honorable court be pleased to issue orders of certiorari directed to the 1
st
, 2nd and 3rd respondents, by themselves their servants and/or agents or any other officer acting under their authority to bring before this court for the purpose of being quashed the inquiry order dated 20th April 2022, for the dissolution of the management and supervisory boards of Metropolitan National Sacco, all administrative actions, decisions or measures initiated or put in process/motion by the Respondents or their agents and hinged or founded on the impugned inquiry report of the servants and/or the1st Respondent.






2.
That this Honorable court be pleased to issue orders of prohibition directed to the 1st , 2nd and 3
rd
 (sic) respondents , by themselves their servants and/or agents or any other officer acting under their authority from dealing in any way with the impugned inquiry report, decision, finding/recommendations in whatsoever manner detrimental to the applicants.”


The applicant has also sought for an order on costs.
The application is based on a statutory statement dated 2 February 2023 and an affidavit verifying the facts relied on sworn on even date by Mr. Duncan Chege Njau.






2.
According to these documents, vide Kenya Gazette No. 4558 Vol. CXXIV-No. 71 dated 22 April, 2022, the Respondents commenced an inquiry into the affairs of a cooperative society called Metropolitan National Sacco. The inquiry order made specific reference to the co-operative Society's by-laws, working and financial conditions and the conduct of the society’s present and past directors in the management of the cooperative society.  The team conducting the inquiry was  drawn from the office of the 1
st
 Respondent and from the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority.






3.
The inquiry commenced on 26 April 2022 and continued past September 2022 which, according to the applicants, was beyond the period of fifteen days prescribed by the Gazette Notice No. 4558 and also beyond the sixty days' maximum period expressly provided for by Rule 46(1) of the Co­ operative Society Rules of 2004. A summary of the inquiry report was presented to the Metropolitan National Sacco's General Meeting held on the 29 October 2022.






4.
According to the applicants, the scope of the inquiry was to cover a period of ten years but what was presented to the meeting covered the period between the year 1997 – 2022; a period of twenty-five years, yet there were no records which were provided in the meeting covering this period. The aspect of the report covering the period commencing 1997 is said to be illegal since it is alleged to have been an abuse of the terms provided by the 
Co-operative Societies Act
, cap 490. A summary of the inquiry report implied that the financial statements of the co-operative Society were fictitious.






5.
The applicants are aggrieved by the report because, although members of the management committee who apparently, included the applicants, were adversely mentioned in the report, they were not given an opportunity to defend themselves and were, therefore, condemned unheard. Further, no deliberations by the general meeting were conducted on the summary of the report. According to the applicants, the County Director of Co-operatives had already indicated the 1
st
 Respondent's intention to implement the inquiry report even before its presentation to members. This, the applicants argue, demonstrates that a predetermined decision had been made and, therefore, the applicants were not given a fair hearing. In the circumstances, it is the applicants’ case that the management committee together with the supervisory board were dismissed unfairly.






6.
In response to the motion, the respondents filed a preliminary objection on the ground:
“


1.
That the proceeding of Certiorari fatally violates the mandatory provisions of Section 9(3) of the 
Law Reform Act
 (Cap 26) and Order 53 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, being the six-month limitation period imposed by above Laws.”








7.
Besides the preliminary objection, the 1
st
 respondents also filed a replying affidavit sworn by Mr. David K. Obonyo. Paragraphs 2 to 6 of the affidavit appear to be missing from the affidavit uploaded on the portal but from what I gather in what is left of that affidavit is the contention that the impugned inquiry was conducted lawfully and procedurally and, at any rate, in accordance with the law. Contrary to the applicant’s allegations, the applicants were given opportunity to be heard.






8.
According to Mr. Obonyo, the 
Co-operative Societies Act
, provides that all officers and members of the Society shall produce such cash, accounts, books, documents and securities of the Society and furnish such information in regard to the affairs of the Society, as the person conducting the inquiry may require. In this regard, summons were duly issued to the requisite persons to furnish such information in respect to the affairs of the Society to aid in the inquiry.






9.
Section 58(3) of the Act provides that the Commissioner shall report the findings of the inquiry at the general meeting of the Society and shall give directions for the implementation of the recommendations of the Inquiry Report.Accordingly, upon conclusion of the inquiry, the findings of the inquiry were reported to the members of the Society in a General Meeting held 29 October 2022. The inquiry determined, among other things, that the Board members and Senior Management of the cooperative society, both current and past had and still conducted the business of the Society in a manner that is contrary to the provisions of Cooperative 
Societies Act
, cap. 490, 
Sacco Societies Act
, 2008 and the Regulations made thereunder.






10.
The report also determined that the society was being run in a manner that is detrimental to, and not being in the best interests of Society members and members of the public at large within the meaning of Section 51 of the 
Sacco Societies Act
 as read with Reg. 67 of the Regulations 2010 made thereunder which put to risk the continued sustainability and financial stability of the Sacco.






11.
The Applicants, it is alleged, were always aware of the inquiry and, as matter of fact, they attended the meetings including the General Meeting convened for the purpose of presentation of the Inquiry Report to the members of the cooperative Society. Upon presentation of the Inquiry Report to the members of the Society and pursuant to Section 58 (3) of the Act, the report became a public document, accessible to all persons including the Applicants.






12.
Further, the respondents have been advised by their counsel, which advice they believe to be true, that Section 58(4) of the Act provides that where the Commissioner is satisfied, after due inquiry, that the Committee of the Society is not performing its duties properly, he may dissolve the committee and cause to be appointed an interim committee consisting of not more than five members from among the members of the Society for a period not exceeding ninety days. It is for this reason that the Board or Management and the Supervisory Board of the Society were dissolved. According to Section 28(4) (k) of the Act, no person shall be a member of a Committee if he has been adversely mentioned by the Commissioner in an Inquiry Report adopted by a general meeting.






13.
The respondents’ case is that the inquiry was conducted lawfully and procedurally and in particular, the rules of natural justice were adhered to. Thus, the report findings were legally and rationally arrived at.






14.
The respondents also contend that they have been advised by their counsel, which advice they verily believe to be true that the applicants’ application offends the mandatory provision of section 9(3) of the 
Law Reform Act
 according to which leave to file proceedings for an order of certiorari can only be granted if the application for such leave is made within three months of the date the cause of action arose. In the instant application, the order which the applicants seek to impeach was contained in a gazette notice published on 22 April 2022 yet the application was filed in February 2023.






15.
It is clear from the prayer 1 in the applicant’s application and, indeed there should not be any doubt that the impugned order, central to the applicant’s application is the “inquiry order” published in gazette notice no. 4558 on 22 April 2024. The notice reads as follows:
“
Gazette Notice No. 4558
Republic Of Kenya
The 
Co-operative Societies Act
(cap. 490)
Inquiry Order
Whereas, on my own accord have ordered for an inquiry into the affairs of Metropolitan National Sacco Limited (C.S 2628) and whereas I am of the opinion that an inquiry be carried into-
(i)
the by laws;
(ii)
working and financial conditions; and
(iii)
the conduct of present or past directors and management of Metropolitan National Sacco Limited (C.S 2628).
And in accordance with section 58 as read together with section 73 of the 
Co-operative Societies Act
, Cap. 490, laws of Kenya.
Now therefore, I authorize; (1) Javel M. Murira, Director·of Co­ operative Audit, (2) David Gitonga Kahuthu (Dr.), Manager, Regulations, (3) Kennedy Ottachi, Principal Co-operative Officer and (,4) Daniel Mue Mwatu, Senior Compliance Officer, to hold an inquiry within fifteen (15) days from the date thereof at such place and time as may be expedient and duly notified by them.
The attention of all officers and members of the society is directed to the following sections of the 
Co-operative Societies Act
.
Section 60 (I)- Cost of Inquiry
Section 60 (2) -Recovery of Costs of Expenses
Section 94 -Offences
Section 73 -Surcharges
Davidk.obonyo.
Commissioner for Co-operative Development.”






16.
Section 9(3) of the 
Law Reform Act
 prescribes six months as the period within an application for the judicial review relief of certiorari is to be made after the impugned order, judgment decree conviction or other proceedings have been made. It reads as follows:
(3)
In the case of an application for an order of certiorari to remove any judgment, order, decree, conviction or other proceedings for the purpose of its being quashed, leave shall not be granted unless the application for leave is made not later than six months after the date of that judgment, order, decree, conviction or other proceeding or such shorter period as may be prescribed under any written law; and where that judgment, order, decree, conviction or other proceeding is subject to appeal, and a time is limited by law for the bringing of the appeal, the court or judge may adjourn the application for leave until the appeal is determined or the time for appealing has expired.






17.
The applicants do not, and indeed cannot dispute the import of this provision of the law with respect to when to file an application for the order of certiorari. However, what they have attempted to do in their submissions is to run away from the inquiry order duly gazetted on 22 April 2022 and, instead alluded to the inquiry report which was presented to the cooperative society’s meeting of 29 October 2022 as their target of the judicial review relief of certiorari. This, of course, cannot be true and, in any event, the argument betrays the applicant’s own pleadings, in particular prayer 1, of the motion which states, in no uncertain terms that:
“
That this Honorable court be pleased to issue orders of certiorari directed to the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 respondents, by themselves their servants and/or agents or any other officer acting under their authority to bring before this court for the purpose of being quashed the 
inquiry order dated 20th April 2022
, for the dissolution of the management and supervisory boards of Metropolitan National Sacco, all administrative actions, decisions or measures initiated or put in process/motion by the Respondents or their agents and hinged or founded on the impugned inquiry report of the servants and/or the1st Respondent.” (Emphasis added).






18.
Without belabouring the point, the applicants are bound by their own pleadings and cannot purport to substitute, in their submissions, the prayer to quash the inquiry order of 20 April 2022 with that of the inquiry report of 29 October 2022.






19.
Besides the applicants being bound by their pleadings, section 9 (1) ( c) of the 
Law Reform Act
 is to the effect that no relief can be granted other than that which was specified when the application was made and for which, of course leave was sought and granted. The section reads as follows:
9.
(1)
Any power to make rules of court to provide for any matters relating to the procedure of civil courts shall include power to make rules of court—
(c)
requiring that, where leave is obtained, no relief shall be granted and no ground relied upon, except with the leave of the court, other than the relief and grounds specified when the application for leave was made.
It follows that the impugned order having been made 22 April 2022, the application for the relief of certiorari ought to have been filed on or before 23 October 2022 when the six months limitation period lapsed.






20.
Unlike the first prayer which is targeted at the inquiry order, the second prayer for the relief of prohibition is targeted at the inquiry report. As far as I understand this prayer, it is to bar the respondents from implementing the report.






21.
In order to clear the air on whether the report has been implemented or not and, therefore, whether the relief of prohibition is available to the applicants, I would be enjoined to interrogate the competing evidence which has been presented before court by way of affidavits. Evaluation of evidence goes beyond what a preliminary objection entails. As was held in Mukhisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co Ltd versus West End Distributors (1969) EA 696, a preliminary objection is concerned about a point of law which has been pleaded or which arises by clear implication out of pleadings and which, if argued as a preliminary point, may dispose of the suit. It raises a pure point of law which is argued on the assumption that all the facts pleaded by the other side are correct and, it cannot be raised if any fact has to be ascertained.






22.
In the same breath, the court may also wish to consider the question of non-disclosure of material facts, among other issues that may arise in the applicants’ application. To the extent that these questions involve interrogation of evidence, they cannot be determined in the context of a preliminary objection; instead, these questions can only be determined at the hearing of the substantive motion.






23.
For the reasons I have given, I hereby sustain and uphold the respondent’s preliminary objection only to the extent that the applicant’s prayer for the order of certiorari is not sustainable. The application shall proceed for hearing on the prayer for prohibition only. Costs shall be in the cause. It is so ordered.

Prosecutor

 Administratrix






Esther Nzula Philip

 Administratrix










Ruling










1.
Before this Court is an Affidavit of protest to the confirmation of grant which was issued to the Administrators on 2
nd
 June 2021.






2.
The basis of the Affidavit of Protest is that although the protestor signed the consent in support of the Summons for Confirmation of Grant, she opposes the proposed mode of distribution set out in the Summons for Confirmation of Grant dated 17
th
 August 2022 and filed on 19
th
 August 2022, on grounds of non-disclosure of the mode of distribution of the deceased’s assets and non-disclosure of the some of deceased’s properties.






3.
In particular, the protestor deposes that one such property is registered in the name of her step-mother, Annah Musili Mutuku. The protestor argues that although the said land is registered in the name of her step-mother, it belongs to the estate of the deceased. It is deposed that the deceased left a will intimating as much and, on this basis, the family agreed that confirmation shall be put on hold until this issue is settled.






4.
The protestor has exhibited a copy of the alleged will marked BMP1; measurements of the property marked BMP2; and a copy of the alleged family meeting dated 1
st
 October 2022, marked BMP3.






Part II: The 1
St
 Administratrix/respondent’s Case


5.
In her Affidavit of Reply, the 1
st
 Administratrix/Respondent in the Summons for Confirmation for Grant, a full disclosure has been made to the effect that the deceased’s estate comprises only two properties namely Muputi/Kiima Kimwe/3462; and Mumbuni/Kasinga/307 and that the protestor signed the consent to distribution of the two properties. It is deposed that the protestor has adduced no evidence to support her assertion.








Part III: The Protestor’s Further Affidavit


6.
In her Further Affidavit dated 21
st
 August 2023, the Protestor deposes that the property which was undisclosed in the said Summons for Confirmation of Grant was bought by the deceased and not the 1
st
 Administratrix and that the 1
st
 Administratrix was merely a witness to the sale as demonstrated in the Sale Agreement. In this regard, the protestor has exhibited a copy of Sale Agreement marked BMP1.








Part IV: Submissions


7.
Both parties filed written submissions. The protestor filed submissions dated 14
th
 September 2023 and the 1
st
 Administratrix filed written submissions dated 24
th
 August 2023 and filed on 25
th
 August 2023. Both submissions have rehashed the substance of their respective positions.






8.
In her submissions, the protestor argues that the land was transferred to the name of the 1
st
 Administratrix fraudulently, staking this proposition in Lawrence Muriithi Mbabu vs. District Land Registrar, Nyeri & another [2019] eKLR.








Part V: Issues For Determination


9.
Gleaning from the Protest and the response thereto, this Court has distilled two questions for determination as follows:
i.
First, whether a Court sitting in its succession jurisdiction is clothed with the requisite jurisdiction to determine ownership of land in circumstances where a Protestor asserts that a certain parcel of land registered in the name of a Petitioner, belonged to the deceased.
ii.
Second, who should bear the costs of this Protest?








Part VI: Analysis Of The Law; Examination Of Facts; Evaluation Of Evidence And Determination


10.
This Court now embarks on analysis of the law, examination of facts, evaluation of evidence and determination of each of the two questions, seriatim.






11.
This Court has noted departure from the procedure and form of an Affidavit of Protest. However, guided by Article 159(2)(D) of 
the Constitution
 which regards such as an undue technicality, this Court has elected to focus on substance of the dispute.






Whether a Court sitting in its succession jurisdiction is clothed with the requisite jurisdiction to determine ownership of land in circumstances where a Protestor asserts that a certain parcel of land registered in the name of a Petitioner, belonged to the deceased


12.
There is no universally accepted definition of jurisdiction. Broadly speaking, jurisdiction is the authority or power granted to a formally constituted legal body to deal with and make pronouncements on legal matters and by implication to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility. In the context of Kenya, jurisdiction of a Court is the authority or power granted to a Court to admit, consider and determine a legal matter on an area of responsibility defined by 
the Constitution
 and/or Act of Parliament and more particularly, the power reposed in a Court to interpret and apply the laws contemplated by Article 2 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya and those set out under section 3 of the 
Judicature Act
. See the locus classicus on this subject namely the Court of Appeal decision in Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” vs. Caltex Oil (K) Ltd [1989] KLR 1, per Nyarangi, JA.






13.
Jurisdiction is not a mere procedural technicality. It flows from either 
the Constitution
 or legislation or both. See the Supreme Court decisions in Samuel Kamau Macharia vs. Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd & 2 Others [2012] eKLR; and In the Matter of Interim Independent Electoral Commission [2011] eKLR.






14.
Since Jurisdiction is everything, the Court must inquire into its jurisdiction before Judgement is rendered. Without it, a Court has no power to make one more step and should instead down tools in respect of the matter before it, the moment it holds the view that it lacks it. See the said Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” case.






15.
Article 2(2) of 
the Constitution
 provides that no person may claim or exercise State authority except as authorised under this Constitution. In the foregoing context, Courts and other public bodies should work within the powers expressly conferred either by statute or legislation of both, but not by implication. Power should not be expanded through judicial craft. See Geoffrey K. Sang vs. Director of Public Prosecutions & 4 others [2020] eKLR, per Odunga, J.; Chogley vs. The East African Bakery [1953] 26 KLR 31 at 33 and 34; Re: Hebtulla Properties Ltd. [1979] KLR 96; [1976-80] 1 KLR 1195; Warburton vs. Loveland [1831] 2 DOW & CL. (HL) at 489; Lall vs. Jeypee Investments Ltd [1972] EA 512 at 516; Attorney General vs. Prince Augustus of Hanover [1957] AC 436 AT 461; Republic vs. Kenya Revenue Authority Ex Parte Aberdare Freight Services Ltd & 2 Others [2004] 2 KLR 530; and Re Hardial Singh and Others [1979] KLR 18; [1976-80] 1 KLR 1090.






16.
It cannot be gainsaid that the jurisdiction of a probate and administration court as defined by the 
Law of Succession Act
 is to determine assets of the deceased, survivors of the deceased and the persons with beneficial interest thereof, and finally distribute the assets amongst the survivors and the persons beneficially interested. See In Re Estate of Alice Mumbua Mutua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR, where W.M. Musyoka, J. held that “26… The 
Law of Succession Act
, and the Rules made thereunder, are designed in such a way that they confer jurisdiction to the probate court with respect to determining the assets of the deceased, the survivors of the deceased and the persons with beneficial interest, and finally distribution of the assets amongst the survivors and the persons beneficially interested. The function of the probate court in the circumstances would be to facilitate collection and preservation of the estate, identification of survivors and beneficiaries, and distribution of the assets. 27. Disputes of course do arise in the process. The provisions of the 
Law of Succession Act
 and the Probate and Administration Rules are tailored for resolution of disputes between the personal representatives of the deceased and the survivors, beneficiaries and dependants. However, claims by and against third parties, meaning persons who a neither survivors of the deceased nor beneficiaries, are for resolution outside of the framework set out in the 
Law of Succession Act
 and the Probate and Administration Rules. Such have to be resolved through the structures created by the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and Rules, which have elaborate rules on suits by and against executors and administrators. 28. The Probate and Administration Rules recognize that, and that should explain the provision in Rule 41(3), which provides as follows - ‘Where a question arises as to the identity, share or estate of any person claiming to be beneficially interested in, or of any condition or qualification attaching to, such share or estate which cannot at that stage be conveniently determined, the court may prior to confirming the grant, but subject to the provisions of section 82 of the Act, by order appropriate and set aside the particular share or estate or property comprising it to abide the determination of the question in proceedings under … the Civil Procedure Rules …’ 29. Clearly, disputes as between the estate and third parties need not be determined within the succession cause. The legal infrastructure in place provides for resolution elsewhere, and upon a determination being made by the civil court, the decree or order is then made available to the probate court for implementation. In the meantime the property in question is removed from the distribution table. The presumption is that such disputes arise before the distribution of the estate, or the confirmation of the grant. Where they arise after confirmation, then they ought strictly to be determined outside of the probate suit, for the probate court would in most cases be functus officio so far as the property in question is concerned. The primary mandate of the probate court is distribution of the estate and once an order is made distributing the estate, the court’s work would be complete. The proposition therefore is that not every dispute over property of a dead person ought to be pushed to the probate court. The interventions by that court are limited to what I have stated above.” See also Kenya African National Traders & Farmers Union vs. Christine Mwikali Mutie & 2 others [2017] eKLR, per Nyamweya, J.






17.
And so, whenever a dispute over ownership of a parcel of land arises in a probate and administration court, a Court sitting in exercise of its probate and administration jurisdiction, lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine such a dispute. It is worse if the dispute will require cancellation of a title. In 
Kenya African National Traders and Farmers Union vs. Christine Mwikali & 8 others, Nairobi Court of Appeal, Civil Appeal Number 145 of 2018
, where Omondi, Kaibuta & Ngenye, JJA, reasoned that at paragraph 28 that ""What this implies is that, a party wishing that the dispute over ownership of a suit land be determined, he or she ought to file a substantive suit before the Environment and Land Court before lodging a claim over land in a probate court. At the point the party goes to a probate court, the issue of ownership of the suit land will have been substantively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; and the probate court will then arrogate itself the rightful jurisdiction of distribution of the estate of the deceased..."" See also In re estate of Muthiani Mutule (Deceased) [2017] eKLR, per C. Kariuki, J.; Re Estate of Alice Mumbua Mutua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR; Re Estate of Alice Mumbua Mutua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR, per W.M. Musyoka, J.; Monica Wangari Njiiri & 4 others vs. Eunice Wanjiru Igamba & Another (2016) eKLR; Kenya African National Traders & Farmers Union vs. Christine Mwikali Mutie & 2 others [2017] eKLR, per Nyamweya, J., et alia.






18.
It follows that the order of things is that a dispute on ownership is settled first before distribution is undertaken. See 
Kenya African National Traders and Farmers Union vs. Christine Mwikali & 8 others, Nairobi Court of Appeal, Civil Appeal Number 145 of 2018
, per Omondi, Kaibuta & Ngenye, JJA; In Re Estate of Alice Mumbua Mutua (Deceased) [2017] eKLR, per W.M. Musyoka, J., et alia.






19.
What then is the way forward? The law contemplates two options.






20.
The first option is to distribute the uncontested properties and the residual property, if any, will be distributed later, after its ownership is resolved. See In re estate of Muthiani Mutule (Deceased) [2017] eKLR, per C. Kariuki, J.; In The Matter of Estate of Gachuru Kabogo Nai Succ No 2830 of 2001; Charles Murithi Kungu vs. Ann Njoki Njenga Nairobi HCCC No. 19 of 2004, et alia.






21.
The second option is to defer confirmation in toto, awaiting determination of ownership of the contested property.






22.
On grounds of avoiding untidy situations in distribution and the necessity to avoid possible awkwardness including but not limited to the possible need to re-open by way of revocation of the distribution for purposes of redistribution of full estate, this is persuaded and elects the second option.








Who should bear the costs of this Protest?


23.
Considering the family relationship of the parties, this Court has found a good cause to depart from the general proposition of law that costs follow the cause.










Part VII: Disposition


24.
Wherefore this Court:
i.
Downs its tools for lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the principal issue raised by the Protestor and effectively strikes out this Protest.
ii.
Directs that confirmation (distribution) of the estate of Philip Mutuku Sila [deceased] as proposed in the Summons for Confirmation of Grant dated 17
th
 August 2022 and filed on 19
th
 August 2022, is hereby deferred to such time when the issue of ownership of the contested parcel of land, shall be settled.
iii.
Directs that each party shall be her own costs.






25.
Orders accordingly.

          (Being an application for extension of time to file an appeal against the  Ruling of the High Court at Nairobi (Riechi, J.) dated 28th July 2023 in High Court Family Division, Probate & Administration Cause No. E1115 of 2020)
        
      






Ruling










1.
Nyonyo Githu, the 1
st
 applicant has, on behalf of the rest of the applicants; Jorome Kamau Githu, Jane Wambui Githu, Jozelle Gathoni Cox, Wambiru Giovanni Cox, Kimberly Wahu Cox and Ashli Bianca Cox, the 2
nd
 to 7
th
 applicants, respectively filed a Notice of Motion application dated 28
th
 September 2023 pursuant to rules 4, 1- 43 and 62 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2020, among other provisions of the law, seeking extension of time to file an appeal against the ruling of the High Court of Nairobi (Riechi, J.) dated 28
th
 July 2023.






2.
The 1
st
 applicant and Stephen Ragui Njoroge and Robert Eric Wambiru, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 respondents respectively are the administrators of the estate of Alice Hottensiah Githu (deceased) who died on 28
th
 January 2019.






3.
In both the application and in the supporting affidavit of the 1
st
 applicant sworn on the even date, the 1
st
 respondent avers that the applicants filed and served their notice of appeal in compliance with rule 75(2) and 77(1) (77 and 79(1) of 2022 Rules) of the Court of Appeal Rules respectively. He attributes the delay to filing their substantive appeal on the part of the high court registry, family division, in obtaining the typed proceedings. It is averred that a request was made via a letter on 17
th
 August 2023 to the deputy registrar for issuance of the typed proceedings with the same not being addressed. Further, that looking through the e-filing case activity page, he found that the file was with the deputy registrar and upon numerous visits to the registry, the last being on 21
st
 September 2023, the 1
st
 applicant found out that the file was in the trial Judge’s chambers awaiting his signature on the re-typed grant and that the Judge was on leave and was to return on 28
th
 September 2023. The applicants state that they later on 26
th
 September 2023 filed with the registry a request via letter dated 25
th
 September 2023 for a certificate of delay which is yet to be issued.






4.
The applicants deposed that they have an arguable appeal which they believe has merit as evidenced in their memorandum of appeal dated 28
th
 September 2023 which challenges the manner in which the learned trial Judge handled the matter, that they have brought the instant application without undue delay, and that the extension of time will not cause hardship or undue prejudice to the respondents. The applicants thus ask this Court to grant the extension of time to enable the proceedings to be typed and to enable the applicants present a complete record of appeal.






5.
In their written submissions dated 7
th
 May 2024 the applicants reiterate their averments in their application that obtaining the typed proceedings is the only challenge they face to filing their substantive appeal. Further, that on 6
th
 May 2024 the registrar’s office informed the 1
st
 applicant that the typed proceedings should be ready although they could not be confirmed as it was alleged that the file was scheduled for mention before the trial Judge on the May 2024 and that he should return on 9
th
 May 2024 for confirmation.






6.
I have considered the application as well as the supporting affidavit and the submission. As for the factors to be considered when determining an application for extension are well settled in many decisions of this Court, including in Paul Wanjohi Mathenge vs. Duncan Gichane Mathenge [2013] eKLR are as follows:
“The discretion under rule 4 is unfettered, but it has to be exercised judicially, not on whim, sympathy or caprice. I take note that in exercising my discretion I ought to be guided by consideration of the factors stated in previous decisions of this court including, but not limited to, the period of delay, the reasons for the delay, the degree of prejudice to the respondent and interested parties if the applications is granted, and whether the matter raises several visits to the court registry issues of public importance...”






7.
The applicants have demonstrated that they are yet to obtain the typed proceedings from the superior court despite efforts to get them through visits to the registry including writing to the registrar of the court. The applicants have annexed documents in form of correspondences addressed to the court that are duly stamped to confirm receipt, a demonstration of the steps taken.






8.
I have also glanced at the memorandum of appeal annexed to the application. The applicants have come in person. I note the grounds raised are argumentative in part. Apart from that defect, I am satisfied that arguable grounds have been raised, deserving of consideration by the Court.






9.
The application is unopposed. No response was filed, whether by replying affidavit or submissions.
I find merit in this application and order:
i.
The application dated 22
nd
 May 2024 be and is hereby allowed, and the time to file and serve the record of appeal is extended;
ii.
The applicant is granted 30 days to file the record of appeal from the date hereof; and to serve the respondents within 21 days from the date of filing;
iii.
The costs of the application be in the appeal.

Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from Ruling of Hon. J. A Agonda, Senior Principal Magistrate in Ruiru Children Case No. E 063 of 2022 delivered on 14th March 2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This appeal arises from a Ruling delivered by the Magistrate Court in Ruiru in respect of Notice of Motion dated 10th January 2023. The Appellant filed the application seeking the following orders:
i.
Spent
ii.
That pending the hearing and determination of the suit, the Applicant be granted regular unsupervised access to the subject minors at a place agreed between the Applicant and the Respondent;
iii.
That pending the hearing and determination of the suit, the Applicant be granted unlimited access to the subject children while at school;
iv.
That pending hearing and determination of the main suit, the Applicant be allowed to access the children during half of the school and public holidays;
v.
That the Plaintiff/Applicant be at liberty to apply for such further or other orders and/or directions as this Honourable Court may deem fit and just to grant.






2.
The Application was supported by the Affidavit sworn by the Appellant on 10th January 2023 and based on the following grounds:
i.
That the best interest, welfare, psychological wellbeing and education of the children, SWMM. and SWM, is of paramount concern to the Applicant;
ii.
That the order of access through phone calls granted by the Honourable Court on 5th December 2022 is not sufficient as the children have frequently indicated to the Applicant that they miss him;
iii.
That the children are currently on school holidays and will resume school in the course of the month without bonding with their father, to the detriment of the children;
iv.
That the Applicant has never been a threat to the children or caused any emotional and/or physical harm to the children as alluded by the Respondent;
v.
That the Applicant does not intend to cause any hard to the children;
vi.
That the children are being denied their right to parental care from their father who is the Applicant;
vii.
That the children have a right to freely interact with their father who has been in their lives since birth;
viii.
That denying the Applicant access to the children is limiting the capacity of the children to bond with their biological father, which is detrimental to the children;
ix.
That the children who are 16 and 12 years, respectively, do not require supervision to interact with their father;
x.
That it is in the best interest of the children that they have unlimited access to both parents;
xi.
It is in the best interests of the minors that the orders sought are granted.






3.
In response thereto, the Respondent filed her Replying Affidavit sworn on 16th January 2023. The Appellant filed a Further Affidavit sworn on 24th January 2023. The application was canvassed by way of written submissions.






4.
Ruling was delivered on 24th March 2023 with orders as follows:
i.
The Respondent shall have actual custody, care and control of the children pending the hearing and determination of the suit;
ii.
The Applicant shall have limited and supervised access to the children on alternate Saturdays from 12pm to 6pm during school holidays. The picking and dropping at Garden City.
iii.
The Applicant is restrained from threatening, harassing, intimidating the Respondent and children.
iv.
The Applicant shall pay school fees and meet school-related expenses for the children. The school fees be paid directly to the school they are currently enrolled in and send the school fees receipts to the Respondent for record purposes.
v.
The Applicant shall take out a medical cover to take care of the medical needs of the children as and when they arise;
vi.
The Applicant to give vacant possession to the Respondent and the children one of the matrimonial houses either in Ruiru or Syokimau and Applicant restrained from visiting the Respondent and the children without consent of the Respondent;
vii.
The Respondent shall provide food, clothing, good grooming, entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses for the children;
viii.
The Applicant shall pay a sum of Kshs 125,000/- every month as contribution to the other needs of the children and the respondent’s sustenance. The money shall be paid to the respondent by fifth day of every month with effect from April 2023, through mobile money transfer;
ix.
This being a family matter, each party shall bear its own costs.






5.
Being aggrieved by the Ruling of the trial court, the Appellant filed Memorandum of Appeal dated 12th February 2024 containing 23 grounds. Parties canvassed the appeal by way of written submissions. The Appellant’s submissions are dated 22nd April 2024, while the Respondent’s submissions are dated 5 June 2024






6.
In his submissions, the Appellant has summarised the issues for determination as follows:
i.
Whether the trial magistrate misdirected herself by ruling on the issues that did not arise in the Application dated 10th January 2023;
ii.
Whether the trial magistrate has the power to issue an order for the sustenance of the Respondent and the extraneous monthly maintenance of Kshs 125,000/=;






7.
I will summarise the issues further to interim access and maintenance, since these are the two main issues in the application dated 10th January 2023.






Analysis and Determination


8.
Article 45 (2) of 
The Constitution
 of Kenya provides as follows:
‘A child’s best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child.’






9.
The 
Children Act
, Cap 141 of the Laws of Kenya elaborates further at Section 8 (1) (a) that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interest of the child shall be of primary consideration.






10.
One of the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant is that the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to appreciate that the prayers sought by the Appellant in the Application dated 10th January 2023 were for access of the children pending hearing and determination of the suit and not for actual custody. The Appellant is also aggrieved by the fact that the trial court granted interim supervised access to the children.






11.
The Appellant’s application was for regular unsupervised access to the children. It is his contention that the children, aged 16 and 12 years, are old enough and supervised access is unnecessary. The Appellant submitted that the trial Magistrate misdirected herself on the facts/issues by dealing with an Application that had not been canvassed by the parties, therefore reaching a decision that was erroneous and to the disadvantage of the Appellant. The Respondent did not submit on this issue.






12.
In its Ruling, the Court observed that the Appellant has not interacted with the children since December 2022, when the Respondent left their matrimonial home with the children. The Court further noted that there is evidence that the Appellant may subject the children to physical harm or emotional torture, thus necessitating the order for supervised access.






13.
With regard to custody and access, section 108 of the Act gives the court the power to make interim orders, as well as the power to review, suspend or vary such orders. The definition of actual custody is clearly stated in section 2 of the Act. It would be remiss for the court to address the issue of access without addressing the issue of which party shall have actual custody of the minors. Besides, it is not in dispute that the children herein reside with their mother, the Respondent.






14.
In the Supreme Court case of MAK v RMAA & 4 others (Petition 2 (E003) of 2022) [2023] KESC 21 (KLR) (Civ) (2 March 2023), the Court opined thus:
“


14.
The society in which children grew up shaped who they were. Having both a mother and father involved in a child’s life could provide significant social, psychological, and health benefits. The stability of having a relationship with both parents could provide security and greater opportunities for children to find their own paths to success. Even if circumstances may warrant limited access to a parent, a court should order supervised access...
...






17.
Courts while making a decision that would impact the child were mandated to consider all circumstances affecting the child. The following guidelines ought to be considered when balancing a child’s best interests and parental rights and responsibilities:
a.
the existence of a PRA between the parties.
b.
The past performance of each parent.
c.
Each parent’s presence including his or her ability to guide the child and provide for the child's overall well-being.
d.
The ascertainable wishes of a child who was capable of giving/expressing his/her opinion.
e.
The financial status of each parent.
f.
The individual needs of each child.
g.
The quality of the available home environment.
h.
Need to preserve personal relations and direct contact with the child by both parents unless it was not in the best interests of the child in which case supervised access to the child was to be granted.
i.
Need to ensure that children were not placed in alternative care unnecessarily.
j.
The mental health of the parents.
k.
The totality of the circumstances.” (emphasis mine)








15.
Although this court has a duty to re-evaluate the application by the Appellant filed in the trial court and come to its own independent conclusion, it is important to note that this court does not have the advantage of seeing and hearing the parties as they canvassed their application. This court’s analysis is limited to the documents placed before it. With this in mind, noting the sentiments of the trial court about the wellbeing of the children, I find no need to interfere with the interim orders regarding actual custody and access to the children.






16.
On the issue of maintenance, section 111(1) of the Act provides as follows:
A parent, guardian or custodian of a child, or an authorised officer, may apply to the Court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make a maintenance order: Provided that on the making, varying, or discharging of a residence, guardianship or custody order, the Court may make a maintenance order for a child notwithstanding the fact that no application has been made to the Court in that regard.






17.
Based on the foregoing and pursuant to the provisions of section 117 of the Act, the trial court was well within its scope and powers to make an order for maintenance of the children, despite the fact that the Application did not seek such prayers. The question before this Court is whether or not the said interim maintenance orders were appropriate or unreasonable under the circumstances.






18.
The Appellant submitted that parental responsibility is a joint responsibility. He argued that while he does not deny that he should contribute towards the upkeep and maintenance of the children, that the Respondent should contribute equally.






19.
It is a right enshrined in 
the Constitution
 that every child is entitled to care and protection by both parents. Both the Appellant and Respondent are responsible for caring, nurturing and raising their children, in the best way possible and bearing in mind their financial capabilities. With this in mind, I find no reason to interfere with orders (iv), (v) and (vii) on maintenance.






20
However, looking at the Application by the Appellant in the trial court and the response thereto, I see no basis upon which the trial court made an additional order of Kshs 125,000/= per month for sustenance and how it arrived at this particular figure. I note that no Affidavits of Means were filed by the parties to determine their financial capabilities.






21.
With regard to the matrimonial home, the jurisdiction of the Children’s court is clearly spelt out in the 
Children Act
. The Court is limited to addressing matters touching on the children, and ought not to delve into the arena of adjudicating matrimonial or other disputes between the parties. I find that in this particular instance, the trial court misdirected itself by issuing an order for possession of the matrimonial home, simply based on an averment in the Respondent’s Replying Affidavit.






22.
The upshot is that the Appeal partly succeeds. I hereby set aside orders (vi) and (viii) of the trial court. The rest of the orders of the Ruling shall remain in force pending the hearing and determination of the suit.

          (Being an appeal against the original conviction and sentence delivered by Hon. E. Boke (S.P.M) on 8th February 2019 at Kibera Chief Magistrate’s Court Criminal Case No. 172 of 2017 Republic vs Andrew Kamau Njoroge and Ian Leiyan Maina)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Andrew Kamau Njoroge and Ian Leiyan Maina, the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 appellants herein were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296 (2) of the penal code. They also faced an alternative charge to count one: handling stolen goods contrary to section 322 (1) of the penal code. They pleaded not guilty and after a full trial were convicted on the two main counts. They were each sentenced to serve twenty (20) years imprisonment on each count. The sentences were to run concurrently.






2.
Being aggrieved, the appellants challenged their conviction and sentence on appeal. In their respective petitions of appeal, and amended grounds of appeal, the appellants complained that the charge sheet was defective for duplicity. They challenged the totality of the prosecution’s evidence against which they was convicted. They argued that their identification was not proper. In addition, the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive. The appellants urged the court to quash their conviction and set aside the sentence imposed.






3.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions which have been duly considered and there is no need to rehash them herein.






4.
Before delving into the specific re-evaluation of the evidence on record, I will deal with the preliminary issue raised by the appellants thus: the charge sheet was defective for duplicity. The appellants contended that they were charged with the offence of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296 (2) are two separate offences intertwined as one. They argued that as a consequence, their conviction on a defective charge sheet was unsafe.






5.
The Court of Appeal in Paul Katana Njuguna v Republic [2016] eKLR considered the issue of duplicity where the appellant had been charged with the offence of robbery with violence contrary to Section 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code. The Court observed as follows;
“
Having considered the law on duplicity as it has evolved, can we say that the charge as framed in the appeal before us was so defective as to have occasioned a failure of justice? Can it be said with any certainty that the said defect is incurable under Section 382 of the Penal Code? We observe that the offence under Sections 295 and 296 (2) were not framed in the alternative. So, following the decision in Cherere s/o Gakuli -v- R (supra) Laban Koti -v- R. (supra) and Dickson Muchino Mahero v R. (supra), the defect in the charge herein is not necessarily fatal.""






6.
In this case, the appellants understood the charge against them, participated in the hearing by cross-examining the witnesses, and mounted their respective defence at the close of the prosecution case. They did not raise any complaint before the trial court and in the circumstance, I find that there was no miscarriage of justice on the ground that the charge was duplex.






7.
This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, re-evaluate, and re-analyse the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence. The court should however bear in mind that it did not see witnesses testify and give due consideration for that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32).






8.
The key ingredients for a robbery with violence charge are found in section 296(2) of the Penal Code. It provides as follows-
“
if the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death”.






9.
As regards the offence of robbery with violence, the issues for consideration by this court are whether the appellants were positively identified and whether the prosecution did prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.






10.
The prosecution case was that on 8th September 2015, David Maina (PW1), a driver, and his conductor, James Thairu Macharia (PW2), were hired by two individuals to transport hay from Narok. After travelling with the 1
st
 appellant they were joined by the 2
nd
 appellant in Narok. The appellants then led them to a remote location. As they neared the supposed destination, two men appeared on the road and they stopped.






11.
When they stopped, one of the men reached into the vehicle, turned off the engine, and a violent assault began by the four assailants. Both PW1 and PW2 were pulled from the truck, beaten, and forced into another car, driven by one of their assailants. The assailants threatened to kill them but they begged for their lives. They were forced to drink a suspicious concoction and then abandoned in an unknown area. They later regained consciousness at a Maasai homestead where they made a phone call to their employer to inform them of their ordeal. They were later taken to hospital for examination and treatment.






12.
PW1 testified that he was robbed of Kshs 4,600 and his phone, while PW2’s spectacles were damaged. After discharge, both men identified their assailants who had been arrested with the stolen vehicle.






13.
Peris Njeri (PW3), the owner of the motor vehicle, received a frantic call from her driver, PW1, shortly after the robbery. Shocked, she immediately reported the theft to the police and used the canter's tracking system to trace its location. The stolen vehicle was eventually found, and she was called in to identify it.






14.
CPL Moses Mwenda (PW4) stationed at Ongata Rongai police station, received a report from PW3’s brother about the missing canter. While investigating, he learned the vehicle had been recovered in Suswa and that the driver and conductor had been assaulted and admitted to Narok Hospital. When PW4 visited the hospital, he found the two men with injuries. He then proceeded to Narok police station, where he saw the suspects, who had been caught with the stolen canter.






15.
CPL Mwangi (PW5), a police officer in Suswa, shared how they set up a roadblock after receiving a tip about the stolen canter. When the vehicle appeared, the appellants were inside. Despite claiming they were sent by their boss, they refused to reveal who it was, leading to their arrest.






16.
The evidence on record does prove that the complainants were lured to Narok town where they were attacked by four assailants among them the appellants. During the attack, they proceeded to steal motor vehicle registration no. KBY 846R Isuzu NKR, a wrist watch, cash, and a phone. During the ordeal, the assailants were armed with a gun that was used to threaten the complainants. In addition, the complainants sustained injuries as a result of their assault.






17.
This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of DR Stephen Nyamai Makau (PW6), from Narok County Referral Hospital testified on behalf of Dr. Ezra Mageto who had examined the complainants but had since left the facility. Upon their examination, they were dizzy and had facial injuries. They were treated for poisoning after indicating that they had been forced to ingest an unknown concoction. He produced their discharge summaries.






18.
In his defence, the 1
st
 appellant gave sworn testimony admitting to selling bhang in Narok County and paying police officers to allow the illegal business. He told the court that he was arrested for possession of five rolls of bhang after failing to pay a bribe. He was detained at Ollasit police post and transferred to Narok police station, where he was unexpectedly charged with robbery instead of drug possession. He denied knowing the complainants and argued that no identification parade was conducted, which would have been necessary if he had been involved in the alleged robbery.






19.
The 2
nd
 appellant stated that on the day in question, he had gone to visit his aunt when he encountered a crowd watching comedians. While observing, two police officers approached and demanded his ID. However, he did not have it and they arrested him. He was taken to Olasit police post, where an officer demanded Kshs 5,000 for his release. Unable to reach anyone, he was transferred to Narok police station and charged alongside a stranger.






20.
Nevertheless, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 contradicts the appellants account. Both witnesses positively identified the appellant, having spent over 20 minutes with them before the robbery. In addition, the 1
st
 appellant was in the company of PW1 and PW2 from Rongai to Narok which was sufficient time to recognise him. The incident also occurred during the day, minimizing the chance of mistaken identity. Additionally, the stolen motor vehicle was found in the possession of the appellants and it was positively identified by PW3 as the vehicle in the possession of PW1 and PW2 at the time of the robbery. Furthermore, the appellant’s failure to provide a credible explanation for his possession of the stolen vehicle further invokes the doctrine of recent possession, which supports the charge of robbery with violence against him.






21.
I have also considered the defence put forward by the appellant and hold that it did not displace the otherwise strong culpatory evidence adduced by the prosecution. I hold that the prosecution proved its case to the required standard of proof on the charge of robbery with violence against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction by the trial court on both counts is therefore affirmed.






22.
On sentence, the trial court sentenced each of the appellants to twenty (20) years imprisonment on each count. During sentencing, the trial court considered their mitigation and that they were first offenders. Although the trial court indicated that the said period had been considered, the court was not specific on what amount of time was considered. Guided by the law, the court is of the view that the period ought to be specifically noted, as failure to do so would amount to denying the applicant a right due to the failure of the court to discharge an obligation bestowed upon it by law (See Ahmed Abolfathi Mohamed v Republic [2018] eKLR)






23.
The upshot of the above is that the appeal is found to be lacking in merit and is dismissed. However, the sentence of twenty years imprisonment imposed by the trial court on counts I and II shall run concurrently from 8
th
 September 2015 date of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 appellant's arrest pursuant to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 Laws of Kenya.




Orders accordingly.

          (An Appeal from the Judgment of the Chief Magistrate, Honourable S.A Opande in Nairobi Civil No. 2479 of 2020, delivered on 6th June, 2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant aggrieved by the decision of the trial court in Nairobi Civil Case No. 2479 of 2020 lodged this appeal. The Respondent also being aggrieved by the decision filed a cross appeal.






2.
The facts of the case are that the Respondent filed a claim before the trial court seeking general damages for pain and suffering, loss of amenities, and special damages of Kshs 3,550/= arising out of personal injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The accident occurred on or about 18/12/2019, involving the Appellant’s motor vehicle, Registration No. KCJ 410N, along the Nyari-Waiyaki Way bypass.






3.
The Respondent's case was that he was a pillion on a motorcycle KMER 680F when the Appellant, by himself or through his authorized agent, controlled, and drove Motor Vehicle Registration Number KCJ 410N so carelessly and negligently at a very high speed that he lost control, causing the said motor vehicle to collide with the motorcycle, thereby causing the Respondent serious bodily injuries namely, a fracture on the left tibia and swelling and laceration on the left knee.






4.
The Appellant, in his statement of defence dated 21/12/2020, denied each and every allegation made against him by the Respondent. On a without prejudice basis, he contended that if the accident occurred, it was caused solely by the negligence of the Respondent.






5.
During the hearing, the Respondent called two witnesses, while the Appellant relied on his evidence.






6.
Upon taking evidence, the trial magistrate came to the conclusion that: -
a.
Liability be apportioned  20% in favour of the Plaintiff as against the Defendant.
b.
General damages of Kshs 500, 000/=.
c.
Special damages of Kshs 3550/=
d.
Costs and interests of the suit from the date of judgment till payment in full.






The Appeal


7.
Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Appellant filed a memorandum of appeal dated 4/7/2023 seeking that the appeal be allowed, the entire judgment of the lower court be set aside, the Respondent’s suit be dismissed with costs, and that the Appellant be granted the costs of the appeal. The Appeal is premised on five (5) grounds as follows: -
a.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in apportioning liability at 80:20% in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant in total disregard of the evidence adduced and the exhibits produced and the finding in item No. 9 of his judgment wherein apportionment of liability was indeed in favour of the Defendant as against the Plaintiff in the ration of 80:20%.
b.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding general damages at Kshs 500, 000/= which award was excessive and unwarranted in light of the evidence adduced.
c.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and in fact in awarding special damages at Kshs 3550/= which claim was not proved and was excessive and unwarranted in light of the evidence adduced.
d.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law in not taking into account entirely the written submissions of the Appellant.
e.
That the Learned Magistrate’s finding and decision were against the weight of the evidence adduced.






8.
The Respondent being equally dissatisfied with the Court’s judgment and decree, filed a Cross Appeal dated 30th November 2023, seeking that the cross appeal be allowed, the trial court’s judgment on quantum set aside and costs of the appeal. The cross-appeal is premised on four grounds, namely: -
a.
That the trial judge erred in law and in fact by failing to appreciate the relevant principles and case law in assessing damages for pain and suffering and thereby arrived at a very low award on general damages.
b.
That the trial Magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly evaluate the evidence on record in particular the evidence on permanent incapacity of the respondent and thereby erroneously failed to award him future medical expenses.
c.
That the Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact in failing to consider the Respondent’s oral and documentary evidence as a whole.
d.
That the trial Magistrate misdirected himself and failed to give any due and proper consideration to the pleadings and evidence on record and submissions of the respondent hence making a very low award and which did not have any legal or evidential justification.






9.
As follow up to the Appeal and Cross Appeal, the Appellant filed his submissions dated 5th June, 2024 in support of his appeal and opposing the cross appeal while the respondent filed theirs dated 8th May, 2024 in support of the cross appeal and opposing the appeal.








Appellant’s submissions


10.
On ground 1 of the appeal the Appellant submits that the Respondent, failed to prove the appellant’s alleged negligence as particularised in the plaint. That while testifying on oath, the respondent confirmed that the motorcycle, registration number KMER 680F, on which he was a pillion passenger, rammed into the rear side of motor vehicle registration number KCJ 410N, which was stationary and parked off the road. Furthermore, PW2, who produced the police abstract, did not provide an excerpt from the occurrence book to show the results of the investigation, he did not visit the scene, he did not investigate or bring the police file hence he urged the court to consider his evidence as hearsay.






11.
The appellant urges the Court to find that the Respondent was negligent and thus blamed for the occurrence of the subject matter because the Respondent did not discharge his burden of proof as per sections 107, 108, and 109 of the 
Evidence Act
 and that the evidentiary burden never shifted. Reliance was placed in the High Court case of Quest Resources Limited v Japana Port Consultants Limited [2015] and the Supreme Court decision in Raila Odinga v IEBC & 3 others [2013] eKLR.






12.
The Appellant urge that the Respondent failed to sued the proper party who is the rider of the motor cycle registration no KMER 680F KMER 680F who was blamed by the police for ramming into the rear of the Appellant vehicle hence he urges the court to hold that the Respondent failed to prove negligence against the Appellant.






13.
On Ground 2 the Appellant submits that the Respondent is entitled to a sum not exceeding Kshs 200, 000/= but considering the injuries sustained as per the medical report of Dr. G.K. Mwaura and Dr. Nathan Wafula as well as the following m S.D.V Transami K. Ltd v Scholastica Nyambura (2012) eKLR and Kemfro Africa Limited t/a Meru Express Service, Gathogo Kanini v A.M Lubia & Olive Lubia [1982-88] 1 KAR 727 the Respondent should be awarded kshs 300,000.






14.
On Ground 3, it is submitted that the Respondent failed to prove the case with the requisite level of detail for special damages. The Appellant relied on his submissions and addressed the cross-appeal by stating that Ground 2 of the Cross Appeal, which pertains to the estimated future medical costs of Kshs 200,000/=, was not supported by an explanation of how the figure was determined. Therefore, the Appellant argues that this amount cannot be awarded.






15.
The Appellant urges the court to allow the appeal and dismiss the cross appeal.








Respondent’s submissions


16.
The Respondent sets out four issues for determination as follows
i.
Whether the trial court erred in his finding on liability
ii.
Whether the award on general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities as awarded by the trial court was too low or too high to warrant interference by this court
iii.
Whether trial court erred in law for not making an award for future medical expenses.
iv.
Whether the trial magistrate erred in law in awarding kshs 3,550 for special damages expenses.






17.
On liability, the Respondent submited that he provided direct evidence proving the Appellant's liability. He further contends that since the Appellant blames the owner of the motorcycle for the accident rather than the Respondent himself, the Appellant should have joined the motorcycle's owner as a party to the suit in the trial court. The Respondent argues that, due to this failure, the Appellant should bear 100% of the liability. Reliance was placed in the case of Pauline Wangare Mburu v Benedict Raymond Kutondo & Another [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal decision in Margaret Waithera Maina v Michael K. Kimaru [2017] eKLR among others.






18.
As to whether the general damages for pain and suffering was too high or too low, the Respondent submitted that, the damages awarded amounting to Kshs 500,000/= were inordinately low. He argues that the trial court failed to apply the correct legal principles in assessing the quantum of damages. The Respondent proposes that an award of Kshs 1,200,000/= would adequately reflect the severity of his injuries. He relied on the case of Patrick Kinyanjui Njama v Evans Jume Mukweyi and Kimathi Muturi Donald v Kelvin Ochieng Aseso [2021] eKLR among others.






19.
The Respondent submits that future medical expenses were pleaded and affirmed by both parties' doctors. Dr. Mwaura’s medical report estimated the cost at Kshs 200,000/=, which was not rebutted. The Respondent therefore argues that, based on the evidence and Court of Appeal decisions, this amount should have been awarded as pleaded. The Respondent contends that the court erred by not providing any reason for the award.






20.
The Respondent finally submits that the special damages were pleaded and proved; therefore, there is no sufficient reason for the court to interfere with the award.








Analysis and Determination


21.
This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and assess the evidence and make its own conclusions. It must, however, keep at the back of its mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence firsthand.






22.
The duty of the first appellate Court was settled long ago in the locus Classicus case of Selle and another Vs Associated Motor Board Company and Others [1968]EA 123, where the court, held as follows;-
“
… this court is not bound necessarily to accept the findings of fact by the court below. An appeal to this court ... is by way of re-trial and the Court of Appeal is not bound to follow the trial Court’s finding of fact if it appears either that he failed to take account of particular circumstances or probabilities or if the impression of demeanour of a witness is inconsistent with the evidence generally.”






23.
Having said this, I have carefully considered this Appeal and the Cross Appeal in its entirety and the two key issues that emerge for my determination are;
i.
Whether the trial magistrate erred in the finding on liability.
ii.
Whether the trial magistrate erred in arriving at his decision on quantum of damages.
Thus, as I address the issues here under, for ease of following, the cross appeal and the submissions therein will be taken as the response to the Appellants appeal;






Whether the learned trial magistrate erred in her finding on liability.


24.
Section 107 (1)of the 
Evidence Act
, Cap 80 Laws of Kenya outlines the burden of proof as follows;
“
Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.”






25.
It then follows that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of the fact shall lie on any particular person.






26.
It must be recalled that the duty to discharge the burden of proof in respect of negligence rests with the plaintiff. In Henderson v Harry E. Jenkins {1969} 3 A.E.R. 756, the court reasoned that:
“
In an action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege, and has the burden of proving that the accident was caused by negligence on the part of the defendants. That is the issue throughout the trial, and in giving Judgment at the end of the trial, the Judge has to decide whether he is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accident was caused by negligence on the part of the defendants and if he is not satisfied the plaintiff action fails.” (See also Veronica Kanorio Sabari v Chinese Technical Team for Kenya & 2 others HCCC No. 376 of 1989 Henry Mwobobia v Muthaira Karauri & Another HCCC No. 104 of 1991)
“The onus is on the plaintiff to prove this case on the legal standard necessary. In a civil case the standard is on a balance of probability.”






27.
As discerned above, this appeal, is on re-assessment, re-evaluation and determination on whether the trial court erred in apportioning liability, simply put, it is a reevaluation of who was to blame for the accident. The scope and extent of the fundamental legal principles on this subject are settled. In the cases of Nandwa v Kenya Kazi Ltd [1988] KLR 488 and Regina Wangechi v Eldoret Express Co. Ltd [2008] eKLR the Court on this issue held that:
“
In an action for negligence, the burden is always on the plaintiff to prove that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant. However, if in the course of the trial there is proved a set of facts which raises a prima facie case inference that the accident was caused by negligence on the part of the defendant, the issue will be decided in the plaintiff’s favour unless the defendant provides same answer adequate to displace that inference.”






28.
It is now necessary, in light of these principles, to reassess the evidence presented before the trial court. The evidence on record clearly establishes that an accident occurred on 18/12/ 2019, involving the Respondent, who was a pillion passenger, resulting in injuries. This incident involved a collision between the Appellant’s motor vehicle, Registration Number KCJ 410N, and the motorcycle, Registration Number KMER 680F.






29.
The Appellant contends that the Respondent failed to explain why he did not sue the motorcycle rider, whom the Appellant claim caused the accident. He further argues that the evidence produced by PW2 was inadmissible as it constitutes hearsay. He notes that PW2 was not the investigating officer, did not produce a sketch plan of the accident, nor an occurrence book from which the details of the police abstract were extracted.






30.
On the other hand, the Respondent asserts that he provided direct and unequivocal evidence establishing the Appellant's liability. The Respondent further argued that since the Appellant blames the rider of the motorcycle for the accident, the Appellant should have initiated third-party proceedings failure to do so should result in the court holding him fully liable.






31.
In rendering its decision on liability, the trial court held as follows:
“


7.
The court has considered the evidence brought forward by the Plaintiff and finds that indeed the Defendant’s Motor Vehicle was stationary and parked off the road with the hazard lights on when motor cycle Registration Number KMER 680F rammed into it. The court chooses to believe the Defendant because he was the driver of the above-mentioned motor vehicle. On the contrary, the rider in charge of the aforementioned motor cycle that rammed into the car did not adduce evidence to corroborate the evidence by the Plaintiff who was a pillion passenger and may not have had the opportunity to see the motor Vehicle at the time of the accident.




Additionally, the Plaintiff’s second witness testimony is disapproved as the court rightfully considers it as hearsay. On this position, the court quotes the case of Subramanian v Public Prosecutor (1956) 1 WLR 965 wherein the court held that evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness may or may not be hearsay. It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement.


8.
Moreover, it is evident that no blame was ever apportioned to the defendant after the occurrence of the accident. However, this is not to say that the Defendant is wholly discharged of any liability that may be owed to him. The Defendant admits to parking his car off the road when the motorcycle rammed into it. It is also important to note that the Plaintiff was simply a pillion passenger and his decision not to include the rider of the motorcycle in the case is questionable as the court anticipates that a suit needs to have all necessary parties in it.




The court relies on the case of 
Vyas Industries v Diocese of Nyeri Civil Appeal No. 23 of 1976
 wherein the court held the plaintiff’ driver 75% to blame for ramming into a unit lorry which was stationary on the road. The case is important to our current case in that the court apportions liability in favour of the Defendant as against the Plaintiff in the ration of 80:20 and the court reiterates its position that the Plaintiff should have enjoined his rider to the suit.”






32.
In sum, the trial court in apportioning liability was guided by the finding that the Appellant had discharged evidence because he was the driver of the above-mentioned motor vehicle; the evidence by the Respondent who was a pillion passenger was not corroborated and he may not have had the opportunity to see the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; and that blame was ever apportioned to the appellant after the occurrence of the accident.






33.
The trial court was also minded not to discharge the appellant off liability since he admitted to parking his car off the road when the motorcycle rammed into it. Further, the trial court faulted the Respondent for failing to include the rider of the motorcycle in the case and find this questionable.






34.
Was the trial court right in arriving at this decision? In the case of Khambi & Another vs Mahithi & Another [1968] EA 70 where it was held that: -
“
It is well settled that where a trial Judge has apportioned liability according to the fault of the parties, his apportionment should not be interfered with on appeal, save in exceptional circumstances, as where there is some error in principle or the apportionment is manifestly erroneous and an appellate court will not consider itself free to substitute its own apportionment for that made by the trial Judge.”






35.
In my appraisal of the evidence, PW1, in his statement dated 27
th
 May 2020 and adopted by the trial court stated that he was a pillion passenger when the driver of motor vehicle KCJ 410 N so negligently drove the motor vehicle at a very high speed that he lost control of the motor vehicle allowing the same to collide with the motor cycle causing him serious injuries. On cross examination, the respondent stated that the motor vehicle moved from the road side and hit the motor bike. That the motor vehicle was in front and they were behind the motor vehicle. The vehicle did not warn on coming on the road motor cycle was about 50-60Km/Hr. He also stated that he did not bring the sketch plans of the scene of the accident. The second witness, PW2, produced a police abstract. However, the abstract did not apportion blame to any party as the investigations were still ongoing.






36.
The Appellant submission was contained in the defendant witness statement dated 1
st
 September 2021. He stated that he parked his motor vehicle No KCJ 410 N off Nyari-Waiyaki way with hazard lights on when the rider of motor cycle registration KMER 680 F who had been riding negligently and recklessly at very high speed rammed into the rear right side of the stationary motor vehicle. That the police blamed the rider of the motor cycle for the accident, he referred to paragraph 7 of the police abstract dated 19
th
 December 2019 in his bundle of documents. On cross examination he stated that his car had parked for more than 1 minute before it was hit and that he had not been called to testify against the rider.






37.
The above evidence of the parties gives two possible scenarios of how the accident occurred. The appellant asserts that the motor vehicle was stationary with hazard lights on when it was hit at the rear. The respondent on one hand states that the motor vehicle was at a very high speed that he lost control and collided with the motor cycle, on the other he states that the vehicle moved from the road side and hit the motor bike.






38.
Guided by the principles already discussed earlier in this decision, it is the duty of the Plaintiff, now Respondent, to prove negligence on the part of the Defendant, the Appellant herein. Based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the Respondent was a pillion passenger who was injured as a result of the collision.






39.
The motorcycle rider was not a party to the suit, as he had neither been sued by the Respondent nor joined as a third party by the Appellant. In their evidence, DW1 faulted the motorcycle rider for the accident, claiming that he rode negligently and recklessly at a very high speed and collided with the rear right side of his motor vehicle. If this was the Appellant's position, I then agree with the respondent’s position that the Appellant ought to have been guided by the provisions of Order 1, Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2020 and joined the rider as a third party, so that the trial court could determine the liability among the Appellant and the rider.






40.
This was buttressed on the case of Benson Charles Ochieng & Another v Patricia Atieno (2013) eKLR where the court held that;
The trial court could not have apportioned liability between the Appellants and a person who was not even a party to the suit. This court is unable to agree with the thrust of the Appellants’ argument which was to the effect that the Respondent ought to be blamed for not enjoining the third-party into the proceedings. This cannot be because it is the Appellants who will bear the consequences of any failure to include the third-party into the proceedings. The decision of Oluoch -Vs- Robinson [1971] E.A. 376 is not therefore of help to the Appellants where they did not plead contributory negligence and where they failed to enjoin the owners of the third-party motor vehicle as a party to the suit. The appeal against the finding by the trial court on liability therefore lacks merit and is hereby dismissed.






41.
Therefore, failure to take-out third-party proceedings by the Appellant resulted in the learned trial magistrate erroneously attributing liability to the Respondent, who was merely a pillion passenger and had no control over the motorcycle. Thus, it was a misdirection on the trial court’s part to assign any blame to the Respondent for the accident. I find that the Appellant is wholly to blame for the accident.






42.
Consequently, I set aside the finding on liability and substitute it with a finding in favor of the Respondent, holding the Appellant liable for 100% of the liability.








Whether the trial magistrate erred in arriving at his decision on quantum of damages.


43.
On quantum, the approach of the Courts to such a situation like in the instant appeal is exemplified by the case of 
Mohammed Mahmoud Jabane v Highstone Butty Tongoi Olenja CA No. 2 of 1986
 KLR 730 wherein Nyarangi J.A stated that:
“
an appellate Court does not interfere with quantum of damages simply because in its opinion the damages awarded is excessive, it only interferes if there is evidence. That the damages have been assessed on wrong grounds or are unreasonable.”






44.
According to Dr. G.K. Mwaura, the Respondent sustained swelling and lacerations on the left knee and leg, as well as a fracture on the middle one-third of the left tibia/fibula. The report dated 15/5/2020, which was not contested, indicated that healing was not complete as the Respondent was still undergoing treatment. In contrast, Dr. W.N. Khamala’s report dated 28/5/2021 stated that the Respondent was not on any active treatment and had resumed normal activities. The investigations showed that the tibia fracture had healed well with normal bone anatomy, and the metal plate was in good condition.






45.
The Appellant contends that the general damages awarded were excessive and that the special damages were neither pleaded nor proved. The Respondent argues that the award of Kshs 500,000/= for general damages was inordinately low compared to the severity of the injuries sustained and has proposed that an award of Kshs 1,200,000/= would be more appropriate.






46.
I wish to state at the outset that the award of general damages is always at the discretion of the trial court. However, this discretion must be exercised judiciously and in accordance with the law. The mandate of an appellate court to interfere with damages awarded by a trial court is limited; it is confined to specific circumstances which include that the award was either inordinately high or low, such that it reflects an erroneous estimate of the damage suffered; or if the trial court took into account irrelevant factors, omitted relevant ones, or applied incorrect legal principles in arriving at the award.






47.
I have reviewed the authorities provided by both parties to the trial court in support of their respective proposals on quantum. I find that the injuries sustained by the plaintiffs in those authorities were different and more severe than the injuries sustained by the Respondent in this case.






48.
Given the evidence on record, I am unable to fault the learned trial magistrate’s award of Kshs 500,000/= as general damages for pain and suffering, considering the injuries sustained by the Respondent. In my view, the award was reasonable. There is no indication that the trial court considered any irrelevant factors or applied incorrect legal principles in arriving at its decision. The award is therefore upheld, except that it shall not be subject to the 20% contribution by the Respondent as determined by the trial court, since the Appellant has now been held fully liable.






49.
Regarding the award of special damages, the Appellant contends that these damages were neither pleaded nor proved by the Respondent. However, upon reviewing the pleadings, I disagree with the Appellant’s submissions. The Respondent had pleaded particulars of special damages in the plaint, and these were substantiated through the production of receipts.






50.
As regard to future medical expenses, the pleadings confirm that the Respondent pleaded future medical expenses of kshs. 200,000/=. Guided by the case of 
Mburu & another v Kinge (Civil Appeal 277 of 2023
) [2024] KEHC 1889 (KLR) (29 February 2024) (Judgment) while quoting the Court of Appeal in the case of Tracom Limited & Another vs Hassan Mohammed Adan [2009] eKLR it was stated:-
We readily agree that the claim for future medical expenses is a special claim though within general damages and needs to be specifically pleaded and proved before a court of law can award it. In the case of Kenya Bus Services Ltd vs Gituma (2004) 1 EA 91, this Court stated:-And as regards future medication (physiotherapy) the law is also well established that although an award of damages to meet the cost thereof is made under the rubric of general damages, the need for future medical care is itself special damage and is a fact that must be pleaded if evidence thereof is to be led and the court is to make an award in respect thereof. That follows from the general principle that all losses other than those which the law does contemplate as raising naturally from infringement of a person’s legal right should be pleaded.
We 
understand that to mean that once the plaintiff pleads that there would need for further medication and hence future medical expenses will be necessary, the plaintiff may not need to specially state what amount it will be as indeed the exact amount of that future expenses will depend on several other matters such as the place where treatment is undertaken
, and if overseas, the strength of the currency particularly Kenya currency at the time treatment is undertaken and of course the turn that the injury will have taken at the time of the treatment. We think that will be necessary to plead (if it has to be pleaded at all) is the approximate sum of money that the future medical expenses will require.(emphasis added)






51.
It is noted that the medical report contained in the Appellant list of Authorities by Dr. Nathan Wafula Khamala opined that the metal plate was in good position and may be removed if the patient wishes. Further, the Respondent medical report by Dr. G.K Mwaura provided for future medical expense removal of implants (Admission, surgery, anaesthesia, nursing care, medication and physiotherapy) at kshs. 200,000/=. The two medical reports speak to each other that they may be need for the removal of the implants hence corroborating each other. Thus, it is my considered view that the trial court ought to have awarded future medical expenses.






52.
To this end, I find that the trial court erred in failing to award future medical expenses and as such I will award future medical expense of Kshs. 200,000/- as prayed in the cross-appeal.






53.
For the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in the Appellant’s appeal, and proceed to dismissed it with no orders as to costs. I find merit in the cross-appeal, to the extent that the Appellants are held 100% liable for the accident and Future Medical expenses of Kshs 200,000/- is awarded. The cross-appeal on the quantum of damages fails.






54.
In the result, I set aside the judgment of the trial court and substitute it with the following:
a.
judgment in favour of the respondent against the appellant in the total sum of Kshs.500,000 as general damages for pain and suffering.
b.
Kshs 3, 550 as special damages.
c.
Kshs 200,000/- as Future Medical Expenses
d.
The appellants shall bear the respondent’s costs in the lower court suit while each party shall bear its own costs of this appeal
e.
The amount shall attract interest at court rates from date of judgment of the lower court until full payment.
Orders accordingly

Ruling










1.
The matter for determination is the notice of motion dated 23.04.2024 filed by the applicant through the Firm of Upendo Allan Advocates seeking for orders that:
i.
Spent.
ii.
Stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of this application.
iii.
The applicant be granted leave to file an appeal out of time from the judgement delivered on 14.02.2024 by Hon. Omwange Jackson.
iv.
Costs be in the appeal.






2.
The application is supported by the affidavit of the applicant who deponed that the impugned judgment was delivered on 14.02.2024 but there was a delay in obtaining a copy of the typed certified judgment from the registry. He further deponed that, there was need to read and comprehend the judgment before deciding on the next cause of action hence the delay was not deliberate. That it was in the interest of justice that the prayers herein be allowed to offer the applicant an avenue to ventilate his grievances as provided for under article 50 of 
the constitution
.






3.
The application herein is hinged on the claim that the appellant was in a breach of a tenancy agreement leading to non-payment of rent arrears in respect to plot number 375 Garissa. The trial court upon considering the pleadings and evidence on record, delivered the impugned judgment against the respondent for an amount of Kes. 440,000/- being the rent arrears, cost of the suit and interest from the date of default. It is this determination that has brought the application herein as the respondent seeks to appeal against the trial court’s finding.






4.
It was urged that the application was made in good faith and that it was in the interest of justice that the applicant be given an opportunity to exercise his right of appeal. This court was therefore urged to allow the prayers sought.






5.
The respondent via a replying affidavit sworn on 30.05.2024 deponed that the applicant was not deserving of the orders sought as he has been undesirous to prosecute the suit herein. That the applicant failed to annex the supposed requests for a typed and certified copy of judgment from the registry to enable this court verify the allegations cited by the applicant.






6.
It was contended that the application herein was filed way after the provided period of filing an appeal thus there was unexplained delay as the same was filed two months after the judgment was delivered. That equity aids the vigilante and therefore, article 159 of 
the constitution
 as invoked by the applicant should not apply in hoodwinking this court to allow the orders sought. Additionally, that the draft memorandum of appeal doesn’t exhibit a chance of the appeal being successful and as such, the application herein should be dismissed for want of merit.






7.
The applicant filed a further affidavit sworn on 18.06.2024 reiterating his reasons for filing the application herein and the appeal out of time. That the application was made in good faith and the same was not intended to delay the respondent from realizing her fruits of the judgment. He urged that in as much as he had no means to raise the decretal sum in full, he desired to be heard by this court.






8.
On submissions, the applicant in his submissions dated 18.06.2024 urged this court to invoke section 79 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 which provides that this court has the discretion to admit an appeal filed out of time as long as there is a good cause for not filing the same in time. Further reliance was placed on the case of Mugo and Others vs Wanjiru & Another [1970] EA482 where the court held that despite a party filing an appeal out of the stipulated provisions, the same did not mean that the said appeal ought to be refused.






9.
I have considered the application herein, the response thereof and the rival submissions by counsel. The only issues that crop up for determination are; whether the applicant has met the threshold for grant of stay of execution orders; secondly, whether the applicant has demonstrated sufficient ground for grant of leave to appeal out of time.






10.
The principles guiding grant of a stay of execution order pending appeal are well settled. These principles are provided for under Order 42 rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides:
“
No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.






11.
Further to the above, stay may only be granted for sufficient cause. It is trite that in deciding whether or not to grant a stay, a court must take into consideration the overriding objective stipulated under sections 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
. Thus, a Court is not strictly limited to the traditional provisions for consideration in granting stay of execution orders.






12.
Therefore, a litigant seeking stay of execution of a decree or order pending appeal is obliged to satisfy the conditions set out in Order 42 Rule 6(2), aforementioned namely; (a) that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made, (b) that the application has been made without unreasonable delay, and (c) that such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on the applicant has been given.[See Antoine Ndiaye vs African Virtual University [2015] eKLR].






13.
As to what substantial loss is, it was observed in James Wangalwa & Another vs Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR, that:
“
No doubt, in law, the fact that the process of execution has been put in motion, or is likely to be put in motion, by itself, does not amount to substantial loss. Even when execution has been levied and completed, that is to say, the attached properties have been sold, as is the case here, does not in itself amount to substantial loss under Order 42 Rule 6 of the CPR. This is so because execution is a lawful process. The applicant must establish other factors which show that the execution will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the applicant as the successful party in the appeal ... the issue of substantial loss is the cornerstone of both jurisdictions. Substantial loss is what has to be prevented by preserving the status quo because such loss would render the appeal nugatory.”






14.
In the instant case, the applicant avers that he stands to suffer substantial loss of over Kes. 440,000/- being the rent arrears, cost of the suit and interest from the date of default if stay of execution is not granted. On the part of the respondent, it has simply been urged that the applicant does not deserve the said orders as equity does not aid the indolent.






15.
The court, in RWW vs EKW [2019] eKLR, considered the purpose of a stay of execution order pending appeal, in the following words:
“
The purpose of an application for stay of execution pending an appeal is to preserve the subject matter in dispute so that the rights of the appellant who is exercising the undoubted right of appeal are safeguarded and the appeal if successful, is not rendered nugatory. However, in doing so, the court should weigh this right against the success of a litigant who should not be deprived of the fruits of his/her judgment. The court is also called upon to ensure that no party suffers prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs.
9.
Indeed to grant or refuse an application for stay of execution pending appeal is discretionary. The Court when granting the stay however, must balance the interests of the Appellant with those of the Respondent.”






16.
The applicant did not demonstrate that the respond was not in a position to refund the decretal sum if paid and the appeal succeeds. I do not find any likelihood of the applicant suffering any substantial loss that cannot easily be compensated or recovered monetarily against the respondent who is a land lady.






17.
In regards to whether the application was inordinately filed, the applicant urged that it took some time before he received a typed certified copy of the impugned judgment hence the cause of the delay. It was also urged that the applicant was desirous to exercise his right of appeal and be heard as provided for by 
the constitution
. Given the circumstances herein, I am satisfied that there has been no inordinate delay in bringing the instant application/appeal as the judgment and decree being appealed against was delivered on 14.02.2024 and the memorandum of appeal filed on 23.04.2024 hence a delay of about two months. [See Phillip Chemwolo & Another v Augustine Kubende (1982-88) KAR 103 at 1040].






18.
Whether the appeal will be rendered nugatory if the orders sought are not granted, the court is guided by Article 50(2) of 
the constitution
 on the right to fair hearing which includes the right to appeal. Unless the appeal is completely hopeless, a litigant should be facilitated and be allowed to exhaust his legal remedy on appeal to the highest level possible. In the circumstances of this case, the appeal will be rendered nugatory if leave to appeal is not granted and subsequently, stay of execution granted.






19.
As to security of costs, nothing was submitted on the same. However, this court has the discretion to make appropriate orders to serve the interest of justice.






20.
Taking all the above factors into account and in order not to render the intended appeal nugatory as well as to give effect to the overriding objective of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, I find and hold that the applicant has fulfilled the requirements for grant of stay of execution pending appeal as stipulated under Order 42 Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules. On the other hand, the respondent is entitled to the fruits of her judgment.






21.
Accordingly, the applicant’s/appellant’s application is allowed on the following conditions:
i.
That the applicant/ appellant shall deposit the entire decretal sum into an interest earning account in a reputable commercial Bank, to be held by both advocates for the parties to this appeal, within 30 days of this ruling;
ii.
That leave to appeal out of time is hereby granted and the draft memorandum of appeal filed herein deemed as duly filed.
iii.
That the appellant to file a record of appeal within thirty (30) days of delivery of this ruling;
iv.
Should the applicant fail to abide by order(i) and (ii)above, then the appeal shall stand dismissed.
v.
Costs shall be in the cause.

Ruling










1.
The applicant was charged and convicted for various offences under the 
Kenya Defence Forces Act
. After a full trial, he was sentenced as follows: Charge one, 6 months imprisonment; charge two, 9 months imprisonment; charge three 6 months imprisonment; charge four, 6 months imprisonment; charge five, 9 months imprisonment; charge six, 6 months imprisonment; charge seven, 1 year imprisonment and charge eight, 1 year imprisonment. The sentences were to run concurrently.






2.
He has now filed an application seeking revision of sentence. He filed an affidavit in support of his motion. The arguments raised are that the trial court failed to consider the time she spent in reman custody during the computation of sentence under the provision of section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 of the Laws of Kenya.






3.
I have considered the application, the affidavit in support and the applicable law. I have also considered the trial court record. The issue for consideration is whether the trial court considered the time the applicant spent in remand custody.






4.
The proviso to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to consider the time already spent in custody. The duty to take in account the period an accused person had remained in custody in sentencing under the proviso to section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which is couched in mandatory terms was acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs. Republic [2018] eKLR and Bethwel Wilson Kibor vs. Republic [2009] eKLR and more recently in the High Court case of Vincent Sila Jona & 87 others vs Kenya Prison Service & 2 others [2021] eKLR.






5.
It is therefore clear that it is mandatory that the period which an accused has been held in custody prior to being sentenced be considered in meting out the sentence where it is not hindered by other provisions of the law.






6.
From the record, the applicant was arrested on 13
th
 February 2021 and was never released on bond/bail during the entirety of his trial. He was convicted on 26
th
 June 2024. From the record, it is clear that the period was not factored in during his sentencing. Guided by the law, the court is of the view that the application ought to be considered, as failure to do so would amount to denying the applicant a right due to the failure of the court to discharge an obligation bestowed upon it by law.






7.
I thus allow the application. In the premises, I make the following orders: the sentence imposed by the Court Martial shall run from 13
th
 February 2021, the date of the appellant’s arrest, pursuant to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 75 Laws of Kenya.




Orders accordingly.

          (Appeal arising out of the judgment, conviction and sentence of Hon. S.N Makila (PM) in Kitale Chief Magistrate’s Court Criminal Case (S.O.) No. E240 of 2021 delivered on 23rd February 2023)
        
      






Judgment










Background:


1.
Kevin Kimutai Chesari, the Appellant herein, was charged with the offence of Defilement contrary to section 8(1)(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006.






2.
The particulars of the offence are that; on diverse dates between 16
th
 March 2021 and 6
th
 October 2021 at [particulars withheld] within Trans-Nzoia County, intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of M.C.N a child aged 15 years.






3.
The Appellant faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006.






4.
The particulars of the alternative charge are that on diverse dates between 16
th
 March 2021 and 6
th
 October 2021 at [particulars withheld] within Trans-Nzoia County, intentionally touched the vagina of M.C.N a child aged 15 years with your penis.






5.
A total of four witnesses testified for the prosecution. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the Appellant was placed on his defence.






6.
The Appellant was the sole defence witness. He gave sworn evidence.






7.
Upon considering the totality of evidence presented, the Learned Trial Magistrate found the Appellant guilty of the main offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He was subsequently sentenced the Appellant to 20 years’ imprisonment.








The Appeal:


8.
The Appellant was dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence. Through an Amended Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant urged this Court to quash his conviction and to set aside his sentence on the following grounds: -


1.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and in fact by failing to note that the medical report presented by the prosecution witnesses does not conclusively and strongly point to pregnancy as alleged by the victim to the accused.






2.
That the Investigating Officer herein failed to investigate or carry out investigations from both sides to prove whether there was a relationship between the accused person and the victim.






3.
That the trial magistrate erred in both law and fact by failing to note that the appellant’s absolute rights were violated, infringed and contravened before being produced in court by holding him in police custody for long without cogent reasons.






4.
That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to consider the mitigation and defence of the Appellant before sentencing.






5.
That the Appellant humbly prays to adduce further mitigation during the hearing and determination of this Appeal.










The Appellant’s Submissions:


9.
The Appellant urged its case further through written submissions dated 7
th
 November 2023.






10.
The Appellant argued that the sentence of 20 years was informed by his absence in Court on the judgment date, a position the trial Court observed, painted him in bad light. He urged this Court to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the trial Court’s findings.






11.
In rebutting the incidence of penetration, the Appellant submitted that he was never tested to confirm that he was responsible for the pregnancy. It was his case that the pregnancy was not necessarily evidence of penetration.






12.
The Appellant submitted further that as per the finding of the Supreme Court in Petiti
on No. 15 of 2015
, Francis Karioko Muruatetu & Another -vs- Republic the trial Court ought to have exercised discretion in sentencing and balanced the retributive function of punishment but not sacrifice him at the altar of deterrence.






13.
It was his submission that the trial Court ought to have utilized its discretionary power by considering his mitigation. Reference was made to the decision in R-vs- Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 where it was observed;
The legislative policy was not to create a straight Jacket for Judges… (and) the amendments were not introduced as a form of mandatory sentencing, but rather were intended to provide further guidance and structure to judicial discretion.






14.
In conclusion, the Appellant submitted that the sentence was illegal and inordinately excessive. It was his position that according to the evidence of PW1, there was no penetration since the external genitalia of the victim was okay and there was no discharge.








The Respondent’s case:


15.
The Respondent opposed the appeal though written submissions dated 6
th
 November 20023. It was its case that, based on the decision in Daniel Wambugu Maina -vs- Republic (2018) eKLR, it proved penetration, age and identity of the perpetrator beyond reasonable doubt.






16.
It urged that the appeal be dismissed and the trial Court’s conviction and sentence upheld.








Analysis:


17.
This being a first appeal, this court is duty bound to re-consider and to re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial Court with a view to arriving at its own independent conclusions and findings. (See Okono vs. Republic [1972] EA 74).






18.
While re-assessing the evidence, this Court is required to take cognizance of the fact that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses as they testified before the trial Court and, therefore, it ought to give due regard in that respect as so held in Ajode v. Republic [2004] KLR 81.






19.
Before delving into the issues, there was a preliminary issue that was raised by the Appellant. He alleged that his constitutional rights were infringed in being kept in custody more than what is legally prescribed.






20.
Although quite pertinent, the issue was not raised before the trial Court as to escalate before this Court on appeal. The issue is, therefore, improperly raised. Therefore, the resolution of that issue is not within the ambit of this Court. It is a distinct issue whose resolution resides in a constitutional Court.






21.
The Court now turn to the substantive issues in the appeal.






22.
For the prosecution to establish the charge of defilement, it must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following critical ingredients:
a.
Age of the complainant;
b.
Proof of penetration;
c.
Identification of the perpetrator.






23.
A consideration of the issues now follows vis-à-vis the evidence presented at the trial Court.








Age of the complainant:


24.
The Age Assessment Report was produced as P. Exh2(a) by PW4, a Community Oral Health Officer. It was dated 13
th
 October 2021. It approximated the complainant’s age as 15 years old.






25.
Further, PW2, the complainant’s mother, stated that the complainant was born on 26
th
 June 2007. A computation of the period when the defilement occurred places the complainant at the transition period between 14 and 15 years old.






26.
With the foregoing evidence and having in mind the fact that there was no contest as regards the age of the complainant, it is the finding of this Court that the assessment of the Complainant’s age as 15 years old was proper and it was, therefore, proved beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was a minor in law.








Penetration:


27.
Nelson Lusiola testified as PW1. He was the Clinical Officer attached at the Kitale County Teaching and Referral Hospital. He gave evidence on behalf of Fripila Olunga who had since been transferred from the Hospital.
PW1 produced the P3 Form in evidence. Therein, he stated that his colleague saw the complainant on 13
th
 October 2021. She complained of defilement by a person known to her. It was his evidence that upon examination, Fripila established that the Complainant’s hymen was torn but her external genitalia was okay and that there was no discharge from the private parts.






28.
PW1 noted, however, that the complainant was 38 weeks pregnant.






29.
The complainant testified as PW2. It was her evidence that she was a Form 1 student at Chesta Girls Secondary School. She averred that on 3
rd
 March 2021, the Appellant went to her home whilst her mother was away and asked her to go with him to a neighbour’s house by the name ‘Dolphine’ where he started touching her, undressed and eventually had sex with her. She stated that the Appellant used his private parts and inserted into her private parts.






30.
It was further her evidence that in April 2021, the Appellant came yet again to Dolphine’s house and they had sex again. This time she claimed that her mother had left home to attend a funeral.






31.
She testified that in July 2021 the Appellant called her again and had sex. It was her evidence that they had sex about three times and realized later in school in the month of September that she was pregnant.






32.
The complainant claimed that the sexual assault began when she was in Standard 8. She stated that she had not had sex with any other person other than the Appellant.






33.
On cross-examination she stated that the Appellant’s hand was plastered after an accident, but he used the one that was not broken.






34.
From a careful reanalysis of the foregoing, the Complainant’s evidence even without the Clinical Officer’s is enough proof that indeed the two were involved in a sexual encounter not once but thrice between the period on March 2021 and July 2021.






35.
The Complainant was candid on what happened. She was conscious of their actions and knowledgeable enough to know what they did. She stated that the Appellant inserted his private parts into hers.






36.
With that, the provisions of Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 come to mind. It defines penetration as follows;
the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person






37.
In this case, the Complainant’s own account of the events coupled with PW1’s evidence that her hymen was torn and that the complainant was pregnant was sound proof that penetration did occur.








The perpetrator:


38.
The complainant’s uncontroverted evidence was that she and the Appellant had three sexual encounters on diverse dates between March and July 2021.






39.
The Appellant was well known to the Complainant. The evidence of identification was that of recognition.






40.
The thrust of the Appellant’s defence was that since he was plastered in one of his arms, after an accident, he therefore, was unable to have committed the sexual offence.






41.
The nexus between the plastered arm and the Appellant’s inability to commit the crime was not drawn to the satisfaction of this Court. The Appellant needed to show through medical evidence that he was unable to have sex as a result of the injured arm. That, he failed to do.






42.
Moreover, the foregoing was rebutted when the complainant stated that the Appellant used the hand that was not broken.






43.
The totality of the foregoing affirms the complainant’s position that indeed it was the Appellant who had sex with her and eventually impregnated her.






44.
Having proved the three ingredients in favour of the prosecution, this Court finds that the offence of defilement was proved and that the perpetrator was the Appellant. As such, the appeal on conviction is unsuccessful.








Sentence:


45.
As regards the sentence my attention is directed to the Supreme Court decision in Petiti
on No. E018 of 2023
 Republic -vs- Joshua Gichuki Mwangi delivered on 12
th
 July 2024.






46.
The Learned Judges remarked on sentences in respect to offences under the 
Sexual Offences Act
. They affirmed that until proper challenges were made and determination made in respect of the constitutionality of the sentences in the 
Sexual Offences Act
, Courts must render such sentences without exception.






47.
The Appellant herein was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.






48.
The Appellant was charged under Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the Sexual Offenses Act. The penalty under Section 8(3) is prescribed as follows: -
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years.






49.
Although the sentence was passed before the pronouncement by the Supreme Court, the trial Court, rightly so, rendered the sentence prescribed in law.






50.
The appeal on the sentence equally fails.








Disposition:


51.
As I come to the end of this judgment, I wish to render my unreserved apologies to the parties in this matter for the delay in rendering this decision. The delay was occasioned by the fact that since my transfer from Nairobi, I have been handling matters from the Constitutional & Human Rights Division, Kitale and Kapenguria High Courts. Further, I was appointed as a Member of the Presidential Tribunal investigating the conduct of a Judge in March 2024 thereby mostly being away from the station. Apologies galore.






52.
In the premises the following final orders hereby issue: -
a.
The appeal is wholly without merit and is hereby dismissed.
b.
File marked as CLOSED.






53.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
The plaintiff filed a plaint dated 30th July, 2024 seeking the following reliefs;
a)
) A declaration that the elections conducted by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants in Chemalul Zone on 28/06/2024 and announced 29/06/2024 were not free and fair and were marred with irregularities.
b)
An order invalidating the election results that were announced 29/06/2024 by the 2nd Defendant.
c)
An order cancelling the certificate issued to the 1st Defendant by the 2nd Defendant that declared the 1st Defendant as Director-Elect Chemamul Zone;
d)
An order barring the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants and tea growers from inaugurating, swearing in and/or confirming the 1st Defendant on 17 July, 2024 as the Director representing tea growers in Chemamul Zone.
e)
An injunction barring the 1st Defendant from being sworn in on 17 July, 2024, participating in the meetings and events organised by the 3rd Defendant, purporting to represent Chemamul Zone as a director and/or undertaking the roles of a director for the 3rd Defendant.
f)
An order directing the 2nd, 3rd & 4th Defendants to undertake a repeat election of director in Chemamul Zone as provided for in clause 4 (2) & (8) of the Elections Manual.
g)
Each party to bear its/his own costs.
h)
Any other relief this honourable court may deem fit to grant.






2.
The plaintiff David Kimutai Rono swore a verifying affidavit in support of the plaint and filed a list of witnesses and list of documents alongside his plaint.






3.
The plaintiff’s case was that the High Court of Kenya directed the 2nd, 3rd & 4th respondent to declare the directors’ position vacant and hold the elections on or before the end of June, 2024. The 3rd defendant with the support of the 2nd and 4th Defendants organised to hold its directors’ elections on 28th June, 2024 between 7AM and 3PM, however, the elections got delayed. That the voting materials were delivered by the 2nd Defendant at 4PM when the elections commenced and went on till past midnight of 28th June, 2024. The plaintiff’s claim against the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants is that the voting exercise which was done in the night were marred with many irregularities, voter buying, manipulation and intimidation of voters causing more than 3,000 voters to shy away hence a low voter turnout. The plaintiff set out the particulars of election irregularities, intimidation and violation in paragraph 8 (a) - (q) of the plaint. The plaintiff is adamant that the results of the said elections in Chemamul Zone that declared the 1st Defendant as the director-elect should be cancelled and fresh elections done.






4.
In response, the 1
st
, 2
nd
 & 3
rd
Defendants three replying affidavits by Isaiah Langat, William Chepkwony and Cosmas Korir, respectively. The Defendant's case is that the elections in question were held pursuant to a court order issued by the High Court sitting in Nairobi in Constitutional Petiti
on no. E254 of 2020
 (Constitutional Petiti
on no. E243 of 2020
 &E083 of 2021), the said order specifically directed that smallholder tea factories conduct their Directors’ elections by the end of June, 2024. The Defendants conceded that the elections commenced at about 3.00 P.M on 28
th
 June, 2024 owing to logistical challenges suffered by the 2
nd
 Defendant(IEBC) in distribution of voting materials courtesy of the so called “Gen Z Protests” that crippled co- ordination of activities between its headquarters in Nairobi and the subject electoral areas.The elections commenced about 3.00 P.M on 28
th
 June,2024, upon a consensus reached between all the contestants and other stakeholders including but not limited to, agents of the 4
th
 Defendant being the industry regulator. Moreover, that it was imperative to have the consensus to proceed with the elections, the delay notwithstanding as there was need to abide by the timelines set out by the High Court in Constitutional Petiti
on no. E254 of 2020
. Overall, the Defendants contend that the Plaintiff’s assertions are not backed by any evidence , and that the elections held on 28
th
 June, 2024, were peaceful, credible, free and fair in spite of the various logistical challenges posed by the prevailing political situation in the country, at the time. The Defendants contend that the Elections Manual clearly provided for the membership of the Disputes Resolution Committee and gave an elaborate procedure and clear timelines for purposes of lodging, hearing and determination of disputes which the Plaintiff disregarded.






5.
This court issued directions that the suit be dispensed by way of affidavit evidence and submissions.






6.
David Kimutai Too, the plaintiff on his part, filed a sworn affidavit dated 31
st
 July, 2024. He avers that he applied to vie for directorship in the 2024 polls but was disqualified by the mere fact that he holds two grower numbers and that he made efforts to present a formal complaint. He avers that he wrote a letter of complaint challenging refusal by the IEBC to clear him to contest for directorship elections on 28th June, 2024 to the chairman of the elections dispute resolution committee. He avers that the vague nature of the clauses of the election manual setting up the dispute resolution mechanism provided robust grounds to delay and/or frustrate dispute resolution. He further avers that upon being barred from vying, he opted to support the candidate of his choice and was subsequently appointed as a polling centre agent at Kiptome Polling Station for one Ezekiel Cheruiyot. He avers that on the material day tea growers started casting their votes at around 4PM when polling materials arrived at the polling centre and that Chememul Electoral Zone has more that 5,000 registered growers who are eligible to vote ,however, 2,245 registered growers voted on 28th and 29th June, 2024 owing to the delay in polls and many including women and members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church failed to turn up to cast their votes. He avers that as a polling centre agent he witnesses several anomalies that affected the final result including but not limited to the predetermination of candidates, lack of voter verification, anomalies in the voter register, campaigning of election day, presence of provincial administration in the polling centres thereby intimidating voters and a vague dispute resolution mechanism. He avers that Ezekiel Cheruiyot the aspirant who lost the elections also swore an affidavit citing irregularities and election malpractices that resulted in flawed election. He further avers that the affidavit is in support of the application for orders to declare the elections in Chemamul Electoral Zone of Momul Tea Factory PLC conducted by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants as a sham, marred with irregularities and election malpractice and thereby nullify the election of the 1st Defendant and order fresh election in Chemamul Zone.






7.
The Defendant's case was further supported by the affidavits of evidence of the 1
st
 Defendant, Isaiah Kipkoech Langat, William Chepkwony, the 3
rd
Defendant’s Company Secretary both sworn on 27
t h
 August, 2024 and one by the Returning Officer namely, Cosmas Korir.






8.
Isaiah Kipkoech Langat the 1st respondent avers that he was elected as a director of the 3rd defendant pursuant to elections held on 28th June, 2024. He avers that the elections commenced at about 3PM on 28th June, 2024 owing to logistical challenges suffered by IEBC in distribution of voting materials on the account of Gen Z Protests that crippled coordination of activities between its headquarters in Nairobi and the subject electoral areas. He avers that the elections commenced at 3PM on 28th June, 2024 upon a consensus reached between all the contestants and stakeholders. He avers that they were advised by agents of IEBC that it was imperative to have consensus to proceed with the elections as there was need to abide with the timelines set out in the High Court Constitutional Petiti
on No. 254 of 2020
. He avers that contrary to the plaintiff’s assertions that the elections held on 28th June, 2024 were credible, free and fair in spite of the various logistical challenges posed by the prevailing political situation in the country, at the time. He avers that all contestants were satisfied with the results as is evident from the election declaration forms which were all duly signed by the contestants’ respective agents and that no complaint was ever lodged by any aggrieved contestant as required under regulation 8 of the elections manual. He avers that the instant suit is incompetent for want of capacity on the plaintiff part noting he was neither a contestant in the said election nor submitted any form of authority to sue or otherwise bring this claim on a representative capacity.






9.
William Chepkwony, the 3
rd
Defendant’s Company Secretary filed an affidavit. He avers that the election exercise was conducted on 28th June, 2024, pursuant to a court order that specifically directed that smallholder tea factories conduct their directors’ elections by the end of June, 2024. He avers that he is aware that the election manual for election of directors for small holder directors provides a clear mechanism for dispute resolution and that the said elections manual is a public record duly availed in the Tea Board of Kenya’s website. He avers that the elections manual, moreso regulation 7 provides a detailed procedure for handling complaints. He avers that this court ought to take cognisance of the fact that no contestant lodged any complaint or suit following the 1st Defendant’s triumph as Director Elect representing the 3rd Defendant in Chemamul Electoral Zone.






10.
Cosmas Korir a duly appointed Returning Officer for Momul Tea Factory Limited in Kericho County authorised by IEBC, the 2nd defendant herein. He avers that he is aware that the elections in question were originally scheduled to commence at 7AM and conclude at 3PM on the 28th June, 2024. He avers that the elections commenced later than initially scheduled due to logistical challenges as a result of the Gen Z Protests and that the said delay was communicated to all parties. He avers that elections commenced at 3PM on 28th June, 2024 and to ensure that all eligible voters had the opportunity to cast their votes, the voting hours were extended to compensate for the hours lost. He avers that special priority was given to members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, women and the elderly, to vote early thereby mitigating the impact of the delay. He avers that during the said elections, he and other presiding officers worked tirelessly to ensure that all the procedural and legal requirements were strictly adhered to and categorically denied the occurrence of any irregularities or malpractice in the conduct of the said elections. He avers that the presence of administrative police officers during the elections was in line with IEBC Policy and for the purpose of providing security and maintaining law and order during the conduct of the elections.






11.
The parties filed their written submissions which this court has duly considered.






12.
The plaintiff filed his submissions and contended that the application to contest for directorship and clearance was riddled with influence by both internal and external factors and as a result he was barred from vying for directorship. The plaintiff contended that based on the scanty information in the election manual, the dispute resolution mechanism envisaged in the manual was untenable. The plaintiff contended that the 2nd defendant did not explicitly set up a formal office and dispute resolution committee as envisaged in the elections manual and therefore upon being denied the opportunity to vie, he wrote a letter of complaint and attempts to reach out to the dispute resolution committee were futile.






13.
The plaintiff urged this court to find that the elections of the director for Chemamul Electoral Zone were marred with irregularities from nomination to the casting of votes and therefore declare the same as a sham and have the election results nullified. The plaintiff cited the Ugandan case of Joy Kabatsi Kafura v. Anifa Kawooya & Another , Election Petiti
on No 25 of 2005
 (unreported) where the court held that: “An election is a process encompassing several activities from nomination of candidates through to the final declaration of the duly elected candidate. If any one of the activities is flawed through failure to comply with the applicable law, it affects the quality of the electoral process, and subject to the gravity of the flaw, it is bound to affect the election results at every polling station. If any declaration is invalid by reason of non- compliance with the applicable law, it affects the quality and result of the electoral process.”






14.
The plaintiff conceded that he was aware that where there is a clear dispute resolution mechanism, the same should be followed. The plaintiff cited the case of Kimani Wanyoike v Electoral Commission & another [1995] eKLR where the court held as follows; “where there is a clear procedure for the redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed.” However, the plaintiff contended that in the impugned 2024 elections, the dispute resolution mechanism was not cohesive, he was unaware of the members constituting the dispute resolution committee and the location of the office of the said members.






15.
The plaintiff submitted that the elections were marred with irregularities and electoral malpractices. The plaintiff contended that non compliance with the provisions and principles of the electoral law grossly affected the results of the elections. He relied on article 81 of 
the Constitution
 which sets out general principles of the electoral system and case of James Omingo Magara v Manson Onyongo Nyamweya & 2 others [2010] eKLR where Justice Musinga as he then was observed as follows; “The court has to consider whether the grounds raised in the petition significantly challenge the entire electoral process and lead to ac conclusion that the process was not transparent, free or fair. It is not just a question of who got more votes than the other. It cannot be said that the end justifies the means. In a democratic election the means by which a winner is declared plays a very important role. The votes must be verifiable by the pater trail left behind, it must be demonstrated that there existed favourable circumstances for a fair election and that no party was prejudiced by an act or omission of an election official.”






16.
The plaintiff submitted the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents jointly caused irregularities in the elections held on 28th June, 2024 and therefore this court should find that the said elections were marred with irregularities and grant the orders in the plaint dated 12th July, 2024.






17.
The 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants filed joint submissions, they submitted that it is trite law before a party invokes the jurisdiction of the court, they first ought to exhaust all the administrative remedies in place and cited the case Geoffrey Muthiga & another v Samuel Munga Henry & 1756 others [2015] eKLR of where the Court of Appeal stated that; “It is imperative that where a dispute resolution mechanism exists outside courts, the same be exhausted before the jurisdiction of the courts is invoked. Courts ought to be the fora of last resort and not the first port of call the moment a storm brews within churches, as is bound to happen. The exhaustion doctrine is a sound one and serves the purpose of ensuring that there is a postponement of judicial consideration of matters to ensure that a party is first of all diligent in the protection of his own interest within the mechanisms in place for resolution outside of courts. This accords with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 which commands Courts to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution.” The defendants were adamant that the election manual establishes a dispute resolution committee and the dispute resolution process, moreso that regulation 8 (2) of the elections manual stipulates that any dispute arising from the elections must be made in writing to the chairperson. The defendants maintained that the plaintiff did not submit to this process before approaching this Court. The defendants submitted that they were aware of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion, however, in the instant case there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify bypassing the prescribed dispute resolution mechanism. The defendants maintained that this court is divested of jurisdiction as the suit herein offends the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies. The defendants relied on the case of 
Muchiri v Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission & 3 others (Civil Case E002 of 2024
) [2024] KEHC 9980 (KLR) (30 July 2024) (Ruling) where Mwongo J. when faced with a similar matter held as follows;  “ I think I have said enough on the issue of jurisdiction and the doctrine of exhaustion. In light of all the foregoing, I find and hold that the applicant failed to utilise the Dispute Resolution Mechanism at the first instance. Accordingly, he is not entitled to litigate the dispute here, that ought to have been determined in the Dispute Resolution Committee under the Election’s Manual. In short, this court is not the correct forum with first instance jurisdiction to deal with the applicant’s dispute.”






18.
The defendants argued that it is evident from the pleadings submitted by the plaintiff that he instituted this suit in a representative capacity albeit without an authority to sue or an indication of the class of persons he seeks to represent. The defendants pointed out that the instant suit is purely a civil suit as opposed to a constitutional petition where the locus to sue is greatly expanded. The defendant cited the case of Savala & another v Ndanyi (Environment and Land Case Civil Suit 248 of 2021) [20 22] KEELC 2536 (KLR) (5 July 2022) (Ruling) where the court citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in Chalicha Farmers Co-operative Society Limited v George Odhiambo & 9 others , among others, held: “From the foregoing, it is quite clear that a party in a proceeding cannot purport to appear, plead and act on behalf of others until and unless he is so authorised to do so in writing and the authority is filed in such a proceeding. To my mind therefore, a statement in an affidavit that one has the authority of the co-plaintiffs or co-defendants is not enough. Such an authority, properly signed by the party giving the authority, must be filed in the proceeding”. The defendants reiterated that the suit herein is incompetent for want of capacity on the plaintiff’s part noting that he was neither a contestant in the said election nor has he submitted any form of authority to sue or otherwise bring this claim on a representative capacity.






19.
The defendants contended that the plaintiff suit seeks the nullification of the KTDA small holder directors’ elections held on 28
th
 June, 2023 on account of the following alleged irregularities and malpractices and cited the case of  John Kiarie Waweru v Beth Wambui Mugo& 2 Others (2008) eKLR where the Honourable Court stated as follows regarding the standard of proof in election matters; “As regards the standard of proof which ought to be discharged by the petitioner in establishing allegations of electoral malpractices, there is consensus by electoral courts that generally, the standard of proof in electoral petition cases is higher than that applicable in ordinary civil cases… The standard is higher than proof on a balance of probabilities but lower than the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt… Allegations of electoral malpractices like for instance bribery require higher proof.” The defendants submitted that the case herein is one riddled with mere allegations which the plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to support it.






20.
The defendants contended that it is not disputed that the elections in fact started at 1500 HRS and not at 0700 HRS as earlier scheduled. The defendants reiterated that they preferred a logical explanation that this delay was occasioned by the “Gen-Z protests” which severely impacted on the printing and distribution of election materials. The defendants urged this Court to take judicial notice of the fact that the country was embroiled in a political turmoil courtesy of the said protests which is a matter of general notoriety. The defendants further urged this Court to take into consideration the fact that this inconvenience was not particular and specific to Chemamul Zone, the electoral unit in the instant case but that it affected almost all similar elections across the country.






21.
The defendants urged this Honourable Court to consider the fact that the elections in fact witnessed a significant turnout of 67% of registered farmers, indicating a broadly participatory process. The defendants reiterated that in view of the great voter turnout and the lack of substantial evidence showing the alleged irregularities and malpractice and how they affected the validity of the elections, the defendants therefore urged this Court to make a finding that the plaintiff’s claims do not warrant the reliefs sought.






22.
The defendants urged this court to take cognizance of the fact that the elections were being conducted within strict timelines earlier ordered by the court sitting in Nairobi in Constitutional Petiti
on no. E254 of 2020
 where it was specifically directed that smallholder tea factories ought to conduct their directors’ election by the end of June, 2024.






23.
The defendants contended that all the contestants were satisfied with the results as is evident from the election declaration forms which were all duly signed by the contestants’ respective agents. The defendants urged this court to uphold the resounding will of Chemamul Zone Tea Growers by dismissing the plaintiff’s allegations which were unsubstantiated.






24.
This court has considered the pleadings, affidavit evidence and submissions by the parties and the sole issue for determination is whether this court is seized with jurisdiction to hear and determine this suit, in view of the doctrine of exhaustion.






25.
The plaintiff conceded that he was aware that where there is a clear dispute resolution mechanism, the same should be followed and cited the case of Kimani Wanyoike v Electoral Commission & another [1995] eKLR where the court held as follows; “where there is a clear procedure for the redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed.” However, the plaintiff contended that in the impugned 2024 elections, the dispute resolution mechanism was not cohesive, he was unaware of the members constituting the dispute resolution committee and the location of the office of the said members. The plaintiff therefore argued that the instant suit is properly before this Court.






26.
The Defendants contended that the Elections Manual clearly provided for the membership of the Disputes Resolution Committee and gave an elaborate procedure and clear timelines for purposes of lodging, hearing and determination of disputes which the Plaintiff disregarded. The Defendants submitted that they were aware of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion, however, in the instant case there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify bypassing the prescribed dispute resolution mechanism. The defendants maintained that this court is divested of jurisdiction as the suit herein offends the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies. The plaintiff has not demonstrated any efforts to invoke the internal dispute resolution mechanisms.






27.
This court therefore finds that it does not have jurisdiction to entertain the instant suit, firstly, because it is a commercial dispute between the shareholders and their company and the election of the 3rd Defendants directors is an internal affair of the company and this court cannot adjudicate on the matter. In the case of Paul Mogaka Magoma v Gianchore Tea Factory Co & 2 others [2016] eKLR  the court held that companies, be they private or public, are governed by the provisions of the 
Companies Act
 and the election of directors are internal affairs of companies that are usually regulated by the rules embedded in the articles and memorandum of association. Secondly, this court lacks jurisdiction because the plaintiff has not exhausted the internal dispute resolution mechanism provided in the Elections Procedure Manual 2024 before approaching the court. The Court of Appeal stated in Nakuru Civil Appeal No. 119 of 2017 Public Service Commission & 2 Others vs. Eric Cheruiyot & 16 Others consolidated with Civil Appeal No. 139 of 2017 County Government of Embu & Another vs. Eric Cheruiyot & 15 Others (unreported) in a decision rendered on 8th February, 2022 on the doctrine of jurisdiction in general as follows: -  “Jurisdiction is everything, it is what gives a court or a tribunal the power, authority and legitimacy to entertain a matter before it. John Beecroft Saunders in “Words and Phrases Legally Defined”, Volume 3 at Page 113 defines court jurisdiction as follows: By jurisdiction is meant the authority which a court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of the matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by the statute, charter, or commission under which the court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by the like means. If no restriction or limit is imposed the jurisdiction is said to be unlimited. A limitation may be either as to the kind and nature of the actions and matters of which the particular court has cognizance, or as to the area over which the jurisdiction shall extend, or it may partake of both these characteristics. If the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunal (including an arbitrator) depends on the existence of a particular state of facts, the court or tribunal must inquire into the existence of the facts in order to decide whether it has jurisdiction; but, except where the court or tribunal has been given power to determine conclusively whether the facts exist. Where a court takes it upon itself to exercise a jurisdiction which it does not possess, its decision amounts to nothing. Jurisdiction must be acquired before judgement is given.”






28.
There exists an election dispute mechanism in the 3rd Defendant’s Election Rules which the plaintiff ought to have exhausted before coming to this court and for that reason this court cannot grant the prayers sought. Even assuming that the suit is properly before this court, I am not convinced that the Plaintiff proved his case to the required standards. Having considered the evidence, it is that the Elections held on 29
th
 June, 2024 were free and fair. The irregularities pointed out would not have affected the validity of those Elections.
In the end, this suit is found to be without merit. It is dismissed with costs being borne by the Plaintiff.

 October 2023. In support of the application the Applicant avers that it filed 2 suits being Garissa ELC 1 & 2 of 2023 relating to 2 adjoining and overlapping parcels of land where Soko Mjinga Market within Wajir Town is located. The Applicant stated that this Court on 28
th
 July 2023 made an order transferring Garissa ELC No. 2 of 2023 – County Government of Wajir –vs- Telkom Kenya Ltd & Another to Wajir SPM’s Court for hearing and determination following an application by the Applicant seeking the transfer of the same on the basis that the Lower Court possessed the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to handle the matter. The Applicant asserted that the value of the 2 adjoining plots fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Wajir SPM’s Court. The Applicant further asserted it would be fair and in the best interest of Justice to have the two suits heard together by the same Court as the plots in question were adjoining and overlapping.






3.
The Respondent opposed the application for transfer vide a Replying Affidavit sworn by the Respondent on 30
th
 November 2023. The Respondent deponed that he was the bonafide registered proprietor of L.R No. 13607/249 Wajir Township for a leasehold term of 99 years from 1.5.1994. The Respondent further averred that the suit property LR No. 13607/249 was different from the suit property in ELC No. 2 of 2023 that was transferred to Wajir SPM’s Court and that at any rate the Respondent was neither a party in ELC No. 2 of 2023 and neither was he heard in the application that resulted in the transfer of the suit to the SPM’s Court Wajir.






4.
The Respondent contended that the Court’s power to order transfer of a suit was discretionary and a basis had to be laid to warrant the exercise of such discretion and the Applicant had not laid any such basis. The Respondent further averred that though the Applicant had based the application for transfer on the fact that the Lower Court possessed the pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the matter, there was no demonstration of the value of the suit property.






5.
The Respondent further stated that the ownership of the suit property was determined in a suit before the PM’s Court Wajir ELC No. 003 of 2022 – Bulle Ahmed Maalim –vs- Hassan Farah & 13 Others where the Applicant had unsuccessfully sought to be joined as a party and that the Applicant was not acting in good faith in seeking to have the suit transferred to the same Court. The Respondent averred that the Applicant had not demonstrated they would suffer any prejudice if the matter is not transferred.






6.
The parties canvassed the application by way of written submissions. The Plaintiff/Applicants submissions dated 15
th
 April 2024 on record relate to the Applicants Notice of Motion application dated 10
th
 March 2023 seeking injunctive orders against the Defendant/Respondent. The Plaintiff/Applicant apparently did not file any submissions in regard to the application for the transfer of the suit dated 23
rd
 October 2023. The Respondent for his part, filed his submissions dated 19
th
 May 2024 only in respect of the application for transfer of the suit and not in respect of the application for injunctive relief.






7.
The application for the transfer of the suit to the Wajir SPM’s Court is clearly wrongly premised under Section 80 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules and Order 51 Rule (1). Section 80 
Civil Procedure Act
 and Order 45 of the Civil Procedure Rules deal with review of Judgment, decrees or orders and not transfer of suits which are dealt with under Section 18 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 which provides as follows:-
(1)
On the application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing such of them as desire to be heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the High Court may at any stage—
(a)
transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or
(b)
transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or withdraw any suit or other proceeding pending in any court subordinate to it, and thereafter—
(i)
try or dispose of the same; or
(ii)
transfer the same for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or
(iii)
retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the court from which it was withdrawn.
(2)
Where any suit or proceeding has been transferred or withdrawn as aforesaid, the court which thereafter tries such suit may, subject to any special directions in the case of an order of transfer, either retry it or proceed from the point at which it was transferred or withdrawn.






8.
Only a suit instituted before a competent Court and with jurisdiction can be transferred to another Court. See the Case of Equity Bank Ltd –vs- Brian Mutie Mutuku T/A Diani Tour Travel (2016) eKLR and Abraham Mwangi Wamigwi –vs- Simon Mbiriri Wanjiku & Another (2012) eKLR.






9.
In the instant suit I understand the Plaintiff/Applicant to be seeking a transfer of the suit, firstly because they aver the SPM’s Court Wajir has the pecuniary jurisdiction; and secondly because a somewhat related case (ELC No. 2 of 2023 Garissa) where the Defendant/Respondent is not a party was transferred; and thirdly the two parcels of land in the two suits are adjoining and overlap and are situate at what is described as Soko Mjinga Market, Wajir Town. No evidence of the value of the plots has been exhibited by any party and hence the value of the plots cannot be ascertained. The Defendant/Respondent holds a registered title to a distinct parcel of land, and is not a party to ELC No. 2 of 2023 Garissa transferred to Wajir SPM’s Court and was not heard in the application that yielded the transfer of the suit. Whether or not the parcels of land overlap will be a matter of evidence to be adduced at the trial.






10.
The application before the Court is not one for the consolidation of the suits but transfer. The considerations in an application for consolidation are different from those for a transfer of a suit. It is noteworthy that infact the Plaintiff/Applicant filed the two suits on the same date (15.3.2023) at the ELC Garissa and in doing so, must have considered that the suits were distinct and separate and capable of being heard separately. The ELC has both original and appellate jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that any ELC Magistrate’s Court matter that a Magistrates Court can handle can be handled by the Environment and Land Court. Before a transfer of a suit from one Court to another, the Applicant must satisfy the reasons for doing so to forestall abuse of the process and to curtail what would amount to forum shopping.






11.
In the instant, matter I am not satisfied any credible basis has been furnished to warrant an order of transfer of the suit from this Court to the Wajir SPM’s Court. The Plaintiff’s/Applicant’s Notice of Motion application dated 23
rd
 October 2023 lacks merit and is ordered dismissed.






12.
As relates to the Plaintiff/Applicant’s Notice of Motion application dated 10
th
 March 2023 for injunctive relief, I note that the ownership of land parcel LR No. 13607/249 registered in the name of the Defendant/Respondent is contested. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendant was fraudulently registered and issued title and prays for the cancellation/revocation of the title and issue of a permanent injunction.






13.
I take cognisance that the issue of ownership can only be determined after hearing evidence at the trial. It is in the premises necessary to preserve the subject matter of the suit and in the circumstances the orders that commend themselves to the Court and which I hereby make are as follows:-
i.
That the parties shall observe and maintain the prevailing status quo as relates to the suit property pending the hearing and determination of the suit.
ii.
No party shall sell, subdivide, transfer or charge the suit property pending the hearing and determination of the suit.
iii.
The parties shall comply with Order 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules within the next 45 days from the date of this ruling.
iv.
Each party to file and serve a paginated triable bundle comprising the pleadings, all documents and witness statements within the period as in (iii) above.
v.
Mention on 27/11/2024 to confirm compliance and for pretrial directions.
vi.
The costs of the application shall be in the cause.

Moses Wanjala Wanyonyi


 


Appellant




and




Republic


 


Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal against the original conviction and sentence delivered by Hon. D. Kuto (PM) on 5th May 2022, at Kibera's Chief Magistrate Court, Criminal Case No. 464 of 2018 Republic v Moses Wanjala Wanyonyi & Cedric Shikoli Bulinda)
        
      






Judgment










1.
Moses Wanjala Wanyonyi, the appellant herein, jointly with another not before this court was charged and after a full trial, was convicted for the offence of tampering with a telecommunication plant contrary to Section 32(c) of the Information and Communication Act, Chapter 411(A) of the Laws of Kenya. He was sentenced to ten (10) years imprisonment.






2.
Being aggrieved, he filed an appeal, challenging his conviction and sentence. In his appeal, he challenged the totality of the prosecution's evidence against which he was convicted. He argued, that the prosecution's evidence was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, the trial court failed to consider the time spent in remand custody during sentencing. He urged the court to quash his conviction and set aside the sentence imposed.






3.
This is the first appellate court. As expected, I have re-analysed and re-evaluated afresh all the evidence adduced before the lower court. I have drawn my own conclusions while considering that I neither saw nor heard any of the witnesses. I will be guided by the celebrated case of Okeno Vs. Republic [1972] EA 32. where the Court of Appeal set out the duties of a first appellate court.






4.
The 
Kenya Information and Communications Act
, cap 411A, laws of Kenya. Section 32 (c) of the Act reads as follows:
A person who willfully, with intent to—
(a)
....
(b)
...
(c)
unlawfully intercept or acquaint himself or herself with the contents of any message; vandalizes, damages, removes, tampers with, touches or in any other way whatsoever interferes with any telecommunication apparatus or telecommunication line, post, or anything whatsoever, being part of or used in or about any licensed telecommunication system, commits an offence and shall be liable, on conviction to a fine of not less than five million shillings or to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years or to both.






5.
On 31st March 2018, Hillary Kiptum Rono (PW1), monitoring Telkom property at Jamhuri Estate, was alerted by a passerby about individuals cutting cables. He quickly changed into civilian clothes, called for reinforcements, and proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, he discovered two suspects in a hole arranging cut cables. Reinforcements arrived, leading to their arrest, and the recovery of cut cables, overalls, and tools including a spade, mattock, helmets, and hacksaws. He identified the appellant as one of the suspects arrested while cutting the said cables.






6.
Laban Malonza (PW2) was part of the reinforcement team that arrived. When they confronted the suspects, they claimed to be Safaricom employees. However, they lacked any identification documents. The team confiscated 91 bags of copper wire and other equipment. Juma Ishmael Maruti (PW3) confirmed the arrests, stating that the appellant and another were caught with bags of cables. He also identified the appellant in court. CPL Florence Thuranira (PW4) later interviewed the suspects at Kilimani Police Station, where they admitted their actions but lacked necessary permits, leading to the production of the seized items as evidence.






7.
The evidence of PW1, PW2, and PW3 is that the appellant was arrested while committing the offence. I do not find the evidence of the three prosecution witnesses contradictory in any way. It placed the appellant at the scene of the offence and was armed with the tools for the commission of the offence.






8.
In his defence, the appellant contended that on the day of his arrest, he was on Ngong Road heading to work at Yaya when he was put in a vehicle and taken to Kilimani police station. He alleged that he only heard of the charge when he appeared in court. He maintained his innocence.






9.
The prosecution evidence on record was overwhelming against the appellant. He was found in the act. His defence was dismissed, and rightly so, after consideration by the learned trial magistrate. His defence was an afterthought.I hold that the prosecution proved its case to the required standard of proof on the charge of tampering with a telecommunication plant beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction of the trial court is therefore affirmed.






10.
On sentence, the appellant was sentenced to serve ten (10) years imprisonment. The appellant was sentenced to serve 10 years imprisonment. It has been argued that this was harsh and excessive. In addition, the trial court failed to consider the time spent in remand custody. Section 32(c) of the 
Kenya Information and Communications Act
 provides that upon conviction to a fine of not less than five million shillings or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years or to both.






11.
The Court of Appeal in 
Dismas Wafula Kilwake vs. Republic [2019] eKLR Criminal Appeal No. 129 of 2014
 was emphatic that minimum mandatory sentences violate the right of an accused to a fair trial in so far as such sentences take away the discretion of the court in considering the mitigation of the accused. Considering the circumstances of this case in totality, I find that even though the sentence passed by the trial court was legal, excessive punishment does not serve the interests of justice, and there are exceptional instances where the trial court can depart from the prescribed minimum sentence. It is my finding that punishment imposed was excessive and ought to be set aside. I am guided by the decision in Wagude v R (1983) KLR 569 where Kneller, Hancox JJA. & Chesoni, Ag. JA. held that:
“
The Court may interfere with the sentence only if it is shown that it was manifestly excessive….""






12.
In the circumstances, it is my view that the sentence of ten (10) years imprisonment meted out though legal was harsh and excessive. I hereby exercise my discretion and substitute the sentence of ten (10) years with a sentence of five (5) years imprisonment. The sentence shall be computed less by nine (9) months and eighteen (18) days spent in remand custody pursuant to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Orders accordingly.

Judgment










Introduction


1.
The appellant was sued by the respondent vide a plaint dated 5.3.2021in which the respondent prayed for general and special damages as a result of injuries sustained following a road traffic accident.






2.
The respondent averred that on the 24
th
 February 2021 as he was lawfully riding a motorcycle registration number KMEX 308T along Kisumu – Nairobi road, at around Nyamasaria, the appellant’s motor vehicle registration number KCN 854L was so negligently, carelessly and recklessly driven, managed and/or controlled as to enter the highway from the feeder road and violently hit the respondent’s motorcycle.






3.
The parties entered into a consent on liability at 75:25% in favour of the respondent on the 6th April 2023. The trial court proceeded to award the respondent Kshs. 460,000 as general damages.






4.
Aggrieved by the trial court’s judgement on quantum, the appellant filed his appeal dated 19
th
 October 2023 in which he raised the following grounds of appeal:
a.
The learned trial magistrate grossly misdirected himself in treating the evidence and submissions on a quantum before him superficially and consequently coming to a wrong conclusion on the same.
b.
The learned trial magistrate misdirected himself in ignoring the principles applicable in awarding quantum of damage and the relevant authorities on quantum cited in the written submissions presented and filed by the appellant.
c.
The learned trial magistrate proceeded on wrong principles when assessing the damages to be awarded to the respondent (if any) and failed to apply precedents and tenets of law applicable.
d.
The learned trial magistrate erred in awarding a sum in respect of damages wwhich was so inordinately high in the circumstances that it represented an entirely erroneous estimate vis a vis the respondent’s claim.
e.
The learned trial magistrate failed to apply himself judicially and to adequately evaluate the evidence and exhibits tendered on quantum and thereby arrived at a decision unsustainable in law.






5.
The appeal was canvassed by way of written submissions.








The Appellant’s Submissions


6.
The appellant submitted that award of general damages was inordinately high considering the injuries sustained by the respondent which were soft tissue injuries and thus the award amounts to an erroneous estimate, abuse of discretionary power of the trial court and a miscarriage of justice as against him.






7.
It was submitted that an award of Kshs. 120,000 in general damages would be sufficient in the case. Reliance was placed on the cases presented before the trial court as well as the cases of:
a.
Daniel Gatana Ndungu & Another v Harrison Angore Katana [2020] eKLR where the respondent sustained a cut wound on the head, blunt injury to the right knee, multiple bruises on the right knee and the appellate court set aside the finding by the subordinate court that awarded Kshs. 350,000 on general damages and substituted it with an award of Kshs. 140,000.
b.
Justine Nyamweya Ochoki & Another v Jumaa Karisa Kipingwa [2020] eKLR where the respondent suffered a blunt object injury to the lower lip, blunt object injury to the chest and blunt object injury to the left wrist and was awarded Kshs. 300,000 that was reduced to Kshs. 150,000 on appeal.
c.
John Wambua v Mathew Makau Mwololo & Another [2020] eKLR where the plaintiff sustained blunt injury to the right shoulder and a blunt injury to the right big toe and the trial court awarded Kshs. 120,000 that was affirmed at appeal.






8.
The appellant submitted that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the award by the trial court be set aside.








The Respondent’s Submissions


9.
The respondent submitted that he suffered multiple soft tissue injuries with present complains of pain on the affected body parts as well as painful psychological trauma, with extensive post injuries scar. The respondent relied on the cases placed before the trial court as well as the following cases:






10.
Vincent Cheruiyot Rono v Mombasa Maize Millers Ltd [2006] eKLR in which the Plaintiff was awarded Ksh. 400,000 for a deep cut on the face, multiple pain on both legs, arms and shoulders, abrasion on the lower chin, back ache and chest pain.






11.
Catherine Wanjiru Kingori & 3 others v Gibson Theuri Gichubi [2005] eKLR was awarded Kshs. 100,000.00 where she suffered injury on the back. In the same case the 3rd Plaintiff who suffered multiple soft tissue injuries, injury on the left elbow joint, and injuries on both ankles was awarded Kshs 350,000.00.






12.
Charles Gichuki v Emily Kawira Mbuba & another [2018]] eKLR, the respondent suffered a blunt injury (tender) on the right side of the face, a blunt injury (tender) on the shoulders, a blunt injury (tender) on the chest and a blunt injury (tender) to the left thigh. Sergon J. substituted the trial court’s award of Kshs 400,000/= with Kshs 300,000/=






13.
It was submitted that the appellant had not shown how the trial magistrate acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that the amount awarded was so extremely high in the judgment of the Court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage to which the Respondent was entitled as was held by the Court of Appeal in the case of Mohamed Mahmoud Jabane v Highstone Butty Tongoi Olenja [1986] eKLR.






14.
The respondent submitted that the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs to him.








Analysis and Determination


15.
This being a first appeal, this court is under a duty to re-evaluate and re assess the evidence and make its own conclusions. It must, however, bear in mind that a trial court, unlike the appellate court, had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and hearing their evidence first hand. In Abok James Odera T/A A.J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira T/A Machira & Co. Advocates [2013] eKLR, the court stated as follows:
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and reanalyze the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial Judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






16.
In that regard, an appellate court will only interfere with the judgment of the lower court, if the said decision is founded on wrong legal principles. That was the holding of the Court of Appeal in Mkube v Nyamuro [1983] LLR at 403, where Kneller JA & Hancox Ag JJA held that-
“
A Court on appeal will not normally interfere with the finding of fact by a trial court unless it is based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or the judge is shown demonstrably to have acted on wrong principles in reaching his conclusion.”






17.
In Kemfro Africa Limited T/A Meru Express Services & Gathongo Kanini v A.M. Lubia & Olive Lubia (1982-88) I KAR 727 at page 730, Kneller J.A. stated:
“
The principles to be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the quantum of damages awarded by a trial judge were held by the former Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa to be that it must be satisfied that either the judge, in assessing the damages took into account an irrelevant factor, or left out of account a relevant one or that; short of this, the amount is so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. See Ilango V Manyoka [1967] E.A. 705, 709, 713; Lukenya Ranching and Farming Cooperative Society Limited Vs Kalovoto [1970] E.A. 414, 418, 419. This court follows the same principles.”






18.
The principles espoused in the above Court of Appeal decision have stood the test of time and continue to be applied by all appellate courts.






19.
In the case of P. J. Dave Flowers Ltd v David Simiyu Wamalwa Civil Appeal No. 6 of 2017 [2018] eKLR rendered itself on the matter of assessment of quantum as below:
“
… it is generally accepted from the laid down legal principles on assessment of quantum that personal injuries are difficult to assess with precision and accuracy so as to satisfy the claimant. The courts discretion has been left to individual judges to exercise judicious in respect of the circumstances of each specific case. The sum total of the evidence and the medical reports positive findings will form part of the consideration in the award of damages. The trial court will also be expected to apply the principles in various case law and authorities decided by the superior courts on the matter.”






20.
I have considered the evidence adduced in the trial court on the injuries sustained by the respondent and the submissions for and against this appeal. I find issue sole issue for determination to be whether the trial court made an award that was too high as contended by the Appellant.






21.
General damages are damages at large whose purpose is to compensate the injured to the extent that such injury can be assuaged by a money award. It has been stated that money cannot renew a physical frame that has been injured and crushed hence the courts can only award sums which must be viewed as giving reasonable compensation. Awards ought to be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation bearing in mind that the large and inordinate awards may injure the body politic. Furthermore, it is desirable that so far as possible comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards putting into consideration the current prevailing economic circumstances including inflation (see Tayab v Kinanu [1983] KLR 114 and West (H) & Son Ltd v Shephard [1964] AC 326, 345).






22.
It is not in dispute that the respondent was injured, hence the question is, what was the nature and extent of the injuries and what award should they should attract. In his statement of claim filed on the 5
th
 March 2021, the respondent pleaded that he sustained the following injuries:
i.
Swollen right fore head with deep cut wound with active bleeding
ii.
Swollen right orbital margins upper and lower
iii.
Reddish right eye
iv.
Swollen left orbital margin and tender
v.
Swollen upper lips with cut wounds and tender
vi.
Tender chest wall
vii.
Bruised right hand and tender
viii.
Swollen right knee joint with multiple bruises and tender






23.
The respondent further complained that at the time of going to court, he was suffering pain on the affected body parts as well as psychological trauma with extensive post injuries scar.






24.
The said injuries were confirmed in the P3 form and treatment note attached to the respondent’s plaint. The treatment notes from St. Georges Medical Centre produced by the respondent stated that the respondent had sustained deep cut wounds and multiple soft tissue injury. No medical expert was called by either of the parties to testify on the said injuries. However, the medical report produced as an exhibit by the respondent filled by one Dr. S.R. Patel concluded that the respondent had sustained “soft tissue injuries with scarring of forehead cut wound of harm in nature.” I note that the P3 form produced by the appellant described the degree of injury sustained by the respondent as harm.






25.
Taking all the above into consideration it is my opinion that the nature of injuries sustained by the respondent were soft tissue.






26.
I have considered the authorities relied on by both parties and it is my view that those relied on by the respondent related to more serious injuries while those by the appellant were more comparable.






27.
The appellant submitted that the trial court’s award of Kshs. 460,000 was excessive, inordinately high and erroneous. The appellant urged this Court to set aside the award of the trial magistrate and award Kshs. 120,000 in general damages for soft tissue injuries.






28.
I have considered comparative awards in other cases where general damages for soft tissue injuries were made. In 
Maimuna Kilungwa vs Motrex Transporters Ltd [2019] eKLR Makueni Civil Appeal No. 11 of 2017
, the court awarded Kshs. 125,000/= for injuries to the neck, left ear and left shoulder.






29.
In the case of Ephraim Wagura Muthui & 2 others V Toyota Kenya Limited & 2 others [2019] eKLR Majanja J set aside the lower court award of Kshs. 55,000 for cut wound on the parietal area of the head, contusion on the neck, blunt trauma to the chest, cut wound on the left leg and blunt trauma to the back, injuries that were soft tissue in nature, and substituted it with an award of Kshs. 100,000.






30.
In Nyambati Nyaswabu Erick v Toyota Kenya Limited & 2 Others (2019) eKLR where Majanja J set aside the lower court`s award of Kshs. 55,000/= for a deep cut on the scalp extending to the maxillary area, blunt injury to the left side of the chest, contusion on the back and contusion on both legs and substituted with an award of Kshs. 90,000/-.






31.
Considering that the respondent had sustained a deep cut wound on the head as well as other soft tissue injuries, I am of the view that a sum of Kshs. 180,000/= is sufficient compensation for the injuries sustained. In the premises the award of the trial court is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 180,000/=. less 25% contribution leaving a balance of Kshs Kshs 135,000 plus costs and interest at court rates on general damages from the date of judgment in the lower court until payment in full.






32.
On costs of this appeal, as the award made has been significantly reduced, I order that each party bear their own costs of this appeal.

Respondent







        
          (Being an appeal from the ruling of Hon.F.M Nyakundi, Senior, Resident Magistrate delivered on 12th June, 2024 in regard to the rectified certificate of grant dated 21st September, 2023)
        
      






Ruling










1.
The application coming up for determination is a notice of motion dated 18th June, 2024 seeking the following orders;
(i)
Spent
(ii)
That this honourable court be pleased to issue conservatory orders as far as dealing or transacting with the subject property in Re Estate of the Late Chumo Maina alia Chumo A. Maina; Succession Cause No. 188 of 2019; Eda Chepngeno Cheres v Raeli Marusoi by the respondent in any way pending the hearing and determination and the appeal.
(iii)
That as a result there be stay of execution and implementation of the rectified grant dated 21st September, 2023 pending hearing and determination of this application and the appeal.
(iv)
That the respondent do bear the cost of this application.






2.
The application is supported by grounds on the face of it and the supporting affidavit of Eda Chepngeno Cheres the applicant herein.






3.
The applicant avers that she filed Succession Cause No. 188 of 2019 in regard to the estate of her deceased father-in-law the Late Chumo Maina alia Chumo A. Maina.






4.
The applicant avers that she was issued with a certificate of confirmation of grant on 21st December, 2021 and was intent on distributing shares to the beneficiaries based on the mode of distribution preferred by clan members.






5.
The applicant avers that soon thereafter the respondent filed summons for revocation of grant, upon hearing and determination of the application for revocation of the court directed that the applicant and respondent be joint petitioners as opposed to revocation of the grant and that parties agree on the mode of distribution of the estate.






6.
The applicant avers that the court ordered that the grant that was issued to her be rectified upon being misled by the respondent who is the 2nd petitioner in the lower court that the parties had agreed on the mode of distribution by attaching a forged consent.






7.
The applicant avers that being dissatisfied with the rectified grant, she instructed her lawyers to appeal the decision, however the statutory timelines for appeal had lapsed, therefore the lawyer filed a Misc Civil Applicati
on No. 10 of 2023
 in the High Court seeking for extension of time to appeal.






8.
The applicant avers that the rectified grant was set aside on 13th February, 2024 and parties directed to agree on the mode of distribution, however, the parties failed to agree on a preferred mode of distribution.






9.
The applicant avers that she is aggrieved by the fact that on 12th June, 2024 the court delivered a ruling reinstating the rectified grant dated 21st September, 2023, hence necessitating the instant appeal.






10.
The applicant avers that she fears if the orders sought are not granted, the respondent will execute the rectified grant and the applicant condemned unheard.






11.
The applicant avers that the beneficiaries did not consent to the mode of distribution that resulted in the rectification of the grant.






12.
The applicant avers that in the rectified grant there are strangers who were included as beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased.






13.
The applicant avers that they have not agreed on 0.5 acres that they stated ought to cover legal expenses as she had incurred more expenses than any other beneficiary given the fact that she filed the succession cause.






14.
The applicant avers that it is only fair and in the interest of justice that there be a stay of execution of the implementation of the rectified grant until the appeal has been heard and determined.






15.
The respondent filed a replying affidavit in response to the application for stay of execution of the rectified grant pending appeal which was sworn by Raeli Marusoi the respondent, who vehemently opposes the application.






16.
The respondent avers that the instant application is time barred and that no time extension was sought and granted.






17.
The respondent avers that the applicant has not provided security which is a condition for stay and further that she has not demonstrated prejudice based on the rectified certificate of confirmation of grant, the respondent avers that the mode of distribution as espoused in the rectified grant is fair.






18.
The respondent avers that the appellant filed the main succession cause secretly, prosecuted the same until it was confirmed and when the other beneficiaries discovered, they sought for the revocation of the grant.






19.
The respondent avers that seeking stay of the enforcement of the rectified certificate of grant is prejudicial to the other beneficiaries.






20.
The respondent avers that during confirmation of summons which she filed, the appellant was present she never opposed or filed any protest.






21.
The respondent avers legal fees was based on a retainer and therefore do not concern or affect the appellant’s beneficial share of the estate.






22.
The respondent faulted the appellant for having deliberately lied by concealing filing of the main cause and stifling the enforcement of the rectified certificate of grant to perpetuate acts of fraud on the subject parcel of land, which she had registered in her name absolutely prior to revocation of grant.






23.
I have considered the pleadings by both parties and the main issue for determination is whether to grant a stay of the enforcement of the rectified certificate pending hearing and determination of the appeal.






24.
Generally, a stay of execution should only be granted where sufficient cause is shown. In Antoine Ndiaye v African Virtual University (2015)eKLR Gikonyo J opined that “…stay of execution should only be granted where sufficient cause has been shown by the applicant. And in determining whether sufficient cause has been shown, the court should be guided by the three prerequisites provided under order 42 rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules…” The principles guiding the grant of a stay of execution pending appeal are well settled under Order 42 rule 6 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides: “No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
(b)
such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.”






25.
It is the duty of the applicant in an application for stay of execution to establish that he/she will suffer substantial loss if the orders sought are not granted. In Machira t/a Machira & Co. Advocates v East African Standard (No 2) (2002) KLR 63 the Court of Appeal considered as to what amounts to substantial loss and held that – “No doubt, in law, the fact that the process of execution has been put in motion, or is likely to be put in motion, by itself, does not amount to substantial loss. Even when execution has been levied and completed, that is to say, the attached properties have been sold, as is the case here, does not in itself amount to substantial loss under Order 42 Rule 6 of the CPR. This is so because execution is a lawful process. The applicant must establish other factors which show that the execution will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the applicant as the successful party in the appeal ...” The applicant contends that she will suffer substantial loss if the orders sought are not granted as the respondent will execute the rectified grant and the applicant condemned unheard. The respondent on the other hand contends that there is no loss to be suffered as the mode of distribution as espoused in the rectified grant is fair. This Court finds that the applicant has not demonstrated that she will suffer any loss, leave alone substantial loss, if the orders sought are not granted.






26.
As to whether the instant application was filed without unreasonable delay. This court has considered that the ruling subject of this suit was delivered on 12th June, 2024 whereas the application for stay was filed on 18th June, 2024. This court finds that the application for stay was filed timeously.






27.
The other consideration for an application of stay pending appeal is security. This court has noted that the applicant in this matter has not offered any security. In Focin Motorcycle Co. Limited v Ann Wambui Wangui & another [2018] eKLR the court observed as follows; “Where the applicant proposes to provide security as the applicant has done, it is a mark of good faith that the application for stay is not just meant to deny the respondent the fruits of judgement. My view is that it is sufficient for the applicant to state that he is ready to provide security or to propose the kind of security but it is the discretion of the Court to determine the security.”






28.
Generally, the objective of the application of stay of execution pending appeal is to prevent substantial loss from befalling the applicant and the appeal from being rendered nugatory. Therefore the applicant must furnish this court with a lawful and reasonable reason to limit the respondent’s right to immediate realisation of the fruits of judgement in this case implementation of the rectified certificate of confirmation of grant. In the case of James Wangalwa & Another v Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR the court observed that; “The applicant must establish other factors which show that the execution will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the applicant as the successful party in the appeal.” The applicant, on her part, stated that the beneficiaries did not consent to the mode of distribution, strangers were included as beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased and that the beneficiaries did not agree on 0.5 acres that ought to cover legal expenses. The respondent on the other hand, averred that the mode of distribution of the estate is fair and non-discriminatory. That seeking for a stay of the enforcement of the rectified certificate of grant is prejudicial to the other beneficiaries and that the legal fees was based on a retainer and therefore do not concern or affect the appellant’s beneficial share of the estate. The respondents were adamant that during the confirmation of summons, the appellant was present and never opposed or filed any protest. In the circumstances, this court finds that the applicant has not demonstrated substantial loss warranting this court to issue orders staying the implementation of the rectified certificate of grant.






29.
The upshot is that there is no merit in the application. The same is thereby dismissed with no orders as to costs.

Ruling










1.
By a notice of motion application dated 6/5/2024, the respondent/applicant sought the following reliefs:-
1.
Spent
2.
Spent
3.
That the court do issue an order of stay of the execution of its order of 5
th
 October 2023 pending the hearing and determination of Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No. C0ACA/E978/2023 – Biodeal Laboratories Ltd versus – Nelson Odhiambo.
4.
Costs be in cause.






2.
The application is premised on grounds 1 to 5 set out on the face of the notice of motion and buttressed in the supporting affidavit of Nihel Shah, a Director of the respondent the butt of which is that the applicant being dissatisfied with the judgment has filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal. That the decree holder has through Nairobi Connection Services Auctioneers in execution of the decree of this court of 5/10/2023 proclaimed the judgment debtor’s goods. That the appeal has good chances of success and the applicant is ready and willing to furnish such reasonable security as the court may direct.






3.
The application is opposed vide a replying affidavit of Dr. Nelson Odhiambo, the claimant/respondent who deposes that upon delivery of judgment on 5/10/2023, bill of costs dated 13/10/2023 was lodged and a ruling is pending on the bill of costs.






4.
That the applicant meanwhile lodged a notice of appeal dated 5/10/2023 on 7/10/2023 before this court.






5.
That consequently the respondent/applicant lodged an application dated 30/10/2023 under certificate of urgency before the Court of Appeal Nairobi for stay of execution pending appeal which application is C0ACAPPL/E505/ 2023 Bio Deal Laboratories Versus – Dr. Nelson Odhiambo.






6.
The Court of Appeal on 2/11/2023 gave directions on the notice of motion by the respondent/applicant where the application was not certified urgent. However, parties were directed to file and exchange responses and submissions and both parties have since complied with the Court of Appeal’s directions by filing their respective submissions awaiting the hearing and determination of the application.






7.
The claimant/respondent herein decided to instruct auctioneers to proclaim and attach the goods of the respondent/applicant in execution of the judgment of the court, the Court of Appeal having not issued any interim orders.






8.
The respondent/applicant immediately moved the Court of Appeal through a letter dated 22/4/2023 and affidavit sworn by Mr. Nihel Shah attaching the warrant served from the auctioneers and requesting the Court of Appeal to reconsider the matter of urgency under Rule 49(5) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2022 and grant interim orders for stay pending hearing of the stay application.






9.
The Court of Appeal heard counsel for both parties orally on 30/4/2024 and delivered a ruling on 3/5/2024 where the Court of Appeal declined to certify the matter as urgent once again and held that the reasons advanced by the respondent/applicant did not have merit including the issue of threat of execution hence there were no interim stay orders granted.






10.
The applicant having failed at the Court of Appeal to secure interim orders filled this application seeking the same orders






11.
That the matter being sub judice before the Court of Appeal makes this application a blatant abuse of the court process and the applicant is guilty of non-disclosure of material facts before this court that it was unable to secure interim orders for stay of execution before the Court of Apeal. That the applicant lacks clean hands and should not come to equity. That this application be dismissed accordingly.






12.
The court has considered submissions by the parties and is satisfied that this application is an abuse of the process of this court having been filed while a similar application was pending before the Court of Appeal. The applicant also sought ex-parte interim orders that had been denied twice before the Court of Appeal.






13.
Following the authority in HCJR/E045/2020 Republic – applicant versus Paul Kihara Kariuki and 2 others and Law Society of Kenya Ex-parte applicants, the court finds that this matter is not only sub judice, but also this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the present application since a similar and identical application is pending before the Court of Appeal for determination. That the application before the Court of Appeal was filed before the present one and the Court of Appeal twice declined to grant interim orders which were granted in this application ex-parte, by a duty judge, due to non-disclosure of material facts.






14.
Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a matter which has substantially been canvassed by the Court of Appeal and is pending determination by the Court of Appeal.






15.
While observing that this application on the face of it lacks merit, the court nonetheless strikes the application out for lack of jurisdiction to entertain it while a similar matter is pending before the Court of Appeal.






16.
Accordingly, the interim orders issued by the duty judge are discharged and the application is struck out with costs to the claimant/respondent.






17.
The court has also considered the application dated 7/6/2023 urging the court to correct a mistake apparent on the face of the judgment to wit an arithmetical error in the deducting directly Kshs. 458,152 as a net amount from the decretal sum of Kshs. 1,597993 which is a gross amount awarded by the court is an error that requires rectification by the court in terms of rule 74(1) (b) of the ELRC (Procedure) Rules 2024.






18.
In terms of this rule which is expressly the same as the previous rule 33(1)(b) of ELRC (Procedure) Rules 2016, a court may correct a mistake obvious on the face of the record upon application by either party or in terms of Rule 75, correct such a mistake on its own motion and notify the parties of such rectification even where there has been no application by either of the parties.






19.
Where an application is however filed by either of the parties, it is a procedural requirement to support the application by affidavit. Failure to file a supporting affidavit is, however, not fatal provided the court is satisfied that the judgment discloses on the face of it, a clerical mistake, incidental error or omission which the court may rectify on its own motion.






20.
In the present matter, the court is not satisfied that the judgment of the court contains an error, mistake or omission or does not speak to the parties with sufficient clarity as to the decretal sum owed by the respondent /applicant to the claimant/respondent in the sum of Kshs. 1,139,841/=.






21.
Accordingly, the application for review of the judgment dated 7/6/2024 is dismissed with no order as to costs.






22.
For the avoidance of doubt the application dated 6/5/2024 is struck off with costs and one dated 7/6/2024 is dismissed with no order as to costs.

          (Being a reference from the decision of ( Ochieng, JA) dated 10th November 2023 in an application seeking to extend time to file a notice of appeal against the Judgment Environment and Land Court at Kericho in ELC No. 71 of 2018)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is a reference to the full Court, under Rule 57 of this Court’s Rules, from the decision of a single Judge (Ochieng, JA) dated 10
th
 November, 2023. The learned single Judge’s ruling was made pursuant to an application brought under Rule 4 of the Rules, for extension of time to file a notice of appeal out of time against the ruling of the judgment of the Environment and Land Court (ELC) (Oundo, J.) dated 27
th
 February, 2023.






2.
Briefly, the facts precipitating the filing of the application are that the parties entered into a sale agreement for the applicant’s property. The sale did not proceed due to lack of spousal consent and the parties entered into a mediation agreement dated 6
th
 October 2022, to wit, that the applicant would refund Kshs.5,509,272.00 already paid for the property, that the applicant would facilitate the payment process so that it is finalised within 14 days and that the court would determine the interest rates. He failed to abide by the terms of the mediation agreement and judgment was entered against him on 27
th
 February 2023, wherein the court ordered him to pay the balance within 14 days with interest of 20% on the principal sum.






3.
Aggrieved the applicant filed a notice of appeal out of time, being 2
nd
 May 2023 and filed an application seeking extension of time to file his notice of appeal. The reasons for the delay were interalia, that he had suffered a stroke and was admitted on 3
rd
 March 2023 to 28
th
 April 2023, that the learned Judge misinterpreted the mediation agreement which only required him to give information from his bankers and that he had    already refunded Kshs.3,000,000.00 and made arrangements with his bank to pay the balance.






4.
In dismissing the application, the learned judge rendered himself thus:
“
The applicant told the court that he was admitted on 3rd March, 2023. However, the discharge summary attached to the applicant’s affidavit indicates that the applicant was admitted on 30th March, 2023.
... I find no explanation as to why he misstated the date of his admission.
I also note that the applicant has not requested for typed proceedings and a certified copy of the judgment, to enable him prepare a record of appeal. He only states that he has an arguable appeal with high chances of success. The applicant has also indicated that he is making payments towards refunding the respondents. He stated that what remains in a balance of Kshs.2,509,272/- and he has made arrangements with the bank to pay the same. It is in this regard that I am unable to reconcile these actions with what the applicant would want to appeal against, since he is already in the process of honouring the judgment.
...In my considered view, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the existence of the parameters set out in Leo Sila Mutiso (supra). The delay herein has not been satisfactorily explained. Secondly, the applicant has not demonstrated that he has an arguable appeal.”






5.
The applicant in his written submissions contends that the single judge erred by failing to consider his replying affidavit dated 30
th
 May 2023 which succinctly explained the reason for his failure to comply with the 14-day timeline and also contained certified medical records that showed he was indeed unwell. He further submitted that his appeal was arguable given that the single judge and the trial Court incorrectly interpreted the mediation award and that the 14-day timeline stated was to ensure he relayed information from his bank and not to refund the outstanding balance. Lastly, he stated that the respondents were frustrating the loan repayment through his bank by refusing to release the title to the property.






6.
The respondents in their submissions maintain that the learned judge exercised his discretion correctly and emphasised that the applicant was already in the process of honouring the judgment.






7.
We have carefully considered the facts, the submissions of parties, the ruling of the learned single judge, and are of the view that the reference turns on, whether the single judge judiciously exercised his discretion. The applicant in an   application such as this, must demonstrate that the learned single Judge disregarded a relevant matter, regarded an irrelevant matter or acted on a misapprehension of evidence or applicable law. (Simeon Okingo & 4 others vs Benta Juma Nyakako [2021] eKLR).






8.
From the impugned ruling of the learned single Judge, we note that the Court appreciated the inexhaustive list of factors to be considered in an application for extension of time as stated in 
Muringa Company Ltd vs Archdiocese of Nairobi Registered Trustees, Civil Application No. 190 of 2019
.






9.
In this instance, the applicant ought to have explained the 51- day delay in filing the notice of appeal between 13
th
 March 2023 and 2
nd
 May 2023. Despite being sympathetic to the applicant’s sickness, the court noted that even though the applicant stated that he had been hospitalised on 3
rd
 March, 2023 and was unable to file the notice, the discharge summary attached to his affidavit indicated that the applicant was admitted on 30
th
 March, 2023. Consequently, no cogent explanation was given as to why the document could not be filed before 30
th
 March, 2023.






10.
In addition, the leaned judge noted that the that the applicant had failed to request for typed proceedings and a certified copy of the judgment, and that he was in the process of paying the balance of the refund in line with the judgment.






11.
It is clear to us that the applicant is not contesting the fact that he owes the judgment sum. In fact, he has admitted the whole sum and that he is in the process of paying the balance but has hit a snag with processing the loan from the bank. These considerations rightly led the learned Judge to conclude that the intended appeal had no substance and to dismiss the application on the twin principles that; there was unsatisfactory explanation by the applicant of the delay and that the appeal was not arguable.






12.
Based on the material placed before the learned Judge, we are satisfied that he did not consider any irrelevant matters or disregard any relevant matters that would have influenced his decision. We are satisfied that the learned Judge acted judiciously and find no basis to interfere with his judicial discretion. As in the case of the single judge, the applicant is a party who entered into a sale agreement with the respondent    but is unwilling or unable to settle the debt rightly due and owing. The main objective of the applicant coming to court is to delay a clear eventuality. The process he is undertaking is nothing but a delaying tactics, in order to punish the respondent, who is pursuing repayment of his money but is kept away through the court process. We think, nothing will be achieved by the pursuit of mirage by the applicant






13.
We find this reference devoid of merit and dismiss it with costs to the respondent.

Ruling










1.
A Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 4/12/2023 was taken out by the 1
st
 Respondent on the grounds that:
a.
The Data Protection Act being an Act of Parliament to give effect Article 31(c) and (d) of 
the Constitution
 to establish the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; to make provision for the regulation of the processing of personal data; to provide for the rights of data subjects and obligations of data controllers and processors and for connected purposes. 
The Constitution
 therefore provided for inbuilt resolution mechanisms within the Data Protection Act for resolution of the sort of dispute that has been presented before this Honorable Court.
b.
Section 56 of the 
Data Protection Act, 2019
 requires a data subject who is aggrieved by the decision of any person under the Act to lodge a complaint with the data commissioner. The Data Commissioner is, in turn, enjoined by the Act to investigate any complaint and make a determination within ninety days. Section 65 of the Data Protection Act actually prescribes various remedies in cases where the Data Commissioner finds that there is a violation or threat of violation of the provisions of the Act.
c.
There exists an alternative remedy in section 56 and 64 of the 
Data Protection Act, 2019
 as read with regulations 3(a) and 4 of the Data Protection (Complaints Handling Procedure And Enforcement) Regulations, 2021 available to the Petitioner. The Petitioner therefore ought to have exhausted the available mechanisms for resolution of the instant dispute before invoking the instant Court’s jurisdiction.
d.
Section 64 of the Data Protection Act provides that a person against whom any administrative action is taken by the Data Commissioner, including enforcement and notices, may appeal to this Honorable Court. This Court cannot therefore be the first port of call for the nature of the dispute. The Petitioner therefore violated the doctrine of exhaustion.
e.
The matters raised by the Petitioners fall under the jurisdiction of the Data Protection Commissioner established under sections 3(c) (d) and (e) of the 
Data Protection Act, 2019
 and this Honorable Court ought to discourage invocation of the constitutional process where there exists a parallel or alternative statutory remedy. The Honorable Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine issues raised in the Petition as the same does not raise justifiable constitutional matters.
f.
Even if the allegations raised in the Petition merit litigation, the claim is founded on tort and private law as the issues raised in the instant Petition are in the nature of grievances between private parties and should not be entertained as a Constitutional Petition.
g.
In the circumstances therefore, this Honorable Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute in the said Petition.






2.
In his submissions filed on 7/3/2024, the Petitioner relies on the Supreme Court of Kenya case of Nicholus v Attorney General & 7 others; National Environmental Complains Committee
 & 5 others (Interested Parties) (Petition E007 of 2023
) [2023] KESC 113 (KLR) (28 December 2023) (Judgment) and Wanjiru v Machakos University (Petiti
on E021 of 2021
) [ 2022] KEHC 10599 (KLR) (3 August 2022) (Judgment) in urging that the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine issues of alleged violations of 
the Constitution
, and the doctrine of exhaustion and the availability of an alternative remedy under the Data Protection Act as alleged in the Preliminary Objection do not bar him from seeking constitutional reliefs from the court.






3.
By its written submissions dated 10/4/2024, the 1
st
 Respondent urges that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance dissuades parties from filing constitutional petitions where the issues could be handled by other means. It urges that the exceptions available to the doctrine of exhaustion do not exist to the Petitioner, and cites 
Mwangi & another v Naivasha County Hotel t/a Sawela Lodges (Petition E003 of 2021
)[2022] KEHC 10975 (KLR) (19 July 2022) (Ruling) and Communications Commission of Kenya & 5 others v Royal Media Services & 5 others (2014) eKLR. It cited Nicholas Abidha (Supra), to urge that each case has to be analyzed with its unique circumstances as to whether the main issue being unauthorized use of photographs can be dealt with, without involving the constitutional process. It urges that the case of Wanjiru v Machakos University (Supra) cited by the Petitioner is inapplicable to this case. It urges that the court lacks jurisdiction to determine the dispute herein which is merely private suit camouflaged as a constitutional matter, because the Petitioner neither exhausted the alternative remedy in the resolution of the dispute nor adhered to the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.






4.
The 2
nd
 Respondent urges that the dispute resolution mechanisms for issues of violation of the rights to privacy are under the province of the Data Commissioner and thus this court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the issues raised in the petition. He urges that the exceptions available to the doctrine of exhaustion do not assist the Petitioner, and cites Geoffrey Muthinja & another v Samuel Muguna Henry & 1756 others (2015) eKLR, Cleophas Malala & another v Speaker of the Senate & 2 others; Stewart Madzayo & another (Interested Parties) [2021] eKLR and Mwangi & another v Naivasha County Hotel t/a Sawela Lodges (Supra). He urges that the mere quoting of a constitutional provision does not turn a matter into a constitutional one, and cites Commission of Kenya & 5 others v Royal Media Services Limited & 5 others (2014) eKLR and Bernard Murage v Fineserve Africa Limited & 3 Others (2015) eKLR.






Analysis and Determination


5.
Upon considering the Preliminary Objection and the written submissions together with the authorities cited therein, the singular issue for determination is whether this court is vested with the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the matter.






6.
What properly constitutes a preliminary objection has been defined times over including in the locus classicus case of Mukisa Biscuit Company v Westend Distributor Limited (1969) EA 696 as follows:-
“
A Preliminary Objection is in the nature of what used to be a demurrer. It raises a pure point of law which is argued on the assumption that all the facts pleaded by the other side are correct. It cannot be raised if any fact has to be ascertained or if what is sought is the exercise of judicial discretion.”






7.
This court in Meru Succession Cause No. 26/1988 In the Matter of the Estate of Thomas Mbui Njenge Alias Thomas Nchenge (Deceased) David Mbuko T. Mbui v Susan Gacheri VOL. 8 NO. 62 held that:
“
In the circumstances, a preliminary objection should only be raised where there are no disputations on matters of facts by parties. Although parties did not address the Court on the import and tenor of a preliminary objection, this Court finds this to be an important matter which has the potential of either granting or divesting this Court with jurisdiction to entertain the preliminary object which forms the subject of this Ruling. This Court cannot overlook the question of jurisdiction, even with respect to entertain the preliminary objection. Should this Court find that there are any disputations of fact which will require it to look at evidence adduced and interrogate factual issues, the Court will not have jurisdiction to entertain the preliminary objection.”






8.
The cause of action of the Petitioner’s grievance is the alleged violation of his rights under Articles 28 and 31 of 
the Constitution
. In his petition dated 7/3/2023, he seeks specific reliefs that:
a.
A declarationbe and is hereby issued that the Respondents violated the Petitioner’s fundamental right to privacy and human dignity under Article 28 and 31 of 
the Constitution
 by publishing and/or using the Petitioner’s image for purposes of marketing and advertisement without the petitioner’s consent.
b.
A declarationbe and is hereby issued that the Respondents are in breach of Sections 25(a), 26(a), 29(a), (b), (c) of the Data Protection 
Act, No. 24 of 2019
.
c.
An orderof permanent injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the Respondents from publishing and/or using the Petitioner’s image or likeness in in advertising/marketing their products without express consent from the Petitioner.
d.
An orderof mandamus to compel the Respondent to compensate the Petitioner general damages of Ksh.10,000,000/- arising from the usage of the petitioner’s image for commercial, marketing and advertising gains at the expense of the petitioner.
e.
Costs of this Petition and incidentals be provided for.
f.
The Honorable Court be at liberty to grant any other relief that may be just and expedient.






9.
The Petitioner is accused of prematurely rushing to this court without having first exhausted the dispute resolution mechanisms available under Section 56 of the Data Protection Act.






10.
As shown in the issues framed in the case, identified as follows:
“
a.
Whether the use and publication of the Petitioner’s image by the Respondent without consent was a violation of the Petitioner’s right to privacy and right to human dignity.

the court in 
Wanjiru v Machakos University (Petition E021 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 10599 (KLR) (3 August 2022) (Judgment) was not called to determine the issue of exhaustion doctrine and constitutional avoidance.






11.
As counseled by the Court of Appeal in the locus classicus case of Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” v Caltex Oil Kenya Ltd [1989] eKLR, jurisdiction is everything and without it, a court has no power to make one more step. Where a court has no jurisdiction, there would be no basis for a continuation of proceedings pending other evidence. A court of law must down its tools in respect of the matter before it the moment it holds the opinion that it is without jurisdiction.






12.
The Court notes that the Data Protection 
Act No. 24 of 2019
, commencing on 25/11/2019, was enacted as the primary protection of the right to privacy being “AN ACT of Parliament to give effect to Article 31(c) and (d) of 
the Constitution
; to establish the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; to make provision for the regulation of the processing of personal data; to provide for the rights of data subjects and obligations of data controllers and processors; and for connected purposes.”






13.
Article 31 of 
the Constitution
 provides for the right to privacy as follows:
“Privacy.
31.
Every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have—
(a)
their person, home or property searched;
(b)
their possessions seized;
(c)
information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed; or
(d)
the privacy of their communications infringed.”






14.
The Data Protection Act is an enforcement mechanism for the right to privacy. Section 56 of the Data Protection Act provides for complaints to the Data Commissioner as follows;
“
(1)
A data subject who is aggrieved by a decision of any person under this Act may lodge a complaint with the Data Commissioner in accordance with this Act.
(2)
A person who intends to lodge a complaint under this Act shall do so orally or in writing.
(3)
Where a complaint made under subclause (1) is made orally, the Data Commissioner shall cause the complaint to be recorded in writing and the complaint shall be dealt with in accordance with such procedures as the Data Commissioner may prescribe.
(4)
A complaint lodged under subclause (1) shall contain such particulars as the Data Commissioner may prescribe.
(5)
A complaint made to the Data Commissioner shall be investigated and concluded within ninety days.”






15.
Regulation 3 of the Data Protection (Complaints Handling Procedure and Enforcement) Regulations provides that;
“
3.
The object and purpose of these Regulations is to— (a) facilitate a fair, impartial, just, expeditious, proportionate and affordable determination of complaints lodged with the Data Commissioner in accordance with the Act and these Regulations, without undue regard to technicalities of procedure; (b) provide for issuance of enforcement notices as contemplated under section 58 of the Act; (c) provide for issuance of penalty notices as contemplated under section 62 of the Act; (d) provide for the procedure for hearing and determining of complaints; and (e) provide for the resolution of complaints lodged with the Data Commissioner by means of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms as speci?ed under section 9(1)(c) of the Act.”






16.
Regulation 4 of those Regulations provides for lodging of a complaint as follows;
“
(1)
Pursuant to section 56 of the Act, a data subject or any person aggrieved on any matter under the Act may lodge a complaint with the Data Commissioner. (2) A complaint lodged under subregulation (1) may be lodged in Form DPC 1 set out in the Schedule— (a) orally, subject to section 56(3) of the Act; (b) through electronic means, including email, web posting, complaint management information system; or (c) by any other appropriate means. (3) A complaint under subregulation (1) may be lodged— (a) by the complainant in person; (b) by a person acting on behalf of the complainant; (c) by any other person authorized by law to act on behalf of a data subject; or (d) anonymously. (4) The Data Commissioner shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint within seven days of receipt of the complaint under subregulation (1). (5) The complaint under subregulation (1) shall be lodged free of charge.”






17.
The Court of Appeal in Geoffrey Muthinja & another v Samuel Muguna Henry & 1756 others [2015] eKLR observed as follows:
“
It is imperative that where a dispute resolution mechanism exists outside courts, the same be exhausted before the jurisdiction of the courts is invoked. Courts ought to be the fora of last resort and not the first port of call the moment a storm brews within churches, as is bound to happen. The exhaustion doctrine is a sound one and serves the purpose of ensuring that there is a postponement of judicial consideration of matters to ensure that a party is first of all diligent in the protection of his own interest within the mechanisms in place for resolution outside of courts. This accords with Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 which commands Courts to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution.”






18.
Similarly in Oucho v Joseph Otieno Bee, Chief Executive Officer Bandari Sacco Ltd & 12 others; Sacco Society Regulatory Authority (SASRA) (Interested Party) (Constitutional Petiti
on 57 of 2021
) [2022] KEHC 6 (KLR) (25 January 2022) (Ruling), the court (JM Mativo J. as he then was) held that:-
“
The second principle suggested by case law for limiting the applicability of the doctrine of exhaustion in appropriate cases is that a statutory provision providing an alternative forum for dispute resolution must be carefully read so as not to oust the jurisdiction of the court to consider valid grievances from parties who may not have audience before the forum created, or who may not have the quality of audience before the forum which is proportionate to the interests the party wishes to advance in a suit. The rationale behind this reasoning is that statutory provisions ousting court's jurisdiction must be construed restrictively. The next question is whether the dispute resolution mechanism established under the Act is competent to resolve the issues raised in this Petition. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is expressly provided under section 76 of the act. No serious argument was advanced to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain the dispute.”






19.
In the scheme of the Data Protection Act, this court’s jurisdiction may only be properly invoked in terms of section 64 as follows:
“
A person against whom any administrative action is taken by the Data Commissioner, including in enforcement and penalty notices, may appeal to the High Court.”






20.
A leading decision on the doctrines of exhaustion of remedy and constitutional avoidance is the well-known case of the 
Speaker of the National Assembly v Karume (Civil Application 92 of 1992
) [1992] KECA 42 (KLR) (29 May 1992) (Ruling) where Court of Appeal (Kwach, Cockar and Muli, JJA.) was emphatic that -
“
[T]here is considerable merit in the submission that where there is a clear procedure for the redress of any particular grievance prescribed by 
the Constitution
 or an Act of Parliament, that procedure should be strictly followed.”






21.
In the Supreme Court decision of Nicholus v Attorney General & 7 others; National Environmental Complaints Committee
 & 5 others (Interested Parties) (Petition E007 of 2023
) [2023] KESC 113 (KLR) (28 December 2023) (Judgment), the Court considered the issue and held:
“
90.
On our part, in 
NGOs Co-ordination Board v EG & 4 others; Katiba Institute (Amicus Curiae) (Petition 16 of 2019
) [2023] KESC 17 (KLR) (Constitutional and Human Rights) (24 February 2023) (Judgment) (NGOs Co-ordination Board) we outlined the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and adopted our finding in Albert Chaurembo Mumbo & 7 others v Maurice Munyao & 148 others; SC Petiti
on No 3 of 2016
, [2019] eKLR where we held that:
“... even where superior courts had jurisdiction to determine profound questions of law, the first opportunity had to be given to relevant persons, bodies, tribunals or any other quasi-judicial authorities and organs to deal with the dispute as provided for in the relevant parent statute.”
92.
In the above decision, we furthermore emphasized that, where there exists an alternative method of dispute resolution established by legislation, courts must exercise restraint in exercising their jurisdiction as conferred by 
the Constitution
 and must give deference to the dispute resolution bodies established by statute with the mandate to deal with such specific disputes in the first instance.”






22.
Since the enactment of the Data Protection Act, the jurisdiction of the High Court to remedy breaches of the constitutional right to privacy under Article 31 must on the principle of the constitutional avoidance and doctrine of exhaustion, be last resort and appellate forum in terms of the Statute or where it is demonstrated that the scheme of process and remedy under the Act is not such as to afford quality redress or appropriate relief.






23.
In this case, it was not demonstrated that the remedy and mechanism of the statutory process under the Data Protecti
on Act of 2019
, was not capable of providing appropriate remedy in the circumstances of the case. Fair hearing before the Data Commissioner is not an inferior remedy as 
the Constitution
 under Article 50 (1) recognizes tribunal and bodies established by law as capable of giving effect to the right to fair hearing as follows:
“
50. (1)
Every person has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair and public hearing before a court or, if appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or body.”






24.
Consequently, this court finds that the dispute herein falls within the ambit of section 56 of the Data Protection Act and it ought, in the first instance, to be heard by the Data Commissioner, and thereafter on appeal to the High Court in terms of section 64 of the Act. The Court, therefore, declines to take up jurisdiction in the matter on account of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies.








Orders


25.
Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, this court makes the following orders:
1.
The Petition dated 7/3/2023 is struck out.
2.
There shall be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.

Introduction


1.
Florence Thoithi and Hellen Wangeci Nyakundi, (petitioners), members Nyayo Embakasi Residents Association (the association), brought this petition against Teddy Obiero, Eddah Marete, Andrew Kagume and Winnie Obaga, officials and members of the executive committee of the association, the respondents.






2.
The petitioners joined the Registrar of Societies, (the Registrar) a public official, appointed under section 8 of the 
Societies Act
, Cap 108, (the Act) whose mandate is, among others, to register, de-register and preside over issues involving associations registered under the Act; The association of Residents of Nyayo Estate Embakasi, Nairobi and Fridah Namboka, Irene Irungu, George Lamenya, Leonard Waruinge, Antony Yongo, trustees of of the association as the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 interested parties, respectively.








Petitioners’ case


3.
The petitioners’ case is that, on 26
th
 January 2020, the association held its Annual General Meeting (AGM) in which the respondents were elected. They were to hold office until the 25
th
 January 2021 when another AGM was to be held and new officials elected.






4.
The petitioners stated that the respondents have failed to call for the AGM, thereby obstructing the elections of new officials of the association. As a result of this failure, the association faces potential de-registration.






5.
The petitioners asserted that according to the association’s constitution, the respondents’ position as officials expired automatically on 25
th
 January 2021, leaving only the 3
rd
 Interested party, a fact also confirmed by the Registrar’s letter dated 5
th
 December 2022.






6.
The petitioners argued that the foregoing notwithstanding, the respondents have purported to continue acting as officials of the association in violation of the members right to freedom of association guaranteed under Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
.






7.
The petitioners stated that the respondents also failed to provide particulars requested for by the Registrar such as audited accounts which would have facilitated the calling of an AGM and holding of elections. Failure to hold elections has effectively hindered the continued existence of the association as a legal entity.






8.
According to the petitioners, the Registrar had mandated the Trustees to call for an AGM and conduct elections upon respondents submitting a list of members and names and contacts of the Trustees of the association but to no avail. Meanwhile, the respondents purported to issue a notice dated 1
st
 February 2024, calling for an AGM on 3
rd
 March 2024 without any lawful mandate since they were not officials. The notice was also sent a few select members leaving out a majority of members of the members.






9.
The petitioners argued therefore, that the respondents have violated members’ rights guaranteed under Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
 to associate and hold elections and vie for vacant positions in the decision-making process in the association.






10.
The petitioners take the position that the respondents’ default has caused vacancy in the office. Their mandate lapsed and, therefore, cannot lawfully call for any AGM and no lawful elections can be held under the 
Societies Act
, unless the court extends the time to do so.






11.
On the basis of the foregoing, the petitioners seek the following reliefs:
a.
A declaration that the respondent, and specifically Teddy Obiero, Eddah Marete, Andrew Kagume and WINNIE OBAGA, being immediate former officials / former Chairman, former Secretary, former treasurer and former Organising Secretary respectively of the Executive Committee of the Nyayo Embakasi Residents’ Association (NERA), are in office illegally and without the mandate of 
the constitution
 of the 2
nd
 interested party, the Nyayo Embakasi Residents Association (NERA), w.e.f 25
th
 January 2021.
b.
A declaration that the respondent’s (TEddy Obiero, Eddah Marete, Andrew Kagume And Winnie Obaga) continued acts and omissions after 25
th
 January 2021 and or so, and its obstruction of elections of new officials, were undertaken without the constitutional mandate of the 2
nd
 interested party, the Nyayo Embakasi Residents Association (NERA) and therefore violated the constitutional right to freedom of association guaranteed under article 36 (1) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010 of the petitioners and of the residents of Nyayo Estate Embakasi Nairobi, are therefore a nullity and are hereby set aside.
c.
An order of mandatory injunction compelling the 3
rd
 interested party to call for an annual general meeting under the supervision of the registrar of the societies, the 1
st
 interested party, as guided by NERA’s Constitution.
d.
The legal validity and registration of the Nyayo Embakasi Estate Association (NERA) be and is hereby extended for purposes of elections ordered under this petition.
e.
An order that a forensic audit of the Nyayo Embakasi Residents’ Association (NERA) financial statements and books of accounts be undertaken.
f.
An order of accounts and a refund by the respondent (Teddy Obiero, Eddah Marete, Andrew Kagume And Winnie Obaga) of any monies of the Nyayo Embakasi Residents’ Association that they have withdrawn from its bank account from the 25
th
 January 2021 to date.
g.
Costs.
h.
Interest.








Respondents’ case


12.
The respondents had not filed responses and submissions at the time of hearing this petition, although their advocate had been granted time to do so. However, there are documents on the CTS, namely; an application dated 18
th
 June 2024, seeking to arrest the judgment and to deem a replying affidavit by the 1
st
 respondent dully filed as well as written submissions. The application was not moved and, therefore, the court will not consider these documents.








Determination


13.
I have considered the petition, supporting affidavit and written submissions. I have also gone through the supporting affidavit and annextures to that affidavit. The issue for determination is whether the petitioners’ rights under Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
 have been violated.






14.
As already pointed above, on 13
th
 March 2024, the respondents had not filed responses to the petition on grounds that they had not been mapped in the system. The court granted them time to file responses and issued directions on filing submissions by parties and set the date for highlighting of submissions for 3
rd
 May 2024. On that day, 3
rd
 May 2024, the respondents had not filed their documents and sought an adjournment which the court declined. The petition was heard and judgment reserved.






15.
As already stated, at the time of writing the judgment, there was a replying affidavit sworn by the 1
st
 respondent, written submissions and an application for leave to admit the replying affidavit and written submissions. That application having not been moved; those documents were not admitted since they were filed after lapse of the time granted.






16.
The Petitioners and 1
st
 to 5
th
 respondents are members of the association. The 1
st
 to 4
th
 respondents also double-up as executive committee officials of the association.






17.
The petitioners’ case is that the respondents as executive committee members have failed to hold an annual general meeting of the association following expiry of their term thereby denying the residents and members of the association the right to elect officials of their association, a violation of their right of association guaranteed under Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
. Further, the association risks deregistration for failure to comply with the provisions of the 
Societies Act
.






18.
Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
 confers on every person the right to freedom of association, which includes the right to form, join or participate in the activities of an association of any kind. On the other hand, the association, the subject of the dispute before court, is a society registered under the 
Societies Act
. It is therefore subject to the provisions of that Act and its constitution when it comes to dealing with internal disputes.






19.
The dispute herein relates to holding of the association’s annual general meeting and election of executive committee members. Holding of meetings and conduct of elections is governed by the association’s constitution. I will come to this aspect later.






20.
Section 17(1) of the 
Societies Act
 states that in case of change of officials or title of any office in a registered Society, a notice of such change should be given to the Registrar within fourteen days of that change. The notice has to be signed by three of the officers of the society.






21.
On disputes, section 18 provides thus:
1.
If the Registrar is of the opinion that a dispute has occurred among the members or officers of a registered society as a result of which the Registrar is not satisfied as to the identity of the persons who have been properly constituted as officers of the society, the Registrar may, by order in writing, require the society to produce to him, within one month of the service of the order, evidence of the settlement of the dispute and of the proper appointment of the lawful officers of the society or of the institution of proceedings for the settlement of such dispute.
2.
If an order under subsection (1) of this section is not complied with to the satisfaction of the Registrar within the period of one month or any longer period which the Registrar may allow, the Registrar may cancel the registration of the society.
3.
A society aggrieved by the cancellation of its registration under subsection (2) may appeal to the High Court within thirty days of such cancellation.






22.
The Act provides a mechanism through which the Registrar may deal with disputes over leadership in a registered society and the actions the Registrar may take, including deregistration. An aggrieved society may appeal against the Registrar’s decision to the High Court.






23.
I have gone through 
the constitution
 of the association annexed to the petitioners’ affidavit. Clause D of the association’s constitution is on general meetings. Clause D-3 states that if the executive committee fails to call annual general meeting by last Sunday of November, the Estate Moderator and Trustees shall declare the Estate Committee seats vacant and proceed to call Special General Election. Should the Estate Moderator and Trustees fail to hold elections by the last Sunday of November, the Estate Council shall appoint other Trustees to oversee election of an Estate Moderator who should in turn, hold special general elections.






24.
It is therefore plain, that the association’s constitution provides for a clear internal procedure for managing elections should the executive committee fail to do so. Clause D-3 is self-executing and does not require external assistance. There is no evidence, however, that clause D- 3 was invoked if not, no explanation has been given.






25.
The petitioners argued that the Registrar wrote to the respondents calling for documents for purposes of resolving the dispute but the respondents did not comply. This appears to agree with the essence of section 18 of the 
Societies Act
 on how the Registrar may resolve disputes in a society. The petitioners also seem to say that the Registrar is seized of the matter relating to that dispute. If that is true that the Registrar is seized of the matter, which appears to be the case any way, then the dispute herein, if any, is still in the hands of the Registrar who has to make a decision which can then be challenged before this court.






26.
In that respect, this petition is premature since the Registrar must be allowed to exercise his mandate under the Act before this court is called upon to review such decision, if necessary.






27.
The petitioners argued that they were apprehensive that their association faced the risk of being deregistered because the respondents had not held an annual general meeting and elections for executive committee officials. Apprehension that the association may be deregistered, is not a violation of rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, the law to deregister the association has not been invoked. In any case, there is a remedy in the law that the association may fall back to. The claim of violation of constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms must be real and well-founded, but not a mere conjecture.






28.
Moreover, the issue here being an internal matter of elections in a society governed by internal rules and procedures, the petitioners must follow their constitution before alleging violation of constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed in Article 36(1) of 
the Constitution
. This is because, the right of association is a right of all members and not a few. It would be difficult to hold that there is violation of the right of association when members of the association have not adhered to their own constitution in resolving their internal disputes.






29.
Looking at the totality of this petition and the reliefs sought, they are clearly matters that have nothing to do with violation of 
the Constitution
 and fundament rights in the Bill of Rights. Consequently, the petition fails and is dismissed.






30.
Since the dispute involves residents and members of one association, I make no order on costs.

2.
The application was premised on the grounds on the face of the summons and supported by the Petitioners’ supporting affidavit dated 31
st
 January 2015.






3.
Opposing the summons for confirmation of grant, the Objectors herein filed their respective affidavits in protest sworn on 21
st
 April 2015 wherein they individually averred that the deceased did not leave only property L.R. Bokoli/Bokoli/195 as alleged by the Petitioners but that the deceased had a plot at Machakha Market measuring 50×100 and pension as he had been a police officer. They contend that they are not privy to any information that the deceased’s surviving daughter Margaret Nekesa opted not to benefit from the estate. They further contend that the proposed mode of distribution by the Petitioners was not approved by all family members.






4.
Upon perusal of the Court file, it is noted that Margaret Nekesa Muchemi did file her consent dated 7
th
 May 2015, wherein she stated that she had no interest in getting a share from the estate of the deceased as she is settled with her family elsewhere.






5.
The Objectors filed their mode of distribution dated 10
th
 July 2018 in Court on 11
th
 July 2018. They proposed the estate of the deceased be divided as follows:
a.
L.R. Bokoli/Bokoli/195

b.
L.R. Bokoli/Bokoli/199 measuring 50×100 purchased by the deceased- to be shared equally.
c.
Pension of the deceased who was a retired police officer -to be shared equally.






7.
Vide directions issued on 14
th
 June 2022, this Court ordered the County Surveyor Bungoma to visit the land in question, L.R. Bokoli/Bokoli/195, to implement a Court order issued on 24
th
 June 2021.






8.
Vide a report dated 19
th
 July 2022, the County Surveyor Bungoma noted that he visited the land in question, L.R. Bokoli/Bokoli/195, and in the presence of the 1
st
 Petitioner herein, the 4
th
 Objector and Douglas Mulongo Barasa he conducted the requisite survey where they established that the total actual ground Acreage of the property to be 19.0 HA (47.5 Acres) which was divided into two portions. The 1
st
 portion measured 14.50 HA and it was located in the upland area while the 2
nd
 portion measures 4.50 HA which was located in the lowland.






9.
Vide directions issued on 18
th
 May 2024, the parties were to file their respective further affidavits in reaction to the survey report dated 19
th
 July 2022.






10.
Vide affidavit in protest to the survey report dated 19
th
 July 2022, the Objectors averred that they were not notified in time to attend the survey exercise and that it ought to have measured each person’s actual ground occupation to help with the confirmation process and that was what their late father distributed to them. They contended that the grant be confirmed according to the area given by the deceased on the dry (upland) area while the swampy area to be shared equally. They also proposed that the one plot at Machakha market be sold and proceeds shared equally. Finally, they proposed that the 1
st
 and 4
th
 petitioners be ordered to account for the deceased’s pension which they received for five years.






11.
The summons for confirmation of grant dated 31
st
 January 2015 and the affidavits in Protest were to be canvassed via written submissions. The parties duly complied.






12.
I have carefully considered the application, the affidavits tendered by the parties herein, and their rival submissions. I find the main issue for determination is whether this Court can issue the orders sought.






13.
The deceased died in 2000, after the 
Law of Succession Act
, cap 160, Laws of Kenya, had come into force in 1981. By dint of Section 2(1), the law to apply to the distribution of the estate is the 
Law of Succession Act
. For avoidance of doubt, section 2(1) of the Laws of Succession Act provides as follows; -
“
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act or any other written law, the provisions of this Act shall constitute the law of Kenya in respect of, and shall have universal application to, all cases of intestate or testamentary succession to the estates of deceased persons dying after, the commencement of this Act and to the administration of estates of those persons.”






14.
As per the petitioning documents, the property comprising the estate of the deceased was LR. No. Bokoli/Bokoli/195 and according to Pridegeon Barasa Masake’s statement, the deceased was survived by: Geoffrey N. Barasa, Grace Muthuiembo Barasa (deceased), Pridgeon M. Barasa, Maclean K. Barasa, Leonard Wangila Barasa (deceased), Sandys K. Barasa, Metrine Mukhwana Barasa (deceased), Margret Mukhwana Barasa and Douglas M. Barasa.






15.
The Court upon the application for confirmation of grant being made may confirm the grant or, if not satisfied that the applicant will properly administer the estate issue a confirmed grant to another person or persons or order the postponement of the confirmation. Section 71(2)(a) of the Act and the proviso to subsection (2) state as follows: -
“
(2)
The court to which application is made, or to which any dispute in respect thereof is referred, may –
(a)
If it is satisfied that the grant was rightly made to the applicant, and that he is administering, and will administer, the estate according to law, confirm the grant; or…
Provided that, in cases of intestacy, the grant of letters of administration shall not be confirmed until the court is satisfied as to the respective identities of the all persons beneficially entitled: and when confirmed the grant shall specify all such persons and their respective shares.”






16.
After a thorough perusal of both parties’ proposed modes of distribution, it is clear that they used the wrong actual ground Acreage and thus the interests of the deceased siblings have not been catered for. Bearing in mind the consent dated 7
th
 May 2015, as filed by the deceased’s surviving daughter Margaret Nekesa Muchemi relinquishing her share of the deceased’s estate, then the estate will have to be shared amongst the sons of the deceased. The 1
st
 and 4
th
 Petitioners are of the view that the estate be shared equally while the objectors want the portions of the lands be maintained just like when they were given by the deceased. The County Surveyor did visit the land in question and came up with the size of the whole land on the ground which has a total Acreage of 19.0 HA (47.50 Acres) and comprises of upper dry portion measuring 14.50 HA (32.25 Acres) and the low land (swampy) measuring 4.50 HA (11.25 Acres). It is noted that the survey report does not indicate the specific shares of the portions occupied by each beneficiary on the ground. It is also instructive that none of the parties herein availed any family minutes or called witnesses to corroborate their assertions that the deceased subdivided his land to his children prior to his death. I find in the absence of such evidence, the estate must be shared equally among the beneficiaries.






17.
The objectors have claimed that there is a plot measuring 50x100 at Machakha market and have proposed that the same be sold and proceeds shared equally. However, none of the parties have availed the requisite documents such as a search certificate confirming that the same belonged to the deceased. The objector have merely claimed that the said property is yet to be registered in the Names of the deceased. Hence, until the same is done, such property will not be eligible for distribution. The said property will therefore be discounted but the petitioners are at liberty to move the court appropriately for rectification of grant once new assets are discovered.






18.
The objectors have also averred that the 1
st
 and 4
th
 Petitioners have benefitted from the pension of the deceased for a period of five years and that they should now be ordered to render accounts. It is noted that the Objectors did not present documentary evidence to back their claim and hence I find the same has not been proved.






19.
In view of the foregoing observations, it is my finding that the 1
st
 and 4
th
 Petitioners’ proposed mode of distribution of the estate is quite reasonable and fair and must be okayed. The Objectors’ mode of distribution is not workable and discriminative in view of the lack of evidence of distribution of the land by the deceased prior to his demise. Consequently, the Objectors’ protest lacks merit and is dismissed. The grant made to the petitioners herein on 15
th
 May, 2014 is hereby confirmed and that the estate of the deceased comprised in land parcel number Bokoli/Bokoli/195 both upper land (dry) and lowland (swampy) shall be distributed as follows:

          (Appeal arising out of the judgment, conviction and sentence by Hon. M.I.G Moranga (SPM) in Kitale Chief Magistrate’s Court Criminal Case (S.O.) No. 228 of 2019 delivered on 27   th   January 2021)
        
      






Judgment










Background:


1.
Wycliffe Mayuu Mamianyanga, the Appellant herein, was charged with of the offence of Rape contrary to Section 7 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






2.
The particulars of the offence were that, on the 3
rd
 day of October 2019 at [particulars withheld] within Trans-Nzoia County, intentionally caused your genital organ namely penis to penetrate the genital organ namely vagina of S.S.W. by force and threat without her consent.






3.
The Appellant faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act with an adult contrary to Section 11(A) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






4.
The particulars of the offence were that on 3
rd
 day of October 2019 at [particulars withheld] within Trans-Nzoia County, intentionally caused contact between his genital organ namely penis and the genital organ namely, vagina of S.S.W., without her consent.






5.
At the trial Court, the Appellant was found guilty and accordingly convicted for the offence of rape.






6.
He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.








The Appeal:


7.
Dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, the Appellant raised the following grounds of appeal in urging the Court to quash the conviction and set aside the sentence: -
1.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in failing to hold that the complainant and other prosecution witnesses did know I the appellant and hence I was not the perpetrator of the alleged offence.
2.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in failing to find that the evidence of PW5 exonerated I the appellant form the offence in dispute and further the prosecution failed to prove penetration.
3.
That the learned magistrate erred in failing to consider the credible defence put forth by I the Appellant.






8.
In his submissions in support of the appeal, the Appellant stated that the evidence of the Clinical Officer exonerated him and that the Prosecution failed to prove penetration.






9.
It was his case that while PW4 stated that the complainant had gonorrhoea, no tests were conducted to ascertain whether he contracted the disease in violation of the requirements of Section 36(i) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






10.
It further was his case that that since there was no spermatozoa in the evidence of PW5, the aspect of penetration was not proved. He submitted that the filing of P3 Form 3 days after his arrest occasioned him miscarriage of justice.






11.
In conclusion, the Appellant submitted that his defence was not considered and that he had established his alibi on the material date.






12.
He urged this Court to allow the appeal, quash the conviction and set-aside the sentence.








The Respondent’s case:


13.
The Respondent urged its case through written submissions dated 11
th
 June 2023. It was its position, based on the decision in Peter Wanjala Wanyonyi -vs- Republic (2018) eKLR that it established beyond reasonable doubt penetration, lack of consent and the identity of the perpetrator.








Analysis:


14.
This being a first appeal, it’s the duty of this Court to re-consider and to re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial Court with a view to arriving at its own independent conclusions and findings (See Okono vs. Republic [1972] EA 74). In doing so, this Court is required to take cognizance of the fact that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses as they testified before the trial Court and, therefore, it ought to give due regard in that respect as so held in Ajode v. Republic [2004] KLR 81.






15.
This Court is, therefore, supposed to determine whether the offence of rape or committing an indecent act with an adult was proved beyond reasonable doubt and, if so, whether it was committed by the Appellant.






16.
The starting point is how the offence of rape is described in law. Section 3 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) defines 'rape' as follows: -
1.
A person commits the offence termed rape if –
(a)
he or she intentionally and unlawfully commits an act which causes penetration with his or her genital organs;
(b)
the other person does not consent to the penetration; or
(c)
the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind.
(2)
In this section the term “intentionally and unlawfully” has the meaning assigned to it in section 43 of this Act.
(3)
A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may be enhanced to imprisonment for life.






17.
From the above definition, the ingredients of the offence of rape, therefore, include proof that the victim was not a minor, proof of penetration, proof of the perpetrator and proof that the consent was not freely given.






18.
On looking at those aspects in this judgment, this Court shall consider each of them singly. I must however confirm that the evidence was well captured in the judgment under appeal and I hereby adopt the same as part of this decision by reference.






19.
In a snapshot, six witnesses testified before the trial Court. However, the Complainant, S.S.W., did not testify as she was mentally challenged and was not well oriented of time and events. The Complainant’s sitter-in-law one Electina Naliaka testified as PW1, the complainant’s elder brother one William Moi Werunga, testified as PW2, Emmanuel Wepukhulu Wanyonyi, a neighbour to the complainant testified as PW3. Musa Chepkiyen, a Clinical officer attached at the Endebes Sub- County Hospital testified as PW5,PC Violet Ounoi, the Investigating Officer testified as PW4. PW6 was Dr. Felister Mwangi, a Consultant Psychiatrist.






20.
The Court will now endeavour a consideration of the ingredients of the offence of rape.








Age of the complainant:


21.
The age of the complainant was not contested in this appeal. Witnesses and even some of the exhibits on record indicated that the complainant was 36 years old at the time of the alleged sexual molestation.






22.
The complainant was, hence, not a minor in law.








Penetration:


23.
The evidence on penetration was attested to by several witnesses.






24.
It was PW1’s evidence that on the material day, the complainant left home and did not return. As it was getting dark, family members decided to look for the complainant, more so since she was mentally-challenged.






25.
They eventually found the Appellant in an abandoned house within the place where the Appellant lived. On pushing the door open, PW1 found the Appellant and the complainant lying on a mattress. She pulled the blanket which they had covered themselves and found that they having sexual intercourse in a near ‘doggy style’.






26.
She later recorded a statement with the police and escorted the complainant to hospital for treatment. She identified the complainant’s treatment notes and test request form.






27.
PW2 stated that they found the Appellant and the complainant [her sister] naked. That, the police were called and the Appellant arrested. The blankets and beddings were recovered by the police.






28.
The testimony of PW3 was to the effect that when they arrived at the Appellant’s place, he had a ‘D-light lamp’ and when they pushed the door open, they found the Appellant naked and having sex with the complainant from the rear.






29.
PW5 examined the Appellant at the hospital. He found that her external genitalia were in order, but her internal genitalia had lacerations on the vaginal wall and had abnormal discharge. It was his testimony that swabs from the vagina indicated that she was infected with gonorrhoea, a venereal disease. He further indicated that there were no spermatozoa since the complainant was uncooperative and erratic and that the gadget they would have used to extract the specimen would have caused more damage.






30.
There is no doubt that for the offence of rape to be committed, there has to be penetration. Section 2(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines “penetration” to mean “the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person.”






31.
This position was fortified in Mark Oiruri Mose vs R (2013) eKLR when the Court of Appeal stated thus: -
…. Many times, the attacker does not fully complete the sexual act during commission of the offence. That is the main reason why the law does not require that evidence of spermatozoa be availed. So long as there is penetration whether only on the surface, the ingredient of the offence is demonstrated, and penetration need not be deep inside the girl’s organ…. (emphasis added).






32.
Later, the Court of Appeal, then differently constituted, in Erick Onyango Ondeng v. Republic (2014) eKLR held as such on the aspect of penetration: -
In sexual offences, the slightest penetration of a female sex organ by a male sex organ is sufficient to constitute the offence. It is not necessary that the hymen be ruptured.






33.
From the definition of penetration and the guidance by the Court of Appeal, it is the position that penetration may only be ‘slightest and to the surface’ to suffice in law. It, therefore, means that there may be instances where the slight penetration, depending on other factors including passage of time, may not be possible to be ascertained by way of medical evidence. Therefore, the failure to prove penetration by medical evidence does not ipsa facto mean that there was no penetration. It all depends on the peculiar circumstances of a case and the extent to which the trial Court believes the victim. However, in such instances, the Court must exercise extreme caution as to weed out miscarriage of justice including instances where a victim is framed up for ulterior motives.






34.
Deriving from the above, the totality of the evidence of both the eye witnesses and the Clinical Officer point to the occurrence of a sexual encounter. PW1, PW2 and PW3 were eye witnesses. They saw the Appellant lying naked from the rear side of the complainant.






35.
The Court has perused the medical examination report produced as an exhibit. The Report indicated that there were lacerations on complainant’s vaginal wall. PW5 made the conclusion that it was an indication that there was sexual intercourse within 24 hours of examination.






36.
The evidence of the Appellant did not challenge or dislodge the incidence of a sexual encounter. To that extent, it is this Court’s finding that the trial Court did not err in the finding that there was penetration.








Identification:


37.
PW1, PW2 and PW3 were eye witnesses. They gave a vivid account of the fact that when they pushed the door open, the Appellant was in there lying naked and having sex with the complainant from the back.






38.
On his part, the Appellant’s raised the claim of alibi. He denied committing the offence and narrated how he was arrested.






39.
However, the witnesses stated that they recognized the Appellant, arrested him in the act, called the police and handed him over.






40.
Recognition is a critical component in identification of a perpetrator. In Anjononi & Others vs. Republic [1980] KLR 59 the Court of Appeal made the following remarks;
...recognition of an assailant is more satisfactory, more reassuring, and more reliable than identification of a stranger because it depends upon the personal knowledge of the assailant in some form or another.






41.
It is on record that PW1, PW2 and PW3 knew the Appellant well. They had known him variously as a resident of their area for a period of 4 to 5 years. They referred to the Appellant by his name and emphasized that the person they arrested and handed over to the police was no other than the Appellant.






42.
On the basis of the foregoing, this Court finds and hold that the Appellant’s identification by way of recognition was not in error. He was positively identified as the perpetrator.








Consent:


43.
The Mental Assessment Report produced by PW6 dated 25
th
 November 2019 indicated that the complainant suffered from psychosis.






44.
It was PW6’s evidence that during examination, the Complainant was jumping on chairs, did not know where she was neither did she know home. PW6 concluded that the complainant was unable to make logical decisions based on reality.






45.
The concept of consent was discussed by the Court of Appeal in Republic -vs- Oyier [1985] KLR 35 as follows: -
1.
The lack of consent is an essential element of the crime of rape. The mens rea in rape is primarily an intention and not a state of mind. The mental element is to have intercourse without consent or not caring whether the woman consented or not.
2.
To prove the mental element required in rape, the prosecution had to prove that the complainant physically resisted or, if she did not, that her understanding and knowledge were such that she was not in a position to decide whether to consent or resist.
3.
Where a woman yields through fear of death, or through duress, it is rape and it is no excuse that the woman consented first, if the offence was afterwards committed by force or against her will; nor is it any excuse that she consented after the fact.






46.
There is evidence that the complainant was mentally-challenged and could not make any logical decisions. Such a person could definitely not have consented to a sexual endeavour. Therefore, the Appellant intentionally and unlawfully caused his penis to penetrate the genital organ of the Complainant without her consent.






47.
In the end, having considered the evidence and the law, this Court is satisfied that all the ingredients of the offence of rape were established beyond reasonable doubt and that it was the Appellant who as the perpetrator.






48.
The appeal on conviction, therefore, fails.








Disposition:


49.
As there was no challenge to the sentence rendered, it is prudent that this discussion ends here.






50.
As I come to the end of this judgment, I wish to render my unreserved apologies to the parties in this matter for the delay in rendering this decision. The delay was occasioned by the fact that since my transfer from Nairobi, I have been handling matters from the Constitutional & Human Rights Division, Kitale and Kapenguria High Courts. Further, I was appointed as a Member of the Presidential Tribunal investigating the conduct of a Judge in March 2024 thereby mostly being away from the station. Apologies galore.






51.
Consequently, the following final Orders hereby issue: -
a.
The Appeal is wholly dismissed.
b.
The file is hereby marked as closed.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an appeal against the Ruling of CAS Mutai-SPM Bungoma dated and delivered on the 18th October 2022 in Bungoma Chief Magistrate’s Court Misc. Civil Application No. 585 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 98,693.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling in grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and Supporting Affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s reference fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2) where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable






4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.






5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstrable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 12
th
 March 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KCG 126G to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 412,200.25/=. The enclosed letter of instruction was duly completed and executed. The 1
st
 Respondent was instructed to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -




No.

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000) 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham (1991) 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs. 131,693.81/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.98,693.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 98,693.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the Learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.
It so ordered.

Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September, 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18

 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st

 September, 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2).
where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable
4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.
5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 21
st
 August 2020, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KBQ 094C and ZC 1990 to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 1,025,513.85/=. The enclosed letter of instruction was duly completed and executed. The 1
st
 Respondent was instructed to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -




No.

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000) 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham (1991) 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs. 281,801.49/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.236,801.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 236,801.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the Learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.
No
It so ordered.

          (Being an appeal against the Ruling of CAS Mutai-SPM Bungoma dated and delivered on the 18th October 2022 in Bungoma Chief Magistrate’s Court Misc. Civil Application No. 587 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September, 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 69,639.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling on grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission v Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another [2014] eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and supporting affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September, 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instruction letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2) where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable""
4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.
5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 22
nd
 November 2019, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KCF 230M to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 128,664.35/=. They duly completed and executed letter of instruction and instructed the 1st Respondent to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -




No.

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd [2000] 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham [1991] 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs 86,439.83/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.69,639.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 69,639.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.




It so ordered.

          (Being an appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Voi (J. M. Mativo, J.) delivered on 27th October 2014 in HCCRA No. E051 of 2021)
        
      






Judgment










1.
This is a second appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Voi (J. M. Mativo, J.) dated 19
th
 October 2022 and delivered on 27
th
 October 2022 by O. Sewe, J. in Criminal Appeal No. E051 of 2021. By the impugned judgment, the High Court upheld the appellant’s conviction and sentence in Voi Sexual Offence Case No. 2 of 2017 (F. M. Nyakundi, SRM) vide the trial court’s judgment dated 7
th
 October 2017 and sentence on 14
th
 October 2017.






2.
The genesis of the appeal before us is that the appellant was charged before the Magistrate’s Court at Voi in Sexual Offence Case No. 2 of 2017 with the offence of incest contrary to section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 (the Act). The particulars of the offence were that, on 28
th
 August 2016 at about 9:00pm at Buguta village within Taita Taveta County, the appellant intentionally caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of PM, a child aged 17 years who, to his knowledge, was his daughter. The appellant was alternatively charged with the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case proceeded to hearing whereupon the prosecution called eight (8) witnesses.






3.
The complainant (PW1) stated that, on 28
th
 August 2016, her mother, Kwekwe GC (PW4), had gone for a funeral in Samburu when, at around 9:00pm, the appellant came into the house which the complainant shared with her brother and demanded food; that the complainant informed the appellant that his food was in his house; that the appellant suddenly grabbed the complainant by the neck and tripped her to the ground; that the complainant had only wrapped herself with a leso and had nothing underneath; that the appellant pulled off her leso and removed his trouser with one hand, warning her not to scream; that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her; and that it was the first time she ever had sexual intercourse.






4.
According to PW1, her younger brother was asleep in his room and did not hear anything; that there was no light at the time, but that there was moonlight; and that she also recognised the appellant’s voice. PW1 testified further that she did not inform her mother (PW4) of the incident because of the appellant’s threats; and that she later discovered that she was pregnant.






5.
PW4, the complainant’s mother, stated that, in March 2017, she noticed that the complainant was pregnant and confronted her over it, but that the complainant remained evasive. PW4 stated further that the appellant was arrested when she had taken the complainant for examination at Buguta dispensary; and that the complainant gave birth on 13
th
 May 2017, but that the baby did not survive.






6.
JET (PW2), the headmaster of the complainant’s school, stated that, on 14
th
 February 2017, he was informed that the complainant appeared disturbed; that he interrogated the complainant on 17
th
 February 2017, and she confirmed that she was 6-months pregnant; and that the appellant was responsible therefor. PW2 reported the matter to the police.






7.
PW3, Corporal Douglas Mwakarabo, a police officer attached to Emali Administrative Police Post, received the complainant in the company of PW2 and a clinical officer from Buguta Dispensary on 17
th
 February 2017. PW3 stated that PW2 alleged that the appellant, who was known to him, had impregnated the complainant. PW3 subsequently arrested the appellant on 18
th
 February 2017.






8.
PW5, Lucy Nyambura Wangoi, a nurse at Buguta Health Centre, stated that the complainant was brought in on 18
th
 February 2017 by her mother and the police; and that a pregnancy test revealed that the complainant was about 6-7 months pregnant. PW6, Dr. Sumeita Seif, a doctor at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital at Voi, stated that the complainant gave birth on 13
th
 May 2017, but that the baby died 35 minutes later. According to PW6, DNA samples were taken from the body before it was released for burial.






9.
PW8, George Lawrence Oguda, a principal chemist at the government chemist, testified that he was presented with five exhibits under instructions from the court to examine them and determine the paternity of a deceased infant; that all the samples from the infant did not generate any DNA profile, and that he was therefore unable to compare the DNA profile generated from buccal swabs obtained from the appellant with that of the infant. However, PW8 stated that there were 99% chances that the appellant was the complainant’s biological father.






10.
When found to have a case to answer, the appellant gave a sworn statement in his defence. He stated that, on the material date, he was at a burial with his wife and were away for 3 days before they returned. He denied committing the offence. On cross-examination, the appellant stated that, on the material day, he left home with his wife (PW4) for a ceremony not far from his home at 4:00 pm; that they were away for 3 days; that they left the children, including the complainant, at home; that he did not know why he was arrested; that he had not known that the complainant was pregnant; and that the complainant never disclosed who the father of the child was.






11.
After the appellant’s testimony, PW4 was recalled and testified in his defence as DW2. She stated that, on 28
th
 September 2016, she and the appellant were away attending a burial where they stayed for 3 days before returning home; and that she did not know why he was arrested.






12.
In its judgment dated 7
th
 October 2019, the trial court found that, at the time of defilement, the complainant was 17 years of age as corroborated by the immunization card produced bearing her date of birth; that there was no doubt that the complainant recognized her father through his voice and sound; that the appellant never asked the complainant who was responsible for her pregnancy even though the pregnancy was clearly visible; that the appellant never raised the alibi defence that he was not at home on the material day when he was arrested; that the appellant’s defence was an afterthought; that PW4 gave contradictory evidence as to the number of days they were away from home; that, while the appellant was being escorted for DNA testing, he escaped from lawful custody only to be re-arrested; that the appellant’s conduct corroborated the evidence that he indeed committed the offence; and that the head teacher (PW2 ), who reported the matter, bore no grudges against the appellant.






13.
The trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and proceeded to convict the appellant and, on 14
th
 October 2019, sentenced him to 30 years’ imprisonment.






14.
Dissatisfied with the learned Magistrate’s decision, the appellant filed an appeal in the High Court of Kenya at Voi in Criminal Appeal No. E051 of 2021 on the grounds that the charge was defective; that the prosecution did not prove its case to the required standard; that he was convicted on the basis of an inconclusive DNA report; and that his alibi defence was not considered.






15.
In its judgment dated 19
th
 October 2022, the High Court found that the appellant did not raise an objection to the charge or contend that it was defective. The court concluded that the appellant was not prejudiced as he participated in the trial in a manner to suggest that he understood the charge, cross-examined witnesses and put an appropriate defence.






16.
Regarding the issue of the DNA report, the court held that that a DNA test was not mandatory, and that failure to adduce such evidence does not of itself weaken the prosecution case. In addition, the first appellate court observed that the proviso to section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 provides that a court can convict an accused person for a sexual offence in a case where the minor is the victim solely on the victim’s evidence as long as the court believes that the minor is speaking the truth. The court found it highly improbable that the complainant could have mistakenly identified her father as the perpetrator, and held that there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was not properly identified.






17.
Regarding the alibi defence, the court concluded that the dates that the appellant claimed to have been away differed from the date of the alleged offence and that, therefore, the alibi defence failed. The court was satisfied that the learned Magistrate properly applied her mind to the law and the evidence, and that she arrived at the correct finding. Accordingly, the court dismissed the appeal and upheld the appellant’s conviction and sentence.






18.
Aggrieved by the decision of Mativo, J., the appellant lodged the instant appeal challenging the High Court decision on the grounds set out in his undated memorandum of appeal styled “Amended Grounds of Appeal,” namely that the learned Judge erred in law: by failing to find that the DNA report did not indicate that the appellant was the father of the appellant’s child after the buccal swab was taken by PW8; by affirming the sentence that was imposed by the trial court, yet it was imposed in mandatory terms without considering the appellant’s mitigation or the unique circumstances of the offence; by failing to find that, at the time of the alleged incident, the appellant was not at home but was at a funeral for 3 days together with his wife (PW4/DW2); by upholding the conviction and sentence on reliance on inconclusive medical evidence; in failing to consider the appellant’s defence and mitigation; and in failing to find that the sentence imposed by the trial court was harsh and excessive, and that it ought to be reviewed. He urged us to allow his appeal.






19.
In support of the appeal, the appellant filed undated written submissions citing the cases of Nzau vs. Republic [2022] KECA 502 (KLR) for the proposition that proof of parentage of the complainant's child cannot be the basis upon which penetration may be proved; re Winship [1970] 397 U.S. 358; and JOO vs. Republic [2015] eKLR, submitting that the standard of proof in criminal cases is that of beyond any reasonable doubt; and the principle that that it is better to acquit ten guilty persons than to convict one innocent person;
Abanga Alias Otango vs. Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 32 of 1990 (UR); and Joan Chebichii Sawe vs. Republic [2003] eKLR, setting out the conditions to be satisfied to draw an inference on guilt based on circumstantial evidence.






20.
The appellant also cited the case of Joseph Ngumbao Nzaro vs. R. [1982] 2 KAR 212 where this Court held that:
“
It is possible for a witness to believe genuinely that he had been attacked by someone he knows very well and yet be mistaken. So the possibility of error or mistake is always there whether the case be of recognition or identification.”






21.
In reply, the respondent filed written submissions and a List of Authorities dated 14
th
 November 2023 and prepared by Mr. Keya Ombele, Principal Prosecution Counsel. Counsel cited the cases of Anjononi & Others vs. Republic (1976-1980) KLR 1566; and Kevin Ochieng Oguta & 3 others vs. Republic [2021] eKLR, highlighting the principle that recognition of an assailant is more satisfactory, more assuring, and more reliable than identification of a stranger because it depends upon the personal knowledge of the assailant in some form or other; KMG vs. Republic [2022] eKLR for the proposition that sentencing is a discretionary act of the trial court; and that the appellate court should not intervene in such an exercise of discretion by a lower court, unless it is demonstrated to it that the trial court has not exercised that discretion properly in that it has failed to consider matters it should have considered, or that it has considered matters it should not have considered, or that looking at the entire decision, it is plainly wrong; and that when the sentence is lawful, the appellate court should not interfere.






22.
Our mandate on a second appeal, as is the one before us, is confined to consideration of matters of law by dint of section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In Karingo vs. Republic [1982] KLR 213, the Court stated:
“
A second appeal must be confined to points of law and this Court will not interfere with concurrent findings of fact arrived at in the two courts below unless based on no evidence.”






23.
Having carefully considered the record of appeal, the impugned judgment, the respective submissions and the law, we find that this appeal stands or falls on our holding on three main issues of law, namely: whether DNA evidence is a pre-requisite ingredient of the offence of defilement or incest; whether the prosecution had proved the charge against the appellant to the required standard; and whether the sentence meted on the appellant and upheld by the first appellate court was harsh or excessive, or otherwise unlawful.






24.
The remaining two grounds of appeal that raise additional issues as to whether the appellant was indeed convicted for incest on the basis of inconclusive evidence; and whether his alibi defence held firm ground to dislodge the prosecution evidence, are purely matters of fact from which this Court is enjoined to steer away on a second appeal. In so far as the two grounds aforesaid raise issues of factual evidence, which we cannot re-open or disturb on 2
nd
 appeal to this Court unless circumstances exist to justify re-consideration and interference therewith. However, we find nothing to suggest that any special circumstances exist to warrant this Court’s interference with the concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below.






25.
The same applies to the additional grounds raised in the appellant’s submissions on second appeal to this Court, and in respect of which it would be remiss of us not to mention albeit to contextualise the appellant’s grievances, namely: that the complainant’s age was not proved as no birth certificate was availed; that the evidence of PW1 seemed to be in consonance with the evidence of DW2 during cross-examination to the effect that the complainant’s age was above 17 years at the time of commission of the offence; that penetration was not proved beyond reasonable doubt; and that pregnancy is not a test or proof of defilement, and that it was a totally different issue.






26.
The foregoing issues of factual evidence raised in the appellant’s submissions likewise fall by the wayside on account of the fact that they cannot be re-opened for re-examination on second appeal. As we have already observed, this Court is obligated to pay homage to the concurrent findings of fact reached by the two courts below in the absence of any special circumstances to justify our interference with those findings.






27.
Turning to the 1
st
 issue as to whether the prosecution was impelled to adduce DNA evidence in proof of the paternity of the complainant’s child in order to sustain the appellant’s conviction for incest, the appellant submitted that examination of the DNA Sample did not link the appellant to the complainant’s baby; that the DNA from the appellant’s buccal swab ought to have been examined to prove that the appellant indeed impregnated the complainant; and that PW8’s allegation that samples can fail to generate DNA profiles depending on preservation and handling processes should be disregarded as the police officers and analyst at the Government Chemist were aware of the precautions to take when receiving the samples.






28.
The respondent’s case was that the DNA report confirmed that the appellant was indeed the complainant’s biological father, which is a necessary ingredient of the offence of incest. On the other hand, DNA evidence of the paternity of her child was not necessary to prove the offence of defilement or incest with which the appellant was charged.






29.
The perennial question as to whether failure to conduct a DNA profile comparison in similar offences invariably dislodges the prosecution’s case has been the subject of numerous judicial pronouncements. In David Kahura Wangari vs. Republic [2016] eKLR, this Court held that:
“
DNA testing or forensic examination of a perpetrator of any offence is done in the course of investigations, but that  is purely the choice of the investigating officers, and failure to do so particularly in this case  did not affect the credibility of the evidence that was before the court.” [Emphasis added]






30.
In the same vein, this Court in Williamson Sowa Mbwanga vs. Republic [2016] eKLR, had this to say:
“
… it is patently clear to us that whilst paternity of PM’s child may prove that the father of the child had defiled PM, that is not the only evidence by which defilement of PM can be proved. The fact, as happens in many cases, that a pregnancy does not result from conduct that would otherwise constitute a sexual offence does not mean that the sexual offence has not been committed. In this case, there does not have to be a pregnancy to prove defilement. A DNA test of the appellant would at most determine whether he was the father of PM’s child, which is a different question from whether the appellant had defiled PM. As the Court of Appeal of Uganda rightly stated, in the sexual offence of defilement, the slightest penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ is sufficient to constitute the offence and that it is not necessary that the hymen be ruptured. (See Twehangane Alfred v. Uganda, CR. APP. No. 139 of 2001).”






31.
On the authority of the afore-cited cases, we agree with counsel for the respondent that failure to conduct a DNA comparison to establish the paternity of the complainant’s child did not of itself affect the credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution in proof of incest beyond reasonable doubt.






32.
We also need to point out right at the outset that the appeal before us was not about the paternity of the complainant’s child, but about the offence of incest perpetrated by her biological father with regard to which the DNA evidence proved that the complainant was indeed the appellant’s daughter. To our mind, the factual evidence led by the prosecution at the trial, and with which the first appellate court concurred, proved the four (4) ingredients of the offence of incest, namely: the age of the victim (as below 18 years); penetration; identification of the accused; and the biological relationship between the accused and the complainant, beyond reasonable doubt, and as required to establish the offence with which the appellant was charged under section 20 of the Act. As this Court has stressed often enough, such concurrent findings of the two courts below cannot be the subject of inquiry on second appeal.






33.
For the avoidance of doubt, section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides that:


20.
Incest by male persons
(1)
Any male person who commits an indecent act or an act which causes penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years: Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.








34.
The appellant’s lamentation that the complainant’s evidence of incest was not corroborated by other evidence finds answer in section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
. The proviso to section 124 dispenses with the need for corroboration of the complainant’s evidence in sexual offences and provides:
124.
Corroboration required in criminal cases. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19 of the 
Oaths and Statutory Declarations Act
 (Cap. 15), where the evidence of the alleged victim is admitted in accordance with that section on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings against any person for an offence, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted on such evidence unless it is corroborated by other material evidence in support thereof implicating him:
Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth.






35.
The decision of the High Court of Kenya at Bomet in Sigei vs. Republic [2022] KEHC 3161 (KLR), citing the Supreme Court of Uganda in Bassita vs. Uganda S.C. Criminal Appeal Number 35 of 1995, cannot escape our attention. As the High Court correctly observed:
“
The act of sexual intercourse or penetration may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Usually, the sexual intercourse is proved by  the victims’ own evidence and corroborated by the medical evidence or other evidence.” (Emphasis added)






36.
With regard to her age, which the appellant challenges on appeal to this Court, and which guides the Court in determining the propriety of the penalty imposed by the trial court and confirmed on first appeal, suffice it to observe that PW1 testified that she was born on 2
nd
 November 1998. PW7 produced a copy of her immunization card confirming her age and date of birth. The complainant was 17 years at the time of the offence, which was not disputed by the appellant at the trial. In Kaingu Elias Kasomo vs. Republic Criminal Appeal No. 504 of 2010 (UR), this Court held that:
“
… the age of the minor is an element of a charge of defilement which ought to be proved by  medical  evidence.  Documents  such  as baptism cards, school leaving certificates in my view would also be useful in this regard.” [Emphasis ours]






37.
Turning to the 3
rd
 issue as to the severity and legality of the sentence meted on the appellant, the appellant submitted that, if he was indeed the perpetrator of the offence charged, the appropriate penalty fell under section 3 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 (the offence of rape); and that, if the prosecution relied on the evidence, the sentence should be passed under section 8(1) as read with section 8(4) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 (defilement of a child between the ages of 16 and 18 years).






38.
To the contrary, the appellant was charged with and convicted for incest under section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, having defiled his biological daughter of 17 years of age. The proviso to section 20(1) of the Act prescribed a sentence of life imprisonment where the victim is under 18 years of age as was the complainant. To our mind, the term of imprisonment for a term of 30 years can only be described as too lenient to deserve reconsideration or interference therewith.






39.
It is not lost to us that sentence is essentially a matter of fact, but to which we find it necessary to pronounce ourselves in so far as it is guided by statute law. For this reason, it may be reconsidered as a matter of mixed law and fact where circumstances exist to require reconsideration on second appeal. We find none, but nonetheless take to mind the principle that the question as to whether the trial court exercised its discretion judiciously in imposing the sentence against the appellant is primarily a question of fact to which this Court’s mandate on second appeal is limited by dint of section 361(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






40.
Addressing itself to the issue of sentence on second appeal in Bernard Kimani Gacheru vs. Republic [2002] eKLR, this Court held that:
“
It is now settled law, following several authorities by this Court and by the High Court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal,  the appellate court will not  easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that  the trial court overlooked some material factor, or  took into account, some wrong material, or acted on a wrong principle. Even if, the Appellate Court feels that the sentence is heavy and that the Appellate Court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone of the matters already stated is shown to exist.” [Emphasis added]






41.
In conclusion, we find it necessary to underscore the circumstances under which this Court may, on second appeal, interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the two courts below. In Adan Muraguri Mungara vs. Republic [2010] eKLR, this Court set out the only circumstances under which it will disturb concurrent findings of fact by the trial court and the first appellate court in the following terms:
“
As this court has often stated, it has a duty to pay homage to concurrent findings of fact made by the two courts below unless such findings are based on no evidence at all or on a perversion of the evidence, or unless on the totality of the evidence, no reasonable tribunal properly directing itself would arrive at such findings. That would mean that the decision is bad in law, thus entitling this Court to interfere.” [Emphasis added]






42.
In conclusion, and on the Authority of the afore-cited case of Adan Muraguri Mungara vs. Republic, we are bound to pay homage to the concurrent findings of fact made by the two courts below in respect of the sufficiency of the evidence on which the appellant was convicted, including evidence of the complainant’s age, recognition of the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence of incest, the father/daughter relationship between the appellant and the complainant as his tenth child, and the evidence of defilement/penetration in all its ingredients; his unfounded defense of alibi; and the severity of the sentence meted on him. In our considered view, we find nothing to suggest that the findings of the two courts below were based on no evidence, or that the decision of the trial court and of the first appellate court were bad in law so as to justify interference therewith.






43.
In view of the foregoing, we reach the inescapable conclusion that the appeal has no merit and is hereby dismissed. Consequently, the Judgment of the High Court of Kenya at Voi (Mativo, J.) delivered on 27
th
 October 2014 in HCCRA No. E051 of 2021 is hereby upheld. Orders accordingly.

Ruling










Introduction


1.
The Applicant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. He was also charged with an alternative charge of the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He was convicted on the main charge and sentenced to eight (8) years imprisonment.






2.
On 3
rd
 March 2022, he filed Notice of Motion application dated 23
rd
 February 2022 seeking a review of his sentence. He prayed for reduction of sentence and/or he be granted a non-custodial sentence.






3.
His Written Submissions were dated 2
nd
 February 2024 and filed on 5
th
 February 2024. The Respondent’s Written Submissions were dated 23
rd
 August 2024 and filed on 27
th
 August 2024. The Ruling herein is based on the said Written Submissions that both parties relied upon in their entirety.








Legal Analysis


4.
The Applicant herein submitted that he was a first offender, aged seventy (70) years old and sickly. He was remorseful of the offence he had committed and pleaded for the leniency of court. He pointed out that he had spent four (4) years in prison and had been transformed and rehabilitated in general character, spiritually and was ready to integrate with his family and the entire community.






5.
He pointed out that he was arrested on 21
st
 August 2013 and sentenced on 3
rd
 February 2020 and thus, spent one (1) month in custody before being granted bond and three (3) months later before sentencing.






6.
He further contended that he had served sufficient term to merit the requirements of punishment and rehabilitation. He invoked Article 50(2)(p) and Article 28 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 and urged the court to reduce his sentence.






7.
On its part, the Respondent submitted that the Applicant herein was sentenced to the most least severe sentence when he was sentenced to ten (10) (sic) years as he ought to have been sentenced to life imprisonment. It was emphatic that the reduction of the said sentence would not be justifiable and/or merited and hence urged this court to dismiss the present application.






8.
As was stated hereinabove, he was charged under Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. Section 8(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides that:-
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.”






9.
The Trial Court was therefore very lenient in the circumstances for having sentenced him to eight (8) years imprisonment instead of the life imprisonment that was prescribed by the law.






10.
Prior to the directions of the Supreme Court in 
Francis Karioko Muruatetu and Another vs Republic [2017] eKLR
 on 6
th
 July 2021 that emphasised that the said case was only applicable to murder cases, courts re-sentenced applicants for different offences, including sexual offences.






11.
This court took cognisance of the fact that there had been emerging jurisprudence that the mandatory minimum sentences in defilement cases was unconstitutional and courts had a discretion to depart from the minimum mandatory sentences.






12.
Notably, in the case of Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs Republic [2022] eKLR, the Court of Appeal reiterated the reasoning in the case of Dismas Wafula Kilwake vs Republic [2018] eKLR where it held that Section 8 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 must be interpreted so as not to take away the discretion of the court in sentencing offences and held that it was impermissible for the legislature to take away the discretion of courts and to compel them to mete out sentences that were disproportionate to what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence.






13.
Bearing in mind that the High Court was bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal as far as sentencing in defilement cases was concerned, this court had been exercising its discretion to reduce the sentences for those who had been sentenced under the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






14.
However, in a decision that was delivered on 12
th
 July 2024, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs Republic (Supra) and stated that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to exercise discretion on sentences that had a mandatory minimum sentence. The Supreme Court directed the relevant organs to abide by its decision noting that the appellant had since been released from prison be apprehended to complete the remainder of his sentence.






15.
As this court was bound by the decisions of courts superior to it, its hands were tied as regards the exercising of its discretion to reduce the Applicant’s sentence. Even without the directions of the Supreme Court of 12
th
 July 2024, it would still not have interfered with the sentence that was meted against the Applicant as it was below the mandatory minimum sentence.






16.
This court struggled with the question of whether or not to enhance the sentence herein in view of the directions of the Supreme Court of 12
th
 July 2024. However, as the Applicant herein did not have the opportunity to elect whether or not to proceed with the application after being duly informed of the risk of proceeding with his said application, the Ruling herein having been reserved before the decision of the Supreme Court on 12
th
 July 2024, this court opted to leave the said sentence against him undisturbed.






17.
Turning to the period that he spent in custody while his trial was ongoing, this court had due regard to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya). The said Section provides that:
“
Subject to the provisions of section 38 of the Penal Code (Cap. 63) every sentence shall be deemed to commence from, and to include the whole of the day of, the date on which it was pronounced, except where otherwise provided in this Code.
Provided that where the person sentenced under subsection (1) has, prior to such sentence, been held in custody, the sentence shall take account of the period spent in custody”
 (Emphasis Court).






18.
This duty is also contained in the Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guidelines where it is provided that: -
“
The proviso to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to take into account the time already served in custody if the convicted person had been in custody during the trial. Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed. In determining the period of imprisonment that should be served by an offender, the court must take into account the period in which the offender was held in custody during the trial.”






19.
The duty to take into account the period an accused person had remained in custody before sentencing pursuant to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was restated by the Court of Appeal in the case of Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs Republic [2018]eKLR.






20.
Although the Applicant indicated that he was arrested on 21
st
 August 2013, the Charge Sheet herein showed that he was arrested on 25
th
 August 2013. He was sentenced on 3
rd
 February 2020.






21.
He did not attend court between 31
st
 October 2017 and 19
th
 November 2019 when it was indicated that he had been arrested. He was then placed in custody until his sentencing on 3
rd
 February 2020.






22.
The Trial Court’s proceedings did not show when he was released on bond, although he indicated that he spent about a month in custody before being released on bond and three (3) months before he was sentenced. He thus spent about three (3) months and fifteen (15) days in custody before he was sentenced.






23.
A reading of the Trial Court’s Sentence showed that it did not take into consideration the time he spent in remand before sentencing. This court was therefore convinced that this was a suitable case for it to exercise its discretion and grant the orders sought.








Disposition


24.
For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Applicant’s Notice of Motion application dated 23
rd
 February 2022 that was filed on 3
rd
 March 2022 was partly merited only with regard to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya).






25.
It is hereby directed that the time the Applicant spent in custody between 25
th
 August 2013 and 25
th
 September 2013 and between 19
th
 November 2019 and 2
nd
 February 2020 be taken into account while computing his sentence as provided in Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya).






26.
It is so ordered.

. He was convicted on the main charge and sentenced to ten (10) years imprisonment.






2.
On 17
th
 August 2023, he filed Notice of Motion application dated 23
rd
 June 2023 seeking a review of his sentence. He prayed that the period of two (2) years and two (2) months that he stayed in custody while the trial was ongoing be taken into account pursuant to Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.






3.
He did not file any written submissions. The Respondent was not opposed to the said application and did not therefore file any written submissions.






Legal Analysis


4.
Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya) provides that:
“
Subject to the provisions of section 38 of the Penal Code (Cap. 63) every sentence shall be deemed to commence from, and to include the whole of the day of, the date on which it was pronounced, except where otherwise provided in this Code.
Provided that where the person sentenced under subsection (1) has, prior to such sentence, been held in custody, the sentence shall take account of the period spent in custody” (Emphasis Court).

7.
The Charge Sheet herein showed that the Petitioner was arrested on 10
th
 February 2021. He was sentenced on 24
th
 April 2023. Although he was granted bond/bail, he did not appear to have come out on bond/bail while his trial was going on. He thus spent two (2) years, two (2) months and fourteen (13) days in custody before he was sentenced.






8.
A reading of the Trial Court’s Sentence showed that it did not take into consideration the time he spent in remand before sentencing. This court was therefore convinced that this was a suitable case for it to exercise its discretion and grant the orders sought.

Ruling










1.
In their Chamber Summons dated 15
th
 April 2024 and filed on 17
th
 April 2024, the Applicants herein sought leave to file an Objection and a Taxation Reference against the assessment of costs that was delivered on 22
nd
 February 2024 in Vihiga PMCC No 9 of 2019 Stephen Okoth Otieno vs Charles Ochieng Achola & 2 Others. They also prayed that the Objection to the Taxing Officer and the Application for Reference annexed to their application herein be deemed as having been duly filed and served upon payment of requisite fees.






2.
When the said application came up for hearing on 4
th
 July 2024, the parties indicated that they would not file Written Submissions but would rely on their respective affidavit evidence. The Ruling herein is therefore based on the said affidavit evidence that they all relied upon in their entirety.






Legal Analysis


3.
The Applicants’ Advocate, Maureen Tesot, swore an Affidavit in support of the said application on behalf of the Applicants herein.






4.
The Applicants averred that on 22
nd
 February 2024, costs in Vihiga PMCC No 9 of 2019 Stephen Okoth Otieno vs Charles Ochieng Achola & 2 Others were assessed at Kshs 224,393/= and a Decree and Certificate of Costs issued. It was their averment that they only became aware of the taxed costs when the Respondent’s counsel served them with a letter dated 23
rd
 February 2024 demanding for payment of the judgment sum and the assessed costs.






5.
They contended that their Advocates engaged the Respondent’s counsel on post-assessment negotiations considering that they were not invited for taxation but that the negotiations collapsed.






6.
They pointed out that they were aggrieved and dissatisfied with the costs assessed on 22
nd
 February 2024 and hence were seeking the court’s leave to file Notice of Objection and a Reference out of time as they were unable to file the same within fourteen (14) days specified under Section 11(1) and (2) of the Advocates Remuneration Order, 2014.






7.
The Respondent’s Advocate, Stanley N. Kagunza, swore a Replying Affidavit on 28
th
 May 2024 on behalf of the Respondent herein. The file copy did not bear a court stamp so it was not possible to ascertain when the same was filed.






8.
The Respondent asserted that the Applicants’ application was not urgent in anyway. She termed it as an afterthought, misadvised, baseless, frivolous, scandalous, misconceived, lacked merit and was an abuse of the court’s process as the same did not disclose any reasonable legal and/or factual grounds to warrant this court to grant the prayers sought. She added that the same was incompetent, a non-starter, dead on arrival and should be dismissed and/or struck out in the first instance.






9.
She contended that as the Taxing Master’s Ruling was delivered on 22
nd
 February 2024, the Applicants ought to have filed the reference before the expiry of fourteen (14) days in accordance with the procedure that was set out in Paragraph 11 of the Advocates’ Remuneration Order. She stated that they had not demonstrated any good and sufficient cause or given a satisfactory explanation of the period of delay in not having filed the reference within time as set out in Paragraph 11(1) and (2) of the Remuneration Order.






10.
She stated that the Applicants only got interested in the case after warrants of attachments were issued against them. She pointed out that they had approached the court with unclean hands and had failed to disclose material facts.






11.
She asserted that the application had been brought in utmost bad faith and they were culpable of indolence as they were authors of their own misfortune. It was her averment that the present application did not meet the threshold of the granting of the orders that had been sought herein but was only an approbation and reprobation intended to frustrate the realisation of the impugned taxed costs and/or her fruits of litigation.






12.
She contended that it was in the interest of justice that the case be brought to finality and that allowing the application would delay the same and the unwarranted orders cause her prejudice. She urged the court to dismiss the Applicants’ application for being untenable in law.






13.
Paragraph 11(1) and (2) of the Advocates Remuneration Order provides as follows:-
1.
Should any party object to the decision of the taxing officer, he may within fourteen days after the decision give notice in writing to the taxing officer of the items of taxation to which he objects.
2.
The taxing officer shall forthwith record and forward to the objector the reasons for his decision on those items and the objector may within fourteen days from the receipt of the reasons apply to a judge by chamber summons, which shall be served on all the parties concerned, setting out the grounds of his objection.”






14.
Indeed, in exercising its discretion to allow an application seeking extension to file a reference out of time, a court had to be satisfied that the omission to file the same within time was excusable. In other words, there had to be a plausible explanation for the delay in filing the reference.






15.
It was apparent from the court record that the Ruling the Applicants intended to appeal against was delivered on 22
nd
 February 2024. The present application was filed on 17
th
 April 2024. About one (1) month and twenty-six (26) days had since passed. This was not an inordinately long period.






16.
Going further, the Applicants pointed out that there were not invited for taxation, a fact that was not rebutted by the Respondent. Be that as it may, the impugned proceedings of 22
nd
 February 2024 were not annexed herein to enable this court determine the said facts.






17.
Having said so, every party has a right to access any court or tribunal to have its dispute heard and determined in accordance with Article 50(1) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010. Even where a party delays in doing an act, there is always a provision that would give it reprieve to seek justice.






18.
Notably, Order 50 Rule 6 of Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 empowers the court to enlarge the time to do a particular act. The said Order 50 Rule 6 of Civil Procedure Rules stipulates as follows:-
“
Where a limited time has been fixed for doing any act or taking any proceedings under these Rules, or by summary notice or by order of the court, the court shall have power to enlarge such time upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require, and such enlargement may be ordered although the application for the same is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed:
Provided that the costs of any application to extend such time and of any order made thereon shall be borne by the parties making such application, unless the court orders otherwise”.






19.
Against this backdrop, this court therefore perused the Applicants’ application but did not see the Notice of Objection and the Reference they had claimed to have annexed. Be that as it may, it was not upon its duty to consider the merits or otherwise of the Notice of Objection and the Reference as that was strictly under the purview of the court that was to hear and determine the reference. All that it was expected to do at this stage was to consider if the Applicant herein had demonstrated that he had arguable grounds of appeal as against the impugned Ruling.






20.
While considering whether or not to grant an order for extension to do any act, the court was also required to consider if the opposing side would suffer any prejudice if extension of time was granted. This court did not see any prejudice that the Respondent would suffer or was likely to suffer if the Applicants herein exercised their constitutional right of appeal. If there was any prejudice, then she did not demonstrate the same.






21.
Taking all the factors hereinabove into account, it was the considered view of this court that that it was in the interests of justice (emphasis court) that the Applicants be given an opportunity to have their Reference heard on merit as they would suffer prejudice if they were denied an opportunity to fully present their Reference to be heard on merit.






22.
Indeed, the power to grant orders in the interest of justice and/or for the ends of justice (emphasis court) is well captured in Section 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 that states that: -
“
Nothing in the Act shall limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice (emphasis court) or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.”








Disposition


23.
For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Applicants’ Chamber Summons application dated 15
th
 April 2024 and filed on 17
th
 April 2024 was merited and the same be and is hereby allowed in terms of Prayer No (3) and (4) therein on the following conditions: -
1.
That the Applicants be and are hereby granted leave to file a Reference against the decision of the Taxing Master of 22
nd
 February 2024.
2.
That the Applicants be and are hereby directed to file and serve their Notice of Objection within fourteen (14) days from the date of this Ruling.
3.
That the Applicants be and are hereby directed to file and serve their Reference within fourteen (14) days after the Taxing Officer forwards to them the reasons for her decision.
4.
That in the event the Applicant fails to comply with Paragraph 
23
(2) and (3), the Respondent will be at liberty to commence legal proceedings for recovery of the taxed costs.
5.
That this matter will be mentioned on 5
th
 December 2024 to confirm compliance of the order in Paragraph 
23
 (2) and (3) hereinabove and/or for further orders and/or directions.
5. Costs of the application herein will be in the cause.

Respondent







        
          (Being an Appeal from the Judgment of Hon M. Ochieng (SPM) delivered at Hamisi in Senior Principal Magistrate’s Court in Sexual Offence Case No 50 of 2021 on 20th February 2023)
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
The Appellant herein was charged with the offence of defilement contrary to Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. He was also charged with an alternative charge of the offence of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






2.
He was convicted by the Learned Trial Magistrate, Hon M. Ochieng (SPM), on the charge of defilement and sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment.






3.
Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment, on 4
th
 March 2023, he lodged the Appeal herein. His Petition of Appeal was dated 3
rd
 March 2023.






4.
His Written Submissions were dated 20
th
 March 2024 and filed on 12
th
 April 2024 while those of the Respondent were dated 21
st
 May 2024. It was not clear from the court record when the same were filed as they did not bear the court stamp). The Judgment herein is based on the said Written Submissions that both parties relied upon in their entirety.








Legal Analysis


5.
It is settled law that the duty of a first appellate court is to evaluate afresh the evidence adduced before the trial court in order to arrive at its own independent conclusion but bearing in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify.






6.
This was aptly stated in the case of Selle & Another vs Associated Motor Boat Co Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123 where the court therein held that the appellate court was not bound by the findings of fact of the trial court but that in re-considering and re-evaluating the evidence so as to draw its own conclusions, it always had to bear in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify and thus make due allowance in that respect.






7.
Having looked at the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal, it appeared to this court that the issues that had been placed before it for determination were as follows:-
a.
Whether or not the Prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt; and
b.
Whether or not in the circumstances of this case, the sentence that was meted upon the Appellant herein by the Trial Court was lawful and/or warranted.






8.
The court dealt with the said issues under the following distinct and separate heads.






I. Proof Of Prosecution’s Case


9.
Grounds of Appeal Nos (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) of the Petition of Appeal were dealt with under this head as they were all related.






10.
In determining whether or not the Prosecution had proved its case to the required standard, which in criminal cases is proof beyond reasonable doubt, this court considered the ingredients of the offence of defilement.






11.
It is now settled that the ingredients of the offence of defilement are proof of complainant’s age, proof of penetration and identification of the perpetrator as was held in the case of George Opondo Olunga vs Republic [2016] eKLR.






12.
This court dealt with the aforesaid Grounds of Appeal under the following distinct and separate heads.








A. Age


13.
The Appellant did not submit on this issue. On its part, the Respondent pointed out that Jackline Bulimu Vinayo (hereinafter referred to as “PW 2”) testified that her daughter, the Complainant, PM, (hereinafter referred to as “PW 1”) was born on 3
rd
 November 2007. She produced a Birth Certificate in support thereof.






14.
The aforementioned Birth Certificate showed that PW 1 was born on 3
rd
 November 2007. The offence herein was committed between 9
th
 August 2021 and 10
th
 August 2021. She was therefore aged thirteen (13) years nine (9) months at the material time of the incident herein.






15.
The Appellant did not challenge the production of the aforesaid Birth Certificate and/or rebut this evidence by adducing evidence to the contrary. Consequently, this court was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved that PW 1 was thirteen (13) years, nine (9) months old and was therefore a child at the material time.








B. Identification


16.
The Appellant blamed the Trial Court for failing to weigh the Prosecution’s conflicting evidence that was inconsequential to his conviction. He pointed out that the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 was inconsistent. He argued that although they both indicated that they knew he worked only one house from their home, PW 1 stated in her testimony that she did not know his place of work. He challenged the fact that PW 1 led the Assistant Chief to his work place yet she did not know where he worked. He also pointed out that Beatrice Alivitsa (hereinafter referred to as “DW 2”) denied telling PW 1, PW 2 and the Assistant Chief that there was a worker in her home who had slept with PW 1 in the kitchen and that DW 2 denied witnessing his arrest as PW 1 and PW 2 had both alleged.






17.
He further averred that the Trial Court failed to consider the evidence of the surrounding circumstances in order to ascertain if he committed the offence pursuant to Section 33 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No 3 of 2006. He argued that there were co-existing circumstances that showed that PW 1 must have slept at the house of Gwihila, her long-term boyfriend and he defiled her but she had framed him to shield the said Gwihila from the predicament.






18.
He asserted that Prosecution’s evidence that he locked up PW 1 in the kitchen from 6.00 pm was not credible as there were around four (4) people and a bee hive of activities going on at the said time yet none of the people saw him.






19.
On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that PW 1 testified that the incident happened at 6.00pm and that she was able to identify the Appellant and the house she slept in on the material date. It added that she was able to take PW 2 and the Assistant Chief to the said house where the Appellant was found locking the door and was arrested. It further contended that PW 1 positively identified the Appellant by pointing at him and stated that he was her neighbour.






20.
It further submitted that PW 2 also indicated that she knew the Appellant as they were neighbours and that she could not have been mistaken as to his identity. It pointed out that that was evidence of recognition which was more reliable and weighty than that of identification of a stranger.






21.
In this regard, it relied on the case of Anjononi & Others vs Republic (1976-80) 1 KLR 1566 where it was held that recognition of an assailant was more satisfactory, more assuring and more reliable than identification of a stranger because it depended upon the personal knowledge of the assailant in some form or other.






22.
It asserted that the Appellant’s argument that PW 1 did not know his work place was irrelevant and did not relate to the material facts of the matter. It pointed out that the Trial Court properly addressed its mind to the issues he had raised and it found PW 1’s evidence to have been credible and consistent. It added that the Trial Court relied on Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 which gave the exception to corroboration in sexual offence cases of a minor.






23.
On the issue of contradictions, it placed reliance on the case of MTG vs Republic (citation not given) where it was held that minor or trivial contradictions did not affect the credibility of a witness and could not vitiate a trial. It further submitted that the Trial Court clearly noted that although PW 1 was a minor, the fact that she had previous sexual encounter with other persons did not discredit her as a witness and that the argument that she had slept with one Gwihila and was only framing the Appellant was immaterial.






24.
It further submitted that the Appellant’s submission that DW 2 would have seen PW 1 in her kitchen was false as during her re-examination, she stated that if the Appellant had someone in the house she would not have known.






25.
PW 1 testified that on the material date of 9
th
 August 2021, at around 6.00pm, she had gone to borrow a book from her friend, Jemima, when she met the Appellant. He held her hand, pulled her into his house where he worked, undressed her and then defiled her. Her evidence was that she wanted to go home but he told her that she could in the morning. In the morning, he escorted her to the tea bushes where a woman found her and took her to the sub-chief. PW 2’s evidence corroborated her evidence.






26.
This court noted that PW 1 was the only identifying witness. Having said so, under Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 Cap 80 (Laws of Kenya), a trial court could convict a person on the basis of uncorroborated evidence of the victim if it was satisfied that the victim was telling the truth.






27.
Notably, the proviso of Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
 states that:-
“
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19 of the 
Oaths and Statutory Declarations Act
 (Cap. 15), where the evidence of the alleged victim is admitted in accordance with that section on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings against any person for an offence, the accused shall not be liable to be convicted on such evidence unless it is corroborated by other material evidence in support thereof implicating him:
Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth
 (emphasis).”






28.
Even so, a trial court was required to exercise great caution before relying on the evidence of a single witness to convict an accused person as it would be one person’s word against the other. Other corroborating evidence could assist the trial or appellate court to come with a determination as to who between the opposing witnesses was being truthful. Other corroborating evidence could be proof of penetration, which was dealt with later in the Judgment herein.






29.
The incident took place at day time. PW 1 and the Appellant knew each other as they were neighbours. In his sworn evidence, he also confirmed that he knew her as his neighbour. There could not therefore have been any possibility of a mistaken identity because they were not strangers as they also spent considerable time in his house. PW 1 positively identified him by pointing at him in the dock during trial. It was immaterial that she did not know his place of work. Her assertion that he pulled her into his place of work was inconsequential and immaterial as she continued to refer to his house and not his place of work as the place where he defiled her.






30.
This court thus came to the firm conclusion that the Prosecution proved the ingredient of identification which was by recognition.








C. Penetration


31.
The Appellant did not clearly submit on this issue. On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that under normal circumstances, victims of sexual offences were the only witnesses. However, it invoked Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 and contended that the evidence of PW 1 and that of the Clinical Officer, Douglas Obare (hereinafter referred to as “PW 3”) proved the ingredient of penetration.






32.
According to PW 1, on the material day, while at her friend’s home, the Appellant touched her private parts and inserted his penis into her private parts.






33.
PW 3 confirmed that PW 1 was in good general condition with no physical injuries. However, her hymen was not intact and that she had thick whitish discharge with proteins and pus cells on urine. He concluded that there was probable vaginal penetration. He produced the Post Rape Care (PRC) Form, P3 Form and Treatment notes as exhibits in support of the Prosecution’s case.






34.
Notably, PW 1’s evidence was well corroborated by the oral evidence of PW 2 and the Investigating Officer, No 92118 Corporal Lucy Chanzu (hereinafter referred to as “PW 4”) and by the scientific evidence that was tendered by PW 3 which confirmed recent penetration.






35.
The Appellant’s defence was simply a denial as he testified that he was framed. His two (2) witnesses, DW 2 and June Musimbi (hereinafter referred to as “DW 3”) were not eye witnesses and therefore their evidence was not watertight enough to displace the Prosecution’s inference of guilt on his part.






36.
The Trial Court could not therefore have been faulted for having found that he did in fact penetrate PW 1 and that the Prosecution had proved its case against him beyond reasonable doubt.






37.
In the premises foregoing, Grounds of Appeal Nos (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) of the Petition of Appeal were not merited and the same be and are hereby dismissed.








II. Sentencing


38.
This court noted that the Appellant did not include a ground of appeal with regard to his sentence. He, however, submitted on the same. However, to save the court’s time, this court considered the legality or otherwise of his sentence pursuant to Article 159(2)(d) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 which mandates courts to administer justice without undue regard to procedural technicalities.






39.
He placed reliance on the case of Martin Charo vs Republic [2016] eKLR where it was held that it was unfair to impose twenty (20) years imprisonment on a sexual offender when the complainant was enjoying the relationship. In this regard, he pointed out that PW 1 had a coloured history of sex with several people and that her conduct needed to be considered in the case of defilement. He thus urged the court to consider a least prescribed sentence preferably time already served.






40.
On its part, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant’s sentence was lawful and should be upheld.






41.
The Appellant herein was sentenced under Section 8(3) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The same provides as follows: -
“
A person who commits an offence of defilement with a child between the age of twelve and fifteen years is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty years”






42.
This court could not therefore fault the Trial Court for having sentenced him to twenty (20) years imprisonment as that was lawful. It was immaterial that PW 1 was sexually active. He was the one who was caught having sex with her and therefore had to carry his own cross.






43.
Prior to the directions of the Supreme Court in 
Francis Karioko Muruatetu and Another vs Republic [2017] eKLR
 on 6
th
 July 2021 that emphasised that the said case was only applicable to murder cases, courts re-sentenced applicants for different offences, including sexual offences.






44.
Notably, in the case of Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs Republic [2022] eKLR, the Court of Appeal reiterated the reasoning in the case of Dismas Wafula Kilwake vs Republic [2018] eKLR where it held that Section 8 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 must be interpreted so as not to take away the discretion of the court in sentencing offences and held that it was impermissible for the legislature to take away the discretion of courts and to compel them to mete out sentences that were disproportionate to what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence.






45.
Bearing in mind that the High Court was bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal as far as sentencing in defilement cases was concerned, this court had been exercising its discretion to reduce the sentences for those who had been sentenced under the 
Sexual Offences Act
.






46.
However, in a decision that was delivered on 12
th
 July 2024, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case Joshua Gichuki Mwangi vs Republic (Supra) and stated that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to exercise discretion on sentences that had a mandatory minimum sentence. The Supreme Court directed the relevant organs to abide by its decision noting that the appellant therein had since been released from prison.






47.
As this court was bound by the decisions of courts superior to it, its hands were tied as regards the exercising of its discretion to reduce the Appellant’s sentence. It had no option but to leave the said sentence that was meted against the Appellant herein undisturbed.






48.
Going further, this court was mandated to consider the period he spent in remand while his trial was on going as provided in Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya).






49.
The said Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that:-
“
Subject to the provisions of section 38 of the Penal Code (cap 63) every sentence shall be deemed to commence from, and to include the whole of the day of, the date on which it was pronounced, except where otherwise provided in this Code
Provided that where the person sentenced under subsection (1) has, prior to such sentence, been held in custody, the 
sentence shall take account of the period spent in custody”
 (emphasis court).






50.
Further, the Judiciary Sentencing Policy Guidelines provide that:-
“
The proviso to section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code obligates the court to take into account the time already served in custody if the convicted person had been in custody during the trial. Failure to do so impacts on the overall period of detention which may result in an excessive punishment that is not proportional to the offence committed. In determining the period of imprisonment that should be served by an offender, the court must take into account the period in which the offender was held in custody during the trial.”






51.
The requirement under Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was restated by the Court of Appeal in Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another vs Republic [2018] eKLR.






52.
The Appellant was arrested on 10
th
 August 2021. He was released on bond on 19
th
 August 2021. He therefore spent nine (9) days in custody before his conviction. This period therefore ought to be taken into consideration while computing his sentence.








III. Validity Or Otherwise Of The Judgment


53.
The Appellant had further pointed out that the Trial Court delivered its Judgment outside the mandatory statutory period as provided by law. The Respondent did not submit on this issue.






54.
On 1
st
 November 2022, the Trial Court reserved its Judgment for 27
th
 January 2023. However, the decision was delivered on 20
th
 February 2023.






55.
Unlike under Order 21 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 2010 where judgments are to be delivered either at once or within sixty (60) days from the conclusion of the trial notice of which shall be given to the parties or their advocates or at a later date, the Criminal Procedure Code did not specifically set out the timelines within which judgments should be delivered.






56.
Assuming that the judgment was delivered outside any times, the Appellant did not suffer any prejudice. If he did, then he did not demonstrate the same. This court thus came to the firm conclusion that the Trial Court’s delay in rendering a decision was not fatal and did not dislodge the Appellant’s guilt in the commission of the offence herein.










Disposition


57.
For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Appellant’s Petition of Appeal dated 3
rd
 March 2023 and lodged on 4
th
 March 2023 was not merited and the same be and is hereby dismissed. His conviction and sentence be and are hereby upheld as they were both safe.






58.
However, for the avoidance of doubt, the period between 10
th
 August 2021 and 19
th
 August 2021 be and is hereby taken into account while computing his sentence in line with Section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 75 (Laws of Kenya).






59.
It is so ordered.

She averred that following the filing of the suit by the plaintiffs herein, she wrote to the parties on 21
st
 May, 2024 informing them that she has submitted to this Court’s jurisdiction and suspended the earlier directions issued on 3
rd
 May, 2024, pending determination of the dispute by the Court.






Plaintiffs’ submissions


13.
The plaintiffs filed written submissions dated 22
nd
 May, 2024. Mr. Abdiaziz, learned Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the three main principles to be considered in order for conservatory orders to be granted are that an applicant must demonstrate that he has a prima facie case with a likelihood of success and that unless the Court grants a conservatory order, there is real danger that he will suffer prejudice as a result of the violation or threatened violation of 
the Constitution
, that if a conservatory order is not granted, the petition alleging violation of, or threat of violation of rights will be rendered nugatory, and that public interest must be considered before grant of a conservatory order.






14.
Counsel stated that the plaintiffs are the elected officials of Phase II Diamond Estate, having been elected into office on 13
th
 April, 2024 when the members of the Association and the residents of the Estate convened a meeting to elect new leaders. He contended that the defendants had clung onto leadership of the Association since the year 2021, and had been ruling with an iron fist since then. He further contended that the residents of the Estate, who are members of the Association got fed up and with the mis-management and harassment by the defendants and decided to elect new officials who are the plaintiffs herein.






15.
He submitted that the plaintiffs are deserving of conservatory orders as the application and plaint establish a prima facie case with a probability of success, and that failure to grant them orders at this stage will render the substratum of the main suit nugatory. He also submitted that the plaintiffs will suffer prejudice as a result of violations by the defendants, and that it is in the interest of the residents of the entire Estate that the defendants/respondents be restrained from managing and handling the affairs of Phase II Diamond Estate.






16.
Counsel cited Nairobi Civil Appeal No. 151 of 2011 Invesco Assurance Co. Ltd v MW (minor suing thro’ next friend and mother (HW) [2016] eKLR eKLR, and Judicial Service Commission v Speaker of the National Assembly & another [2013] eKLR, on the definition of conservatory orders.






17.
From the above authorities, Mr. Abdiaziz stated that the conservatory orders being prayed for are aimed at preserving the substratum of the matter pending the hearing of the main issues in dispute, such matters being the affairs, monies and management of the Estate, pending determination of the suit filed herein.






18.
Counsel submitted that granting of a temporary injunction under Order 40 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 is a matter of judicial discretion, after the Court has considered the facts and applied them to the principles under Order 40 Rule 1(b) of the said Rules. He stated that the plaintiffs herein have proved that the defendants intend to cart away the Association’s money held in trust for the residents of Phase II Diamond Estate, domiciled in Absa Bank Queensway Branch, Account No. 2045186159, registered in the name of Phase II Diamond Estate Association, without lawful justification.






19.
Mr. Abdiaziz relied on the case of Giella v Cassman & Co. Ltd (1973) EA, where the Court outlined the general principles applicable where an order for an injunction is sought. He also relied on the case of Mrao Limited v First American Bank Kenya Ltd Civil Appeal No. 39 of 2002 cited in the case of Bulk Medicals Ltd v Paramount Universal Bank Ltd & 2 others [2006] eKLR, where the Court echoed the legal position that in order to establish a prima facie case, all that a party is required to demonstrate is the infringement of a right and the probability of the success of the applicant’s case at trial. Counsel relied on the Concise Oxford Dictionary of current English, 8
th
 Edition p. 950, for the definition of the word “probability”.






20.
Counsel submitted that the plaintiffs have surpassed the first test for being granted an injunction on the grounds that the defendants have been officials of the Association since the year 2021 and have been misappropriating funds contributed by the residents of the Estate and have been engaging in mismanaging the Estate’s affairs, that they have limited the rights of the children to play outside, and that they have limited their playground space in the Estate, that they have forcefully closed and evicted owners of the Estate’s shops against the wishes of the residents.






21.
Other allegations leveled against the defendants are that there has been lack of transparency in the running of the affairs of the Estate with no AGM being called by the defendants and that there have been no elections, non-provision of financial reports to Estate residents for the past five (5) years and embezzlement of the Estate’s collections.






22.
Counsel stated that the plaintiffs have also alleged that the defendants have been illegally levying letting fees on the homeowners without any justification or authority from the residents, and that they have engaged in conflict of interest by providing security and garbage collection services to Estate residents, such as, by the outgoing Secretary venturing into the business of security guards. That without competition, he awarded himself the security tender for the Estate and that he has been charging high fees. The plaintiffs’ Counsel urged this Court to stop the defendants in their tracks before they ruin the Association and the entire Estate in general.






23.
He submitted that a party seeking interlocutory orders is required to satisfy the first and second requirements, and it is only when the Court is in doubt that it considers the third aspect. He urged this Court to find that the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the plaintiffs. He relied on the case of Jan Bonde Nielsen v Herman Philipus Steyn also known as Hermannus Phillipus Steyn & 2 others [2012] eKLR, where the Court held that it was not strictly bound by the three principles in Giella v Cassman Brown & Co Ltd (supra), as a Court could also look at the circumstances of the case generally and the overriding objective of the law.






24.
He also relied on the case of Suleiman v Amboseli Resort (2004) 2 KLR 589, where Ojwang Ag. J (as he then was), stated that even as the principles in Giella v Cassman Brown & Co Ltd (supra) remain the basic test, it was worth adopting a further, more intrinsic test which is in the nature of a general principle, in that the Court in responding to the prayers for interlocutory injunctive relief, should always opt for the lower rather than the higher risk of injustice.






25.
Mr. Abdiaziz contended that it was not true that the defendants are the bona fide elected members (sic) of the Association having been elected on 20
th
 January, 2024 as they claim in their replying affidavit. He stated that the defendants want to fraudulently and arbitrarily cling onto the leadership of the Association with ulterior motives and not with the intention of properly managing the Estate. Counsel pointed to the fact that only the Chairman of the Association was changed in the impugned elections, which raises questions of authenticity of the said elections.






26.
He prayed for the orders sought in the plaintiffs’ application to be granted as the plaintiffs stand to suffer immense prejudice and damage that cannot be compensated by an award of damages or costs.








Defendants’ submissions


27.
Mr. Tugee, learned Counsel for the defendants stated that the dispute herein relates to the management of the affairs of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road Nairobi (Society), duly registered under the 
Societies Act
 and issued with certificate Registration No. R54042. He also stated that the membership of the Society is mainly drawn from the residents of Phase II Diamond Estate Likoni Road Nairobi.






28.
Counsel stated that since its registration, the Society’s affairs have been conducted in line with its Constitution, with management of its affairs being conducted by its registered officials who are the defendants herein. He further stated that upon expiry of their initial term, the Society’s officials organized an election in line with the Rules of the Society’s Constitution in a meeting held on 20
th
 January, 2024, whereby most of the defendants were re-elected into office with the exception of the 1
st
 defendant, who was replaced as the Chairman by Abdiweli Adan Kalicha, and that they thereafter proceeded to file the requisite returns with the Registrar of Societies.






29.
He stated that in the application of 2
nd
 May, 2024, the plaintiffs allege to be the officials of the Society, and allege to have been elected as the officials of the Society in a meeting of the Estate held on 13
th
 April, 2024, and are seeking various orders to be granted. They also seek to take control the affairs of the Society including the management of bank accounts.






30.
Counsel pointed out that this Court granted an order to restrain the defendants from managing the affairs of the Society and in their place, for the plaintiffs to take control of the Society’s affairs. That being aggrieved by the said orders, the defendants filed an application dated 9
th
 May, 2024 seeking inter alia orders for setting aside the exparte orders granted to the plaintiffs on 7
th
 May, 2024.






31.
Mr. Tugee stated that the crux of the defendants’ argument is that the plaintiffs, who are merely residents of the Estate and not members of the Society, are misleading this Court to orchestrate a coup and impose the plaintiffs, who are strangers to the Society, to take over the affairs of Society to the detriment of its rightful members and officials, and the defendants.






32.
Counsel for the defendants contended that this Court does not have the jurisdiction to determine the application by the plaintiffs as under the 
Societies Act
, it is the Registrar of Societies who has the power and jurisdiction in the first instance, to hear and determine disputes relating to Societies registered under the Act. He stated that Section 18 of the Act sets out the procedure to be followed. He termed the current suit and application a blatant disregard of the laid down procedure.






33.
Counsel further stated that by the time that the plaintiffs were making the instant application, the Registrar was already seized of the matter, and on 3
rd
 May, 2024, the Registrar in exercise of her statutory mandate wrote to the parties making her determination of the matter and directing the defendants who are the bonafide officials on record to inter alia, convene an Annual General Meeting for the purposes of an election of office bearers of the Association within 45 days of the date of her letter.






34.
Mr. Tugee submitted that the Registrar is still seized of the matter, and that in law, she is the one who currently has the administrative jurisdiction and statutory mandate to hear and determine all aspects of the current dispute. He argued that the application filed by the plaintiffs goes against the legal principles of exhaustion of other remedies and the doctrine of ripeness. On the latter principle, Counsel stated that the plaintiffs’ application as conceived and presented is premature as the Registrar has not rendered a final decision on the matter.






35.
Counsel contended that the exparte orders granted on 7
th
 May, 2024 are contrary to Article 10 of 
the Constitution
 which binds this Court to bear in mind principles of the rule of law, good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability; which principles would be thwarted if this Court seeks to exercise and/or take jurisdiction reserved for another entity or office under the law, which in this case, is the Registrar of Societies.






36.
Mr. Tugee relied on the case of Islamia Madrassa Society v Zafar Niaz & 8 others [2021] eKLR, where the Court found that the laid down procedure in resolving an impasse on who the officials of the Society therein were, was set out in Section 18 of the 
Societies Act
, which should have been adhered to. The Court therein also found that the action by the plaintiff in filing the suit when it lacked capacity to do so, was a short cut.






37.
Mr. Tugee stated that plaintiffs had not proffered an appeal against the Registrar’s decision rendered on 3
rd
 May, 2024, and that they failed to disclose the said decision even though they filed the suit and the application three (3) days after the Registrar’s decision. He submitted that an appeal is the only avenue provided by law to challenge the Registrar’s decision, and as such, the plaintiffs are estopped from commencing and/or continuing the current suit guised as a commercial dispute and obtaining orders from the Court through their interlocutory application.






38.
On the issue of whether the plaintiffs have the locus standi to bring the proceedings herein, for and on behalf of the Society, Mr. Tugee stated that the plaintiffs are not elected officials of the Society and that they are acting contrary to the interests of the Society, and have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that they are newly elected as alleged or at all. He further stated that the validly elected officials of the Society have already raised the issue with the plaintiffs’ documentation that was presented before the Registrar, which has been used to obtain the current conservatory reliefs as falsified, forged, and obtained fraudulently.






39.
Mr. Tugee contended that the deposition by Abdirizack Bishar Aress that he is the Chairman of the applicant Society as per paragraph 2 of the supporting affidavit filed by the plaintiffs, and based on which the exparte orders of 7
th
 May, 2024 were granted, is false and amounts to perjury.






40.
Counsel submitted that the affairs of the Society including its operations, management, meetings, leadership are governed by 
the Constitution
 of the Society which was adopted by the members in the initial meeting of 1
st
 August, 2021. He contended that the plaintiffs herein have never been members of the Society and as such, they do not qualify to be officials of the Society. He referred to Rule 3(a) of the Society’s Constitution which provides that any person over the age of 18 who is a resident of Phase II Diamond Park Estate shall be eligible for membership of the Society, subject to the approval of the Committee, upon which one becomes a member, but the plaintiffs only allege to be residents of Phase II Diamond Park Estate and have never officially applied for membership of the Society.






41.
He stated that the plaintiffs allege to reside in Phase II Diamond Park Estate, but residing in an Estate ought not be confused with membership of the Society, as membership of a Society is through subscription and not through being a resident of an Estate. He indicated that the plaintiffs have not even attempted to prove their membership in the Society, yet they seek to manage the affairs of a Society to which they do not belong.






42.
As to the meeting purportedly held on 13
th
 April, 2024, in which the plaintiffs claim to have been elected as officials, Mr. Tugee stated that the purported elections of 13
th
 April, 2024 were not held, and the minutes and resolutions produced by the plaintiffs were made up. He submitted that the defendants have produced sworn affidavits from numerous residents who have expressly stated that they never attended the said meeting, and that their names were included without their permission, and with an intention to mislead the Court.






43.
Mr. Tugee challenged the minutes of the meeting of 13
th
 April, 2024, that refer to an entity known as Diamond Park 2. He stated that the resolution arising from the said meeting indicates that an alternative Association with the name Diamond Park 2 Residents Association was to be registered. He contended that the Diamond Park 2 is a stranger to Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road Nairobi.






44.
He submitted that the said meeting was in contravention of the prescribed procedure for meetings of the Society for reasons that, pursuant to Rule 8(d) of 
the Constitution
 of the Society, a Special General Meeting of the Society can only be held after a request in writing to the Secretary by not less than a third of the members, which was not adhered to, and such evidence has not been exhibited by the plaintiffs.






45.
He added that under Rule 9 of 
the Constitution
 of the Society, only the Chairperson or in his absence, the Vice-Chairperson is allowed to chair the meetings of the Society, but both the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson were part of the plaintiffs’ meeting of 13
th
 April, 2024.






46.
He submitted that from the foregoing, the defendants had demonstrated that the plaintiffs were never validly elected as officials of the Society and most importantly, have never been members of the Society, and do not possess the requisite locus standi to institute a suit or make the instant application on behalf of the Society.






47.
The defendants contended that in obtaining the exparte orders of 7
th
 May, 2024, there was deliberate non-disclosure of material facts, and for that reason, the said orders should be discharged. Mr. Tugee relied on the case of Aga Khan Foundation Services Kenya v Republic & others [2004] 1 EA 1, to the effect that exparte orders are in their nature provisional and can be set aside either by the Judge who granted them or by another Judge, should the Judge who granted them not be available for any reason.






48.
In expounding on the issue of non-disclosure of material facts, Mr. Tugee submitted that the plaintiffs have in their suit and application withheld that the matter of the Society’s officials is pending resolution before the Registrar of Societies (Registrar). That they appeared and made representations before the said Registrar on 2
nd
 May, 2024, which are principally the same grievance presented before this Court, and that the Registrar has already made a determination on the matter, which is binding on the plaintiffs, unless challenged on appeal.






49.
Counsel submitted that the plaintiffs did not disclose that there was a pending matter before the Environment and Land Court, being ELCL/E136 of 2024; Phase II Diamond Estate Association versus Regnoil Oil Kenya Limited, which is related to the current proceedings. He stated that the said case relates to the attempted grabbing of public land by Regnoil Oil Kenya Ltd, whose principal Shareholder Mohamed Khalif Ali is the father of the 3
rd
 plaintiff herein, Sulekha Mohamed Khalif, who is being used together with others, to unprocedurally take over the Society in order to compromise the proceedings in the said ELC case.






50.
Mr. Tugee stated that contrary to the plaitntiff’s submissions, failure to disclose the ELC case to this Court is a significant material non-disclosure given the clear nexus between the present case and the ELC case, as the plaintiffs’ intention is to abuse the Court process and gain control of the Society’s affairs in order to compromise the ELC case and ultimately manage to grab the public land in question in the said case.






51.
Counsel relied on the decision arising from the case of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Goldenberg Affair and another v Kilach ]2003] eKLR, wherein the Court stated that duty is placed upon an exparte applicant to make full disclosure of all relevant information in his possession whether or not they assist his application, and it is important for full and frank disclosure to be made as the Court is only privy to one party’s evidence. Counsel also relied on the case of The King v The General Commissioners for the Purposes of the 
Income Tax Act
 for the District of Kensington [1917] 1 KB 486 (as cited with approval in the case of Nixon Murathi Kiratu v Director of Criminal Investigations anothers; Mercy Nyakio Mburu & another (Interested parties) [2019] eKLR, where the Court laid down the legal principle that an exparte applicant must make a full and fair disclosure of all material facts.






52.
He stated that in addition to the non-disclosure, the plaintiffs have misrepresented various facts to this Court in their application, including the allegation that the meeting of 2
nd
 May, 2024 aborted because the defendants walked out, which is not true because the meeting was concluded and the Registrar subsequently issued her determination on 3
rd
 May, 2024. Counsel stated that from the authorities he cited, the plaintiffs had an obligation to disclose all material facts within their knowledge, and since they did not, the exparte orders wrongly obtained by the plaintiffs should be vacated forthwith.






53.
Mr. Tugee cited the case of Giella v Cassman Brown & Company Ltd (supra), on the principles that need to be satisfied by the plaintiffs in order for an injunction to be granted, Counsel stated that the plaintiffs must satisfy the three principles laid down in the said case. He also cited the case of Mrao Ltd v First American Bank of Kenya Ltd & 2 others [2003] KLR 125, on what constitutes a prima facie case.






54.
Counsel submitted that the plaintiffs have filed the suit and application herein, in their alleged status as officials of the Society, but they have not rendered any evidence to prove that they are indeed members of the Society and not merely residents of the Estate. He stated the defendants have substantively poked holes in the legitimacy of the alleged elections during which the plaintiffs claim to have been elected as officials of the Society.






55.
Mr. Tugee submitted that the reasons given above, the plaintiffs have not established a prima facie case with a probability of success.






56.
As to whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable loss, Mr. Tugee was of the view that they have not, as the legitimacy of the plaintiffs’ elections as the officials of the Society has been put into question, and at the same time, the defendants assert that they are the validly elected officials from a meeting held on 20
th
 January, 2024, and both parties have produced documents to support their respective positions.






57.
Counsel asserted that there is need for this Court to interrogate who between the plaintiffs and the defendants is telling the truth in regard to who the validly elected officials of the Society are, and that can only be done after a full hearing that allows for testing the evidence presented before this Court. He relied on the case of Nguruman Limited v Jan Bonde Nielsen & 2 others (supra), where the Court held that establishing a prima facie case alone is not a sufficient ground for granting an interlocutory injunction.






58.
Counsel submitted that if the plaintiffs will be eventually successful in the suit, they will not suffer any irreparable injury/loss if the interlocutory conservatory orders sought are not granted at this stage because any loss suffered can be compensated by an award of damages, and if this Court finds in favour of the plaintiffs upon the hearing of the substantive suit, the defendants will simply and seamlessly hand over the management of the Society to the plaintiffs.






59.
In concluding his submissions, Mr. Tugee asserted that the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the defendants because if ultimately the plaintiffs succeed in the suit, the defendants will hand over leadership to the plaintiffs, but if an injunction is granted and the defendants are eventually successful, the Society’s affairs will have been managed by strangers who are non-members and who will not have acted in the best interest of the Society but for their own personal interest. He added that the said state of affairs will occasion anarchy, confusion, and injustice that will result in tremendous prejudice to the defendants, the members of the Society, and the residents of the Estate, and impose unelected persons to run the affairs of a membership Society by deceiving this Court.






60.
He contended that the Society will be at the risk of an influx of claims for various breaches of contract during the period at which the plaintiffs would have been in charge of the Society’s affairs as demonstrated by the 2
nd
 interested party’s application dated 13
th
 May, 2024.






61.
Counsel prayed for the exparte orders granted on 7
th
 May, 2024 to be discharged, for the hearing of the main suit to be expedited to determine the rights of the parties conclusively, and then decide whether or not to grant the reliefs sought in the plaint.








Rejoinder by the plaintiffs


62.
The plaintiffs in their written submissions dated 22
nd
 May, 2024, addressed the application dated 9
th
 May, 2024 filed by the defendants seeking to have the exparte orders discharged. Mr. Abdiaziz Advocate, stated that the defendants seek to have the said orders discharged on the allegation of non-disclosure of material facts. He indicated that the same was not true as the plaintiffs moved to Court with clean hands, and are deserving of the remedies sought.






63.
Counsel contended that failure to disclose about the existence of ELCL/E136 of 2014; Phase II Estate v Regnoil Oil Kenya Limited was not material to the present case, as the said suit and this one, deal with two distinct issues being election of officials of an Association, and the other being ownership of property. He stated that the plaintiffs are not estopped from bringing the present suit against the defendants herein. Counsel contended that the defendants are bringing non-issues to this suit and shifting the Court’s attention from the real issues in dispute which are mis-management of the Estate and embezzlement of the residents’ funds contributed for running the affairs of the Estate.






64.
Counsel stated that the interim orders issued by the Court were granted because this Court was satisfied that the applicants and fellow Estate’s residents’ rights were being or were likely to be trampled upon, and therefore the same needed to be protected in the interim pending the hearing and determination of the application and suit.






65.
He submitted that although setting aside of the said orders is at the Court’s discretion, the said discretion should be exercised judiciously and not capriciously. He stated that the defendants have admitted that the plaintiffs have already taken the reigns of the Estate and reversing the same will cause more harm than good as the defendants’ term lapsed, and they do not have any mandate from the residents of the Estate. He contended that setting aside the orders already in force will be a clear miscarriage of justice.






66.
Counsel stated that the orders of 7
th
 May, 2024 were obtained with full disclosure of material facts and will be, and have been used only for the intended purpose of sheltering the members and residents of the Estate from the defendants’ rule of tyranny and misfeasance.






67.
The plaintiffs filed supplementary submissions dated 5
th
 June, 2024, wherein Mr. Abdiaziz Advocate stated that by the Registrar of Societies rendering a decision vide a letter dated 21
st
 May, 2024 in which she suspended her earlier decision of 3
rd
 May, 2024, she submitted to this Court’s jurisdiction, and became functus officio. Counsel stated that this Court has the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the suit before it, as the issues raised by the parties herein touch on the issue of election of officials and mismanagement of the Estate finances and use of force to run the affairs of the Estate.






68.
As for not disclosing about the letter from the Registrar dated 3
rd
 May, 2024, Counsel stated that the plaintiffs were not in receipt of the said letter as at the time they were filing the suit herein.






69.
Mr. Abdiaziz referred to the plaintiffs’ supplementary affidavit sworn on 5
th
 June, 2024, and contended that the plaintiffs have brought to light the defendants’ unlawful actions of forging and cooking up affidavits to be used before Court for purposes of gaining an upper hand to their advantage. He further contended that the residents of Phase II Diamond Estate will be highly prejudiced if the orders obtained on 7
th
 May, 2024 are set aside over an illegality perpetuated by the defendants as proved before this Court.






70.
He relied on the case of John Njue Njenga v Nicholas Njiru Nyaga & another [2013] eKLR, where the Court of Appeal stated that whoever comes to equity must come with clean hands and equity frowns upon secrecy and underhand dealings. The said Court went on to say that the applicant therein had not gone to Court with clean hands and was undeserving of the orders he had sought.






71.
Counsel prayed for the plaintiffs’ application to be allowed with costs, and for the defendants’ application to be dismissed with costs.








Analysis and Determination


72.
I have considered the application filed by the plaintiffs and the one filed by the defendants, the affidavits in support of and in opposition to the said applications, as well as the further and supplementary affidavits. I have also considered the submissions filed by Counsel for the parties. The issues that arise for determination are-
i.
If this Court has the jurisdiction to determine the matter before it;
ii.
If the answer to issue No. (i) is in the affirmative, whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the conditions for being granted an interim injunction;
iii.
If the Registrar of Societies should be directed to issue an interim certificate to the plaintiffs recognizing them as officials of the Society;
iv.
If a mareva injunction should be granted;
v.
If an order for audit of the Society’s accounts for the last five (5) years should be granted; and
vi.
If the exparte orders granted on 7
th
 May, 2024 should be discharged.
If this Court has the jurisdiction to determine the application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024.






73.
In their application, the plaintiffs not only seek conservatory orders pending the hearing and determination of the suit, but also seeks a mareva injunction to freeze the bank account of the Association (hereinafter referred to as the Society). The plaintiffs also seek an order directed to the interested party to issue them with an interim certificate recognizing the appointment of new officials of the Society, and also an order for the appointment of an independent Auditor to audit the accounts of the Society for the last five (5) years. In Mr. Tugee’s view, the plaintiffs should not have filed the suit before this Court when the Registrar of Societies (Registrar) was seized of the matter of election of the officials of the Society, and since the said Registrar had vide her letter dated 3
rd
 May, 2024 given directions to the officials of the Society (defendants) to hold elections within forty-five (45) days from the date of the said letter.






74.
On the other hand, Mr. Abdiaziz for the plaintiffs took the stand that the Registrar is functus officio after she wrote the letter dated 21
st
 May, 2024 submitting to the jurisdiction of this Court. Due to the two conflicting positions taken by the two Advocates, it is necessary to look at the provisions of Section 18 of the 
Societies Act
.






75.
The said Section provides as follows-
“(1)
If the Registrar is of the opinion that a dispute has occurred among the members or officers of a registered society as a result of which the Registrar is not satisfied as to the identity of the persons who have been properly constituted as officers of the society, the Registrar may, by order in writing, require the society to produce to him, within one month of the service of the order, evidence of the settlement of the dispute and of the proper appointment of the lawful officers of the society or of the institution of proceedings for the settlement of such dispute.
(2)
If an order under subsection (1) of this section is not complied with to the satisfaction of the Registrar within the period of one month or any longer period which the Registrar may allow, the Registrar may cancel the registration of the society.
(3)
A society aggrieved by the cancellation of its registration under subsection (2) may appeal to the High Court within thirty days of such cancellation.” (Emphasis added).






76.
From the provisions of Section 18(1) of the 
Societies Act
, the Registrar of Societies has the powers to deal with issues of election of officials of Societies. When a dispute was brought to her attention as to who the bonafide officials of the Society herein are, she invited the two parties to a facilitative meeting held on 2nd May, 2024. After holding a meeting on the said date, on 3
rd
 May, 2024, she directed the parties herein to hold elections within forty-five (45) days from the said date. The said elections were however not held as directed, as the plaintiffs moved to Court and sought interim orders, pending interpartes hearing of their application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024.






77.
The defendants accuse the plaintiffs of non-disclosure of material information by failing from the outset to inform this Court that the Registrar was seized of the dispute that the plaintiffs brought to Court. The plaintiffs however state that by the time they filed their application on 6
th
 May, 2024, they had not received the letter dated 3
rd
 May, 2024 from the Registrar. A perusal of the supporting affidavit sworn by Abdirizack Bishar Aress sworn on 2
nd
 May, 2024 states that when the defendants attended the meeting called by the Registrar, they were asked hard questions and they walked out. The defendants however state that they did not walk out of the meeting, as the said meeting was concluded, and it culminated in the Registrar writing the letter dated 3
rd
 May, 2024. From a reading of the entire supporting affidavit that was sworn on the day of the meeting on 2
nd
 May, 2024, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs had not received the letter dated 3
rd
 May, 2024 and could therefore not have spoken of the contents of a letter they had not received. As concerns the allegation raised by the plaintiffs that the defendants walked out of the meeting of 2
nd
 May, 2024, I do not think that the plaintiffs are being candid. In the replying affidavit sworn by the Registrar, she deposed that the defendants attended the meeting although they had written to her asking her to postpone the said meeting. She further deposed that the meeting was turned into a shouting contest between the parties herein. In my view, if the defendants had walked out of the meeting as alleged, the Registrar would not have had difficulties in stating so in her affidavit.






78.
It therefore appears to me that the plaintiffs moved to Court because of the meeting they held on 13
th
 April, 2024 in which they were allegedly elected as the officials of the Society. The defendants on the other hand also claim to have been elected as the officials of the Society in a meeting held on 20
th
 January, 2024.






79.
Faced with the impasse, the Registrar of Societies could have dealt with the issue of the elections of the officials if the plaintiffs herein had not moved to Court. Nonetheless, since the plaintiffs’ application is not only seeking an order for them to be recognized as the bonafide officials of the Society and to have the Registrar issue a certificate to that effect, by virtue of the other prayers being sought, the High Court in the exercise of its unlimited and original jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 165(3)(a) of 
the Constitution
 has the jurisdiction to hear the and determine the prayers sought by the plaintiffs. The Registrar could not have granted conservatory orders, a mareva injunction and an order for the audit of the accounts of the Society, as those are issues that that fall under the jurisdiction of the High Court.






80.
In addition to the foregoing, my understanding of the provisions of Section 18(1) of the 
Societies Act
 is that it gives the Registrar the powers to determine a dispute as to who the bonafide officials of a Society are, and the Registrar may require the Society to produce to him within a month of the service of the order, evidence of the settlement of the dispute and of the proper appointment of the lawful officers of the Society. In the alternative, evidence of the institution of proceedings for the settlement of such dispute can be provided to the Registrar. It is therefore evident from the said provisions that resolution of disputes when it comes to leadership of Societies can also be filed in Court, as the plaintiffs herein have done.






81.
Mr. Tugee asserted that the plaintiffs should have filed an appeal, in my view, an appeal can only lie after the decision of the Registrar has been communicated to the parties and they are dissatisfied with it. In the present scenario, the defendants vide their letter dated 6
th
 May, 2024 expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision of the Registrar, but they did not file an appeal. As I had earlier stated, the suit herein was filed before the plaintiffs had received communication from the Registrar directing that fresh elections be held within forty-five (45) days from 3
rd
 May, 2024.








Whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the conditions for being granted an interim injunction.


82.
In order to determine the above issue, it is important to first address the contestation raised by the defendants and their Counsel as to whether or not the plaintiffs had the locus standi to file the application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024 in their capacity as officials of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road Nairobi. In the case of Alfred Njau –Vs- City Council of Nairobi [1983] KLR 625 the Court of Appeal, held inter alia on the issue of locus standi-
“
…Locus standi” literally means a place of standing and refers to the right to appear or be heard in Court or other proceedings and to say that a person has no locus standi means that he has no right to appear or be heard in such and such a proceeding”.






83.
The plaintiffs contend that they were elected in a Special General meeting of Diamond Park 2 Residents held on 13
th
 April, 2024 at 2.30 p.m., after issuance of a Notice dated 15
th
 March, 2024 for an Extraordinary Resident’s meeting. A perusal of the said Notice shows that it was addressed to the residents of the said Estate and it was signed by Sulekha Mohamed Khalif, as the Interim Secretary. It is however not clear how she came about to be appointed as the Interim Secretary.






84.
The Constitution
 of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road provides as follows in clauses 9(c), (d) and (e) in regard to the holding of a Special General Meeting-
“
(c)
A special general meeting may be called for any specific purpose by the committee. Notice in writing for such meeting shall be sent to all members not less than 7 days before the date thereof and where practicable by press advertisement not less than 7 days before the date of such meeting.
(d)
A special meeting may also be requested for a specific purpose by order in writing to the Secretary of not less than a third of the members and such meeting shall be held within 21 days of the date of requisition. The notice of such meeting shall be as shown in Rule 8(c) and no matter shall be discussed other than that stated in the requisition.
(e)
Quorum for general meetings shall be not less than two thirds of the registered members of the Society.” (Emphasis added).






85.
As per clause 7 of 
the Constitution
 of the Society, the Committees contemplated shall consist of one office bearer of the Society and two other members elected at the Annual General meeting. In this instance, the plaintiffs have not exhibited any evidence to show that the Committee called for a Special General Meeting under clause 9(c) of 
the Constitution
 of the Society, or that a third of the members of the Association wrote to the Secretary requesting for a meeting under clause 9(d) of the said Constitution, and that the plaintiffs were elected as officials of the Society in a properly convened Special General Meeting or a Special Meeting of the Society.






86.
From their affidavit sworn on 2
nd
 May, 2024, in support of their application, the plaintiffs averred that they took matters into their own hands and called a meeting on 13
th
 April, 2024, where issues affecting the Estate were deliberated and new officials were elected and almost 100 residents signed the said minutes.






87.
The plaintiffs further averred that the new officials through their Secretary wrote a letter to the Registrar of Societies informing the Registrar of the new development in the Estate and submitted the minutes of the meeting of the residents together with a list of the Estate officials.






88.
They deposed that the residents of the Estate once again through the Secretary wrote a letter dated 19
th
 April, 2024 to the Registrar of Societies requesting for the immediate freezing of the Association’s accounts to avert misuse of the Association’s funds by the rogue outgoing officials, after which the said Registrar called for a consultative meeting for 2
nd
 May, 2024 for the officials to resolve the underlying issues. As earlier stated, the said meeting went on as scheduled.






89.
Going back to 
the Constitution
 of the Society, Clause 6 provides that the office bearers of the Society shall be –
“
(i)
The Chairperson;
(ii)
The Vice-Chairperson;
(iii)
The Secretary;
(iv)
The Vice-Secretary;
(v)
The Treasurer; and
(vi)
The Vice-Treasurer,
All of whom shall be fully paid-up members of the Society and shall be elected at the Annual General meeting to be held each year.” (Emphasis added)






90.
Clause 6(b) of 
the Constitution
 of the Society provides that all office bearers shall hold office from the date of their election, for a period of two (2) years, until the succeeding Annual General Meeting subject to the conditions contained in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of the said Rule but shall be eligible for re-election.






91.
From the provisions I have reproduced from Clause 6 of 
the Constitution
 of the Society, it was not envisaged that there would ever be an Interim Secretary who would issue Notices of meetings of the Society as there is provision for a Vice-Secretary who would step into the shoes of the Secretary if a vacancy was to arise in the office of the Secretary, or in his absence.






92.
As was correctly pointed out by the defendants, the Special General meeting convened on 13
th
 April, 2024 by the Sulekha Mohamed Khalif, the 3
rd
 plaintiff herein, was for Diamond Park 2 Residents after the purported issuance of a Notice dated 15
th
 March, 2024. It is evident from the said Notice that it was not addressed to the members of Phase II Diamond Estate Association. As was correctly pointed out by the defendants, there is a stark difference between being a resident of Phase II Diamond Estate, and being a member of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road Nairobi. There was also no evidence exhibited to demonstrate that the plaintiffs who allege to have been elected as officials of the Society are indeed its members by virtue of having applied for membership, that they had been admitted by the Committee as members of the said Society, and they had paid up membership subscriptions.






93.
A perusal of the minutes of 13
th
 April, 2024 shows that it was resolved that that an alternative Association with the name of Diamond Park 2 Residents Association was to be registered. That in itself evidently demonstates that the plaintiffs were not bonafide officials of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road, because if they were, and if they had the best interest of the Society at heart, they would not have resolved to register another Society to serve the same community, as that would be working at cross-purposes with the Society that was registered in the year 2021.






94.
From the foregoing summation, it is apparent that the plaintiffs in their affidavits did not exhibit a Notice of a properly convened Annual General meeting, a Special Meeting or a Special General Meeting to elect new officials of Phase II Diamond Estate Association Likoni Road Nairobi. It then follows that the Notice issued by the 3
rd
 plaintiff herein, as the purported Interim Secretary was null and void ab initio and was of no consequence whatsoever. Any action therefore taken pursuant to the said Notice, including the purported election of the plaintiffs as the new officials of the said Society was illegal, as it had no legal backing. Given the said circumstances, I do agree with Mr. Tugee that the plaintiffs did not have the requisite locus standi to file the application herein on behalf of the Society. That being the case, the plaintiffs on behalf of the Society have not passed the first hurdle of establishing a prima facie case as set out in the case of Giella v Cassman Brown & Co. Ltd (supra).






95.
The plaintiffs’ prayer is to continue remaining in office as per the exparte orders granted by this Court on 7
th
 May, 2024. They accuse the defendants of harassment of residents, misappropriation of the funds paid by the residents of Phase II Diamond Estate. In the case of Nguruman Limited v Jan Bonde Nielsen & 2 others (supra), the Court held as follows-
“
On the second factor, that the applicant must establish that he might otherwise suffer irreparable injury which cannot be remedied by damages in the absence of an injunction, is a threshold requirement and the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate prima facie, the nature and extent of the injury. Speculative injury will not do; there must be more than an unfounded fear or apprehension on the part of the applicant. The equitable remedy of temporary injunction is issued solely to prevent grave and irreparable injury; that is injury that is actual, substantial and demonstrable; injury that cannot adequately be compensated by an award of damages. An injury is irreparable where there is no standard by which their amount can be measured with reasonable accuracy or the injury or harm is such a nature that monetary compensation, of whatever amount, will never be adequate remedy.” (Emphasis added)






96.
Had I found that the plaintiffs had the locus standi to file the application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024, my finding on whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the 2
nd
 condition of irreparable loss for being granted an interim injunction would have been that they have not. They have alleged misappropriation of funds in the hands of the defendants. It is my finding that the plaintiffs would not have successfully assailed the 2
nd
 condition for being granted an order for an injunction, as their claim of misappropriation of funds is speculative and unsupported by evidence, and if at all the defendants would have been found to be culpable, the plaintiffs would have been compensated by an award of damages.






97.
The plaintiffs also allege abuse of human rights by the defendants by allegedly limiting the rights of the children to play outside, and by limiting their playground space in the Estate. Those are however matters that fall in the realm of the Constitutional Court and not the Commercial Court.






98.
Having found that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case against the defendants due to lack of locus standi, and that they would not have surmounted the hurdle of irreparable loss if they had locus standi, the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the defendants.






99.
Since I have found that the plaintiffs had no locus standi to file the application herein, there is no need to dwell on the issues of whether they concealed material facts from the Court by not disclosing about the pending case in ELCL/E136 of 2024; Phase II Diamond Estate Association versus Regnoil Oil Kenya Limited.






100.
In the further affidavit filed by the defendants, they annexed a Notice dated 29
th
 December, 2023 on a letter head of Phase II Diamond Estate Likoni Road Nairobi, in which members of the said Society were notified of a meeting that was to be held on 20
th
 January, 2024 at Pearl Village in South C. Agenda item No. (iv) of the said Notice was on election of a Management Committee. The said meeting was convened by the Secretary Abdullahi Ibrahim Mohamed. In the minutes of the said meeting, the names of the members who attended are captured thereon, as well as their signatures. On item D on re-election of the Management Committee, the minutes show that it was unanimously resolved that all except one Management Committee (member), were to continue in office for the next two (2) years. The minutes show that there was a change in the Chairman’s position and the outgoing Chairman Douglas Ng’ang’a was replaced by Abdiweli Adan Kalicha as the new Chairman.






101.
In the said further affidavit, the defendants averred that the newly elected Chairman, the Secretary and the Treasurer of the Society notified the Registrar of Societies by filing Form H in accordance with Rule 11 of the Societies Rules on elections and change in the person holding the position of the Chairman, and that the Registrar of Societies is yet to effect the said change. Having found that the purported elections of 13
th
 April, 2024 were not conducted in a properly convened meeting of the Society, it is upon the defendants to pursue the registration of the changes made in the meeting of 20
th
 January, 2024 with the Registrar of Societies, since there can be no vacuum in the running of the affairs of the Society.






102.
Allegations of forged documents and affidavits can only be determined upon hearing of witnesses and not at the interim stage. In light of my finding that the plaintiffs are not members of the Society and had no locus standi to file the application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024 on behalf of the Society as they were not elected as officials of the said Society in a properly convened meeting, it means that the prayers sought in the application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024 cannot be granted.






103.
This Court exercised its discretion when it granted the exparte orders. However, having addressed its mind to the lengthy affidavits that were filed and having perused the annexures in support of each party’s case, and having applied the applicable law to the facts of the application, the order that commends itself to me is for the setting aside of the exparte orders that I granted on 7
th
 May, 2024.






104.
In the result, the plaintiffs’ application dated 2
nd
 May, 2024 is hereby dismissed with costs to the defendants. The defendants’ application dated 9
th
 May, 2024 is hereby allowed with costs to be borne by the plaintiffs. It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The applicant was adjudged guilty of defilement contrary to section 8 (1) as read with 8 (2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years.






2.
He initially lodged an appeal in High Court Criminal Appeal No E109 of 2021 but withdrew it on 8
th
 November 2021. The current revision only seeks grant of credit for the period spent in remand custody.






3.
I called for the records of the subordinate court. Being a revision, and by dint of section 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, no party has a right to be heard either personally or by an advocate before the High Court when exercising its powers of revision.






4.
Section 333 (2) of the Code, obligates the sentencing court to take into account the period spent in remand custody. In Ahamad Abolfathi Mohammed & Another v Republic, Court of Appeal at Nairobi, Criminal Appeal 135 of 2016 [2018] eKLR, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal called for a “more meaningful” application of that provision of the law.






5.
I am now satisfied of the following set of facts: The accused was arrested on 26
th
 September 2012. Upon taking plea, he was granted cash bail of Kshs 100,000 but could not raise it. Following a number of applications for review, the amount was reduced to Kshs 20,000 on 27
th
 March 2013. From the original receipt, he only managed to post bail on 20
th
 May 2013 and enjoyed his freedom until the date of judgment on 7
th
 June 2019.






6.
On 24
th
 June 2023 he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. The trial court did not however credit him with any time spent in remand custody amounting to 236 days.






7.
For all the above reasons and guided by section 333 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I order that a period of 236 days spent in remand custody shall be deducted from the sentence. The original lower court file shall now be returned to Makadara Law Courts. The applicant and the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be immediately notified of this order.
It is so ordered.

Judgment










1.
This is an appeal against the Appellant’s conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for incest under Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No.3 of 2006. The particulars of the offence were that the Appellant on diverse dates between 10
th
 December 2020 and 9
th
 January 2020 at [Particulars Withheld] area in Mt. Elgon sub-county within Bungoma County, being a male person, caused his penis to penetrate the vagina of PC a female aged 4 years and 8 months who was to his knowledge his daughter.






2.
He also faced an alternative charge of indecent act with a child contrary to Section 11(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No.3 of 2006. The particulars of the offence were that the Appellant on diverse dates between 10
th
 December 2020 and 9
th
 January 2020 at [Particulars Withheld] area in Mt. Elgon sub-county within Bungoma County intentionally and unlawfully touched the vagina of PC a female aged 4 years and 8 months.






3.
The Appellant’s appeal is on the following grounds:
i.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and facts by failing to appreciate the facts and applicable law thereby making a wrong decision.
ii.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by proceeding with the case in a language foreign to the Appellant, which he did not understand thereby making a wrong judgement.
iii.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to identify the ingredients of the alleged offence and/or issues for determination thereby make a wrong conclusion.
iv.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by shifting the burden of proof thereby made a wrong judgement.
v.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by admitting and relying on the evidence of doubtful witnesses hence arriving a wrong finding.
vi.
That the learned trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting the Appellant against the weight of the evidence thereby making a wrong decision.






4.
The role of this Court in its appellate jurisdiction is to review all the evidence and to make its own conclusions being careful to note that it did not itself hear the testimony or see the demeanour of witnesses. See (Okeno v R [1972] EA 32).






5.
The brief facts are that PC, testified as PW1 vide a next friend in the name of Lydia Masai, a children officer based at Bungoma West as the complainant who was of tender age. She testified that the complainant recalled on 10
th
 December 2020 at unknown time her mother had differed with the Appellant herein (her step father) and that she left in a huff leaving her behind with the Appellant herein. She testified that she was defiled by the Appellant herein and that she sustained injuries on her private parts. That her mother returned the following day and found her in pain and on interrogating her she divulged that the Appellant had defiled her and that she felt immense pain in her private parts. That she was rushed to Kaptama Health Centre for treatment but was referred to Sirisia Sub-County Hospital due to the extent of her injuries. At Sirisia Sub-County Hospital, she was referred to Moi Teaching Hospital and Referral Hospital at Eldoret for further treatment and that she stayed there for some time. That she had to undergo reconstructive surgery of her vagina due to fistula issue and after recovery she was discharged. That she was able to identify the perpetrator as the Appellant in the dock. On cross-examination, she referred to the Appellant as her father and that it was him who defiled her and that she was not re-counting what her mother had stated.






6.
PW2 was CNW who testified that PC is her daughter and that the Appellant herein was her husband. According to her, on 10
th
 December 2020 at around 11.00 am, she was subjected to domestic violence by the Appellant herein prompting her to run away in efforts to save her life. She left him with her two children, , and proceeded to the home of a village elder to seek shelter. On 11
th
 December 2020, on the advice of the village elder she returned home and proceeded to seek medical attention. According to her, she directed one Lenah to go and pick her daughter as she went with her son. She later on received a call from the biological father of her daughter alerting her that she had been defiled and had been rushed to Eldoret for treatment. On cross-examination, she identified the Appellant as her husband and noted that the Appellant was not the biological father of her daughter.






7.
PW3 was BCW, who testified that he is the biological father of the complainant herein and that on 10
th
 December 2020, at 1500hrs he received a call from his cousin, L, telling him that he should go home and check on his daughter whom she was living with. He quickly proceeded to her house and was shown the private parts of his daughter, who was complaining to be in pain and not feeling well. He was not aware of what the problem was and so they took her to Kaptama Health Centre the next day where they were referred to Sirisia Sub-County Hospital where they were again referred to Bungoma Referral Hospital where they were subsequently referred to Eldoret Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. He told the Court that he was advised to look for the mother of the complainant as she had been defiled. He reached out to PW2 who came to the hospital. He told the Court that the Appellant is responsible for what happened to his daughter and that he knows him very well. On cross-examination, he told the Court that he is the biological father of the complainant but that the Appellant lived with her.






8.
PW4 was Mr. Paul Wamalwa who testified that he is a clinical officer attached to Sirisia Sub-County Hospital. According to him, he was in Court to produce the complainant’s medical treatment notes from Kaptanai dispensary, Sirisia Sub-County Hospital dated 14
TH
 January 2021 and 18
th
 February 2021 respectively. He also had the discharge summary from Eldoret Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital dated 18
th
 January 2021 and P3 form dates 25
th
 March 2021. He told the Court that the complainant, aged 4 years then, was presented to their facility with a history of passing stool through the vagina and difficulty in walking; that this was a result of defilement by a person well known to her. On examination, he observed that her hymen was broken, presence of fecal matter on the vagina as well as communication between the vagina wall and rectum. Further, he observed that there were lacerations on the anal canal. They administered painkillers and antibiotics to the complainant and referred her to Eldoret for further analysis and medication. He told the Court that she underwent rectal vaginal fistula repair while at Eldoret. It was his finding that the 4-year-old complainant was defiled as result of the sustained rectal vaginal fistula and he gauged her injuries as grievous harm. He produced in Court several exhibits inter alia; the treatment notes from Sirisia Sub-County Hospital as PEXH.1; Complainant’s outpatient card from Bungoma County Referral Hospital as PEXH.2; Discharge summary from Eldoret MTRH as PEXH.3; P3 Form dated 25
th
 March 2021 as PEXH.4; Treatment notes from Kaptanai Dispensary as PEXH.5. On cross-examination, he told the Court that no medical examination was conducted on the Appellant as he was never presented to their facility.






9.
PW5 was No. 235878 PC Samwel Oyoo who testified that he was the investigating officer in this matter. According to him, on 3
rd
 January 2021while at Nawela Police Post, he received a report wherein the Appellant herein was a suspect in a defilement case and in which the complainant was the victim. He commenced investigations by visiting the scene but he did not find the Appellant. He established that he had relocated to Kiambu County but they were able to track him down with the help of PW3. He later received a tip-off that he had been spotted at Kona shopping Centre and that he proceeded there and met him and that after introductions he requested that they proceed to Namwela Police Post for interrogation to which he complied. On 18
th
 October 2021, he proceeded to charge him with the offence of incest as he was living with the complainant as a father even though not her biological father. On cross-examination, he stated that he did not involve the area chief or clan elder in the appellant’s arrest.






10.
Upon the close of the prosecution’s case, the Appellant was found to have a case to answer and that he opted to tender an unsworn statement but later changed his mind and elected to remain silent in defence.






11.
Vide Court directions issued on 12
th
 February 2024, the appeal was to be canvassed by way of written submissions. Both parties have duly complied.






12.
This being the first appellate Court, its duty is to reconsider and re-evaluate the evidence adduced before the trial court and make its own conclusions. It should however give regard to the fact that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses. See: Kisumu Criminal Appeal 28 of 2009 David Njuguna Wairimu v Republic [2010] eKLR where the Court of appeal stated:
“
The duty of the first appellate court is to analyse and re-evaluate the evidence which was before the trial court and itself come to its own conclusions on that evidence without overlooking the conclusions of the trial court. There are instances where the first appellate court may, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, come to the same conclusions as those of the lower court. It may rehash those conclusions. We do not think there is anything objectionable in doing so, provided it is clear that the court has considered the evidence on the basis of the law and the evidence to satisfy itself on the correctness of the decisions.”






13.
The issues arising for determination based on the grounds of appeal are as follows:
a.
What are the ingredients for proof of incest and whether incest was proved in the instant case?
b.
Whether the sentence was lawful and proportionate






14.
Section 20 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 deals with incest by males. It provides as follows:
“
incest by male persons
20.
(1)
Any male person who commits an indecent act or an act which causes penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years: Provided that, if it is alleged in the information or charge and proved that the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.
(2)
If any male person attempts to commit the offence specified in subsection (1), he is guilty of an offence of attempted incest and is liable upon conviction to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years.
(3)
Upon conviction in any court of any male person for an offence under this section, or of an attempt to commit such an offence, it shall be within the power of the court to issue orders referred to as “section 114 orders” under the Children’s Act and in addition divest the offender of all authority over such female, remove the offender from such guardianship and in such case to appoint any person or persons to be the guardian or guardians of any such female during her minority or less period.”






15.
The charge sheet in this case specified the offence as “incest contrary to Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
”. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial Magistrate Court found and concluded as follows:
“
…There are no glaring doubts per se on the Prosecution evidence. The witnesses were consistent and credible and degree highly probable in my view.
The said evident is copious, overwhelming and compelling as well as of stubborn nature and resolve which resolve must benefit the victim and indeed the prosecution.
For this reason, I find the accused person JSW guilty of the offence of incest contrary to Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 No. 3 of 2006 and do hereby convict him accordingly.”






a. What are the ingredients for proof of incest and whether incest was proved in the instant case?


16.
The ingredients for the offence of incest are:
(i)
Proof that the offender is a relative of the victim.
(ii)
Proof of penetration or indecent Act.
(iii)
Identification of the perpetrator.
(iv)
Proof of the age of the victim.






17.
On the first ingredient, the evidence of the complainant was that the Appellant was her “baba” and at the material time, she was living with him. Her mother, PW2, further expounded on the actual relationship stating that the Appellant was the complainant’s stepfather. In cross examination, she insisted that the Appellant was her father and that she was living with him.






18.
To understand whether indeed the degree of consanguinity contemplated under Section 20 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 was established, reference is made to Section 22 of the Act which provides that:
“
22(1) In cases of the offences of incest, brother and sister includes half-brother, half-sister and adoptive brother and adoptive sister and a father includes a half father and an uncle of the first degree and a mother includes a half mother and an aunt of the first degree whether through lawful wedlock or not …”






19.
Further, sub-section (3) reads:
“
22(3) A accused person shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have had knowledge, at the time of the alleged offence, of the relationship existing between him or her and the other party to the incest.”






20.
In this case, the complainant testified that the Appellant was her “baba”, with her mother (PW2) testifying that he was her stepfather and that the complainant’s biological father is PW3. It is common knowledge that although Section 22 does not use the word stepfather, the phrase half father refers to a stepfather. Hence, by being a stepfather to the complainant, the Appellant’s relationship with the complainant fell within the prohibited degree of consanguinity contemplated under Section 20 and 22 of the Act.






21.
I do, in the circumstances, align myself with Court of Appeal decision in Mombasa Criminal Appeal No. 223 of 2009- BNM v Republic [2011] eKLR. The Court held thus:
“
Does this fact that no biological or blood ties exist between the two negate a charge of Incest? The answer is to be found in section 22 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 which deals with ‘Test of relationship’. S. 22(1) provides as follows:
“22(1) In cases of the offences of Incest, brother and sister includes half-brother, half-sister and adoptive brother and adoptive sister and a father includes a half father and an uncle of the first degree and a mother includes a half mother and an aunt of the first degree whether through lawful wedlock or not …”






22.
My own understanding is that ‘half father’ is a term which means exactly the same as ‘step-father’ – it means one who is not a biological father of the child. Therefore, by dint of this Section 22(1) of the Act, the Appellant being a step-father of the complainant and one who stood in ‘loco parenthis’ can legally be charged and indeed convicted of the crime of Incest with her.






23.
In her evidence, the complainant vide her next of friend made a brief statement in which she said that her ‘baba’ whom she positively identified in Court defiled her causing her to sustain injuries on her private parts






24.
On proof of penetration or indecent act, the evidence of PW1 was that the Appellant had carnal knowledge of her, implying there was penetration. Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines penetration as;
“
the partial or complete insertion of the genital organs of a person into the genital organs of another person”.






25.
PW1 testified that the Appellant defiled the complainant on 10
th
 December 2020 just when her mother left her behind with her step-father after their disagreement. On cross-examination, the complainant referred to the Appellant as “baba Jacob” and stated that the Appellant defiled her and that she was not told by PW2 to say that. PW4, Mr. Paul Wamalwa, a clinical officer who filled PW1’s P3 Form testified that upon examination, there was broken hymen and fecal matter on the vagina as well as communication between the vagina wall and rectum. Further, he observed there were lacerations on the anal canal. His prognosis was that the complainant was defiled and that her injuries were of grievous harm.






26.
The examination by PW4 was done on 18
th
 February 2021 whereas the offence was allegedly committed on 10
th
 December 2021 while the P3 form was filled on 25
th
 February 2021. Hence, examination was done two months and eight days after the offence. This sealed the case that PW1 was indeed speaking the truth. The sustained rectal vaginal fistula, anal canal lacerations and a vagina reconstructive surgery were signs that carnal knowledge had definitely taken place.






27.
The Appellant submitted that the learned trial magistrate erred in relying on contradicting evidence of PW1 and PW2 and the fact that the minor at the time of the hearing was five years old was still not allowed to speak in Court. He submitted that it was only upon the Court to declare the complainant a vulnerable witness that the Court can resort to directing that the witness render evidence vide an intermediary and not the prosecution. (Section 31 (5) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
).






28.
On 15
th
 February 2022, it is clear from the lower Court record that the Court on the subsequent request of the Prosecution instructed that the children’s officer from Sirisia children’s office act as guardian ad litem in favour of the complainant herein. The Appellant’s advocate submitted that the process of the complainant testifying through the children’s officer as an intermediary did not materialize.






29.
The Constitution
 of Kenya under Article 53(2) and Section 4(1)(2) of the Children’s Act does provide for the concept of the best interests of the child as a factor to consider in making a decision affecting children. It is therefore one of the foundation stone through which the corpus of our jurisprudence has been developed.






30.
Under the provisions of Section 31(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 was erroneous. Section 31(2) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides as follows:-
“
The court may on its own initiative or on request of the prosecution or any witness other than a witness referred to in subsection (1) who is to give evidence in proceedings referred to in subsection (1), declare any such witness, other than the accused, a vulnerable witness if in the court's opinion he or she is likely to be vulnerable on account of?
a.
Age;
b.
Intellectual, psychological or physical impairment
c.
Trauma;
d.
Cultural differences;
e.
The possibility of intimidation;
f.
Race;
g.
Religion;
h.
Language;
i.
The relationship of the witness to any party to the proceedings;
j.
The nature of the subject matter of the evidence; or
k.
Any other factor the court considers relevant.""






31.
Section 2 of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 defines an intermediary as?
“
a person authorized by a court, on account of his or her expertise or experience, to give evidence on behalf of a vulnerable witness and may include a parent, relative, psychologist, counsellor, guardian, children's officer or social worker"".






32.
In this case, on the request of the Prosecution, the children’s officer from Sirisia was directed to testify as an intermediary. Under the provisions of Section 31(7) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
, an intermediary's role is to convey the substance of any question to a vulnerable witness, inform the Court at any time that the witness is fatigued or stressed and to request the court for recess.






33.
The Court of Appeal in the case of MMV Republic [2004] eKLR stated as follows regarding the procedure of appointing an intermediary and his role-
“
The application must not be granted merely because the victim is young or too old or appears to be suffering from mental disorder. The court itself must be satisfied that the victim or witness would be exposed to undue mental stress and suffering before an intermediary can be appointed. It is clear from what we have said so far that the procedure of appointing an intermediary precedes the testimony of the intended vulnerable witness even where the court does so suo moto. It is also clear that an intermediary can be an expert in a specified field or a person, who through experience, possesses special knowledge in an area or a social worker, or a relative, a parent or a guardian of the witness. The expertise, possession of special knowledge in an area or a social worker, or a relative, a parent or a guardian of the witness. The expertise, possession of special knowledge or relationship with the witness must be ascertained by the trial court through examination of the prospective intermediary before the court appoints him or her. It goes without saying, in view of that role, that an intermediary must subscribe to an appropriate oath ahead of the witness testimony, undertaking to convey correctly and to the best of his/her ability the general purport of the evidence. The Trial Court must then give directions to delineate the extent of the intermediary's participation in the proceedings.”






34.
In this case, it is apparent that the trial Court did follow the correct procedure in receiving the evidence of PW1 in her perceived role as an intermediary after it declared PC a vulnerable witness under the provisions of Section 31(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. PC did not to give evidence due to her tender age of 4 years. In the said circumstances, the children’s officer from Sirisia who testified as PW1, gave evidence on behalf of the complainant. She did play the role of an intermediary. This Court's finding is that the trial Court was proper on the adoption of the evidence of the guardian ad litem as an intermediary as the complainant was a vulnerable witness.






35.
It is almost obvious that sexual assault cases especially those involving minors are committed in exclusion of eye witnesses. That is why the law came to the aid of these vulnerable victims by dint of the proviso to Section 124 of the 
Evidence Act
. The same reads:
“
Provided that where in a criminal case involving a sexual offence the only evidence is that of the alleged victim of the offence, the court shall receive the evidence of the alleged victim and proceed to convict the accused person if, for reasons to be recorded in the proceedings, the court is satisfied that the alleged victim is telling the truth” (emphasis added).






36.
The proviso stipulates that a Court can convict an accused person in a sexual assault cases where the minor is the victim solely on the victim’s evidence as long as the Court believes that the minor is speaking the truth. The learned trial magistrate did believe the evidence of the minor. This Court too, has no reason to doubt that she told the truth. She did not condone the acts of the Appellant as she spoke immediately she was able to that she was assaulted. As fate had it, the medical evidence capped it that she was indeed sexually assaulted. It is also clear that the Appellant took advantage of the fact that he had been left to take care of the complainant after a marital discord with his wife that led to her seeking shelter elsewhere. Instead of cementing the trust bestowed on him, he turned the beast and defiled his daughter.






37.
I need not therefore emphasize that the Appellant’s identification was by way of recognition. He was a person well known to the complainant and besides, a relative. The Appellant was indeed the complainant’s step-father.






38.
The age of a victim in a case of incest is paramount in view of the sentence as prescribed under Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
. The Court of Appeal in Kaingu alias Kasono v R CR Appeal No. 54 of 2010 handed down a powerful Judgment on this issue:
“
Age of the victim of the sexual assault under the 
Sexual Offences Act
 is a critical component. It forms part of the charge which must be proved in the same way as penetration in cases of rape and defilement. It is therefore essential that the same be proved by credible evidence for the sentence to be imposed upon conviction will be dependent on the age of the victim.”






39.
To those urgings, the same Court in 
Richard Wahome Chege v R (CR Appeal No. 61 of 2014
) held that:
“
On the contention that the age of the complainant was not established, it is our considered view that age is not proved primarily by production of a birth certificate, but also by the parent or the doctor who examined the complainant.” (See also Francis Omuroni v Uganda CR Appeal No. 2 of 2000)






40.
In the instant case, the fact of the matter is that the complainant told the Court that he was five years old at the time of rendering her testimony and the available medical record like the Kaptanai Dispensary patient record stipulated her age as four years and so did the NHIF record book as provided by Sirisia sub-County Hospital. It is clear, that by the Court using the evidence of PW1 as the admitted credible evidence on exact age of the complainant at the time of the incident and the availed medical notes to confirm that as of 10
th
 December 2020, the complainant herein was indeed within the range of four years. In any event, whether the age was four or five years, there was no prejudice suffered since the complainant fell within the age bracket of less than eighteen years for purposes of sentencing.






41.
I therefore refute the Appellant’s submissions that the age of PW1 could only be proved by way of presentation of a birth certificate in Court.






42.
I therefore conclude that the prosecution proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt. The conviction of the Appellant was based on cogent evidence adduced by the prosecution and i uphold it.








b. Whether the sentence was lawful and proportionate


43.
On sentence, Section 20(1) of the 
Sexual Offences Act
 provides that:
“
(1)
Any male person who commits an indecent act or an act which causes penetration with a female person who is to his knowledge his daughter, granddaughter, sister, mother, niece, aunt or grandmother is guilty of an offence termed incest and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years, provided that if it is alleged in the information or charge that the female person is under the age of eighteen years, the accused person shall be liable to imprisonment for life and it shall be immaterial that the act which causes penetration or the indecent act was obtained with the consent of the female person.”






44.
This provision is couched in mandatory terms such that a trial Court cannot exercise discretion by deviating from the sentence provided. Indeed, the complainant was aged below five years and a minor at that. The complainant sustained severe injuries as her vaginal wall as well as rectal wall were damaged as a result of the defilement and had to undergo several reconstructive surgery. She suffered great bodily and mental anguish and that she has been scarred for life. She has to contend with a fistula for the better part of her life. She did not deserve to have her life ruined at that young and vulnerable age. The Appellant who was the girl’s step- father was expected to protect her but he instead turned into a monster. It seems he was trying to seek revenge against his wife who had left him following a disagreement. Of course, the hapless complainant had nothing to do with the disagreement between the Appellant and her mother and thus did not deserve to be sexually assaulted. No evidence came out to the effect that the Appellant had been framed for the offence. The Appellant thus deserved a stiff sentence in the circumstances. I find the sentence imposed to be proper in all respects. Hence, I find that the learned trial magistrate rendered a legal sentence as per the law and i see no reason to interfere with it.






45.
In view of the fore going observations, it is my finding that the Appellant’s appeal lacks merit. The same is dismissed. I uphold the conviction and sentence of the trial court.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The 1
st
 Respondent filed this application dated 4
th
 August,2023 which was brought under Articles 162(1)(a), 165(3)(b) and (c) of 
the Constitution
, section 7 of the Fair Administration Act, section 1A, 1B and 3A of 
Civil Procedure Act
, Orders 22 Rule 22(1), Order 10 Rule 11, Order 19 Rule 2 and Order 51 of the Civil Procedure Rules.






2.
The Application is seeking for orders of stay of execution of judgement and decree dated 19
th
 December, 2023, set aside the entire proceedings pending hearing and determination of the application herein.






3.
The Application also sought orders of stay and suspension of the advertisement of 28
th
 July, 2023 by the 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Respondent for the position of chief Boji Heri location in Wajir west Sub County pending the hearing and determination of the application herein.






4.
The Application also sought for orders that the 1
st
 Respondent to be granted leave to defend the suit and the same be heard and determined on merit.






5.
The application was supported by the Affidavit of Wardere Kalihe Shalle the 1
st
 Respondent herein who averred that on 28
th
 July,2023 the 2
nd
 Respondent advertised vacancy for the position of Chief Boji Heri Location, the subject of this suit in compliance with orders of the Judgment delivered on 19
th
 December,2022.






6.
The Applicant averred that if the application was not heard urgently he may end up losing his job when the 2
nd
 to 5
th
 Respondent employs another person to his position. That he had initially filed the application dated 25
th
 May 2023 seeking the stay proceedings which was never heard and it was withdrawn when filing this application.






7.
The Applicant averred that on 5
th
 November,2020 he was appointed as the chief Boji Heri Location in Wajir West Sub County in Wajir County and continued executing his duties.






8.
That on the month of February and March 2023 he did not receive his salary and thought it was a financial constraint on his employer. Upon inquiry in the month of April he was informed that there was a court order terminating his employment as a chief.






9.
That he instructed his advocates to find out only to be shocked that there was a judgement delivered in this matter where he was sued as the 1
st
 Respondent.






10.
The Applicant averred that he was never served with any court summons, pleadings, Mention or hearing notices or any documents relating to the suit. He only came to learn about it when his salary was stopped. That he had a water tight defense and response to the Petition.






11.
The Applicant prayed that he be allowed to file his draft response to the Petition herein to illustrate that he did apply, was interviewed and appointed for the job after advertisement and he was qualified for the same. That he will be condemned unheard without fair hearing if the orders sought herein are not granted.






12.
The Applicant averred that he will suffer loss if the advertisement proceeds while implementing the ex-parte judgement which he was not served with proceedings. That the same should be set aside and his application be allowed.






13.
The Petitioner filed its submissions dated 19
th
 June,2024 but did not file their response to the Application apart from the grounds of opposition to the withdrawn application of 25
th
 May,2023. They opposed the 1
st
 Respondent’s application in their submissions.






Determination


14.
Stay of execution is generally provided for under the Civil Procedure rules under Order 42 Rule 6 which gives the grounds upon which this Court exercises as follows;
(2)
No order for stay of execution shall be made under subrule (1) unless— (a) the court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and (b) such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.






15.
In Nicholas Stephen Okaka & another v Alfred Waga Wesonga [2022] eKLR the court in support of the above provision held as follows: -
Therefore, an applicant for stay of execution of a decree or order pending appeal is obliged to satisfy the conditions set out in Order 42 Rule 6(2), aforementioned: namely
(a)
that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made,
(b)
that the application has been made without unreasonable delay, and
(c)
that such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on the applicant has been given.






16.
As to what substantial loss is, it was observed by Gikonyo J in the case of James Wangalwa & Anor v Agnes Naliaka Cheseto [2012] eKLR. Where the learned Judge observed:
“
No doubt, in law, the fact that the process of execution has been put in motion, or is likely to be put in motion, by itself, does not amount to substantial loss. Even when execution has been levied and completed, that is to say, the attached properties have been sold, as is the case here, does not in itself amount to substantial loss under Order 42 Rule 6 of the CPR. This is so because execution is a lawful process…The applicant must establish other factors which show that the execution will create a state of affairs that will irreparably affect or negate the very essential core of the Applicant as the successful party in the appeal. This is what substantial loss would entail.






17.
As observed in the cases cited above, it is confirmed that no appeal has since been filed to challenge the Court’s judgment revoking the 1
st
 Respondent appointment which was delivered on 19
th
 December,2022 and the 2
nd
 to 5
th
 Respondent have commenced the process of filing up the 1
st
 Respondent position as per court Order by advertising for the position on 28
th
 July,2023.






18.
The 1
st
 Respondent’s assertions that he was not involved in the proceedings cannot be entertained since he never sought that the process server who claimed to have served him be cross examined. The court also notes that judgment in this case was delivered on 19
th
 December,2022 and the 1
st
 Respondent made its first Application on 25
th
 May,2023 which was later withdrawn before filing the current application.






19.
The 1
st
 Respondent did not explain why they did not prosecute their first application properly and in time. The 1
st
 Respondent only rushed to court on this Application when the 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Respondent advertised their position on 28
th
 July,2023. This meant the 1
st
 Respondent relaxed all along only to move the court after his position was being filed up as per the court’s judgment.






20.
The court is therefore of the view that the 1
st
 Respondent did not come to it with clean hands and came when it was inordinately late. There was no appeal preferred against the said decision so one wonders why this court must stay a judgment. Pending which activity?






21.
In addition, staying the court’s judgment and or setting aside the same will have a serious effect on the appointing bodies as well as third parties who will be affected by this move which is requested more than one and half years after delivery of the Judgment.






22.
The orders sought by the 1
st
 Respondent from this court therefore seem to have been overtaken by events due to the lapse a long time after the delivery of the Judgment. The court is therefore of the view that the Applicant has not met the conditions for grant of stay of execution there being no appeal to challenge the Judgment of this court revoking his appointment.






23.
The application is therefore found without merit and is hereby dismissed with costs.






24.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an appeal from the original conviction and sentence in Marsabit Principal Magistrate`s Court Criminal Case No.366 of 2019 by Hon.C.Wekesa, SPM, delivered on 10/5/2023)
        
      






Judgment










1.
The Appellant herein was convicted in absentia for the offence of trafficking in narcotic drugs contrary to section 4(a) of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic substances Control 
Act No.4 of 1994
. The particulars of the offence are that 19
th
 day of June 2019 at Marsabit Central Sub-County within Marsabit County jointly with others not before court were found trafficking Narcotic drugs namely cannabis sativa (bhang) to wit 89 bales of five kilograms each totaling 445 kilograms of street value of Kshs 11,125,000/= by transporting in a Toyota Prado TX registration number KCF 007Q hauling trailer registration number ZB 9366, in contravention to the said Act.






2.
The accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Ksh.33,375,000/= in default to serve imprisonment for a period of 5 years and in addition of the said fine to serve imprisonment for a period of ten years. The appellant was aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence and lodged this appeal. The grounds of appeal are that:
1.
That the trial court erred in fact and in law in failing to consider that the accused was condemned unheard contrary to Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 Of Kenya.
2.
That the trial court erred in fact and in law in failing to consider the Appellant had a right to be present during trial as provided for under Article 50 (2)(f) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya 2010.
3.
That the Honorable court erred in fact and in law in failing to consider that the Appellant is a first-time offender.
4.
That the Trial Court erred in fact and in law in failing to consider that the charge of trafficking narcotic drugs Contrary to section 4(a) of the Narcotic &Psychotropic Substance Control 
Act No. 4 of 1994
 cannot be maintained in the circumstance.
5.
That the trial court erred in fact and law in failing to order the 1
st
 Appellant to be availed in Court instead proceeded to hear and determine the case without the Appellant.
6.
That the trial court erred in law in conducting proceedings that violated the rights of the Appellant as per the provisions of 
the Constitution
 hence null and void.
7.
That the trial court erred in fact and in law in convicting the Appellant based on evidence that was full of contradictions and without analyzing the evidence.
8.
That the trial court erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the fact that no evidence was adduced by the Appellant in his defence for failure of the court to provide security to the Appellant to enable him to be present in Court as he feared for his life.
9.
That the trial court erred in fact and in law in failing to consider that the prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proof to the required standard of proof beyond any reasonable doubt as Appellant Right to defend himself was not protected by the court.
10
That the sentence given was harsh in the circumstances.






Case for the prosecution


3.
The appellant was jointly charged with two other accused persons. The prosecution called seven witnesses in the case. After the first two witnesses had testified, the appellant jumped bail and escaped to the United Kingdom. A year later after the appellant jumped bail, the trial court ordered the case to proceed in the absence of the appellant. The case proceeded in his absence. The appellant`s co-accused were acquitted of the charge and the appellant was convicted.






4.
It was the evidence of PC King`ori Mwaniki PW1 and PC Wycliffe Machogo PW2, police officers stationed at Marsabit police station, that on the 19/6/2019 they were manning a road block at KBC barrier outside the outskirts of Marsabit town along Marsabit Moyale highway. That a police vehicle registration number GK 105 attached to Turbi police station approached the barrier from Moyale direction. It was being followed from behind by a motor vehicle registration No. KCF 007Q Toyota Land Cruiser that was hauling a trailer No. ZB 9366. The two vehicles stopped at the barrier. PC Mwaniki PW1 went to inspect the Prado while PC Machogo PW2 went to check on the GK Vehicle. PC Mwaniki found the Prado being driven by the appellant. There were two passengers in his vehicle. He requested the appellant to allow him inspect the motor vehicle. The appellant declined and said that he was a presidential candidate and could not be subjected to a search. PC Machogo saw his colleague arguing with the appellant and went to inquire as to what was happening. He heard the appellant saying that he is above search as he is a presidential aspirant. He declined to have the motor vehicle searched. The police officers requested the police officers in the Turbi police station motor vehicle to escort the appellant to Marsabit police station. The appellant complied and followed the police vehicle to Marsabit police station. PW1 and PW2 briefed the OCS on what had happened but still the appellant declined to have the motor vehicle searched. The appellant`s passengers escaped in the course of the commotion. It was the evidence of the two witnesses that it took the intervention of the DCIO and the OCPD for the appellant to open the motor vehicle and allowed it to be searched. Nothing was found in the motor vehicle. The trailer was found completely sealed with bolts. They opened the bolts. Inside the trailer the police officers found 89 bales of green plant material that they suspected to be bhang. They weighed the green plant material and an inventory was prepared. The appellant was placed in the cells. The appellant`s passengers were later arrested and the three of them were jointly charged.






5.
It was the evidence of Sgt Naibei Robert PW5 of Marsabit police station that he was on the material day at the police station when he was informed by PC Machogo PW2 that they had stopped a vehicle at KBC barrier and the driver had declined the vehicle being searched. That he joined the officers at the police yard where the DCIO also joined them. The appellant was asked to open the motor vehicle. He initially refused but he was persuaded to do so. In the trailer they found 89 bales of dry plant material. The same was weighed at 445 kg. They labelled the bales and did some sampling. A weighing certificate and a search certificate were prepared which the appellant signed. He, PW5, prepared an inventory which also the appellant signed. The appellants` passengers were that time not at the police station but they were arrested on the following day and they were jointly charged with the appellant.






6.
The case was investigated by Sgt Mohamed Abdulkadir PW7 of Marsabit police station. It was his evidence that on the material day he was at the police station when the appellant`s motor vehicle was escorted to the police station by police officers in motor vehicle registration No.GKB 501T. The escorting police officers told him that the driver of the motor vehicle had refused to have the motor vehicle inspected. They requested for assistance to have the motor vehicle searched. That the driver of the motor vehicle, the appellant caused a commotion at the police station that attracted members of the public. The appellant was saying that he is a presidential aspirant and that searching his motor vehicle amounted to harassment. That he, PW7, persuaded him to have the motor vehicle searched. The appellant opened the motor vehicle. They searched it but they did not find anything. They opened the trailer in which they found bales of polythene papers wrapped with cello tape. They removed 89 bales from the trailer. They weighed each at 5 kg, all totaling to 445 kg. They drew a search certificate, weighing certificate, an inventory and seizure notice. That the accused signed the search certificate. He was placed in the cells and later charged with the offence.






7.
It was further evidence of Sgt Abdikadir that the appellant was brought to the police station in the company of two people but they fled from the police station. That on the following day they were informed where the suspects were and they went and arrested them. They charged them jointly with the appellant.






8.
Sgt Abdikadir further testified that they established that the motor vehicle was registered jointly in the names of one Moses Mutungi and Family Bank. That the appellant had hired the motor vehicle. The owner went to court and established its ownership and it was released to him. During the hearing the witness produced the search certificate, the weighing certificate, the seizure notice, the inventory, photographs of the trailer and the motor vehicle, the Exhibit memo, the inventory, details of registration of the motor vehicle, details of the owner of the trailer and 89 samples of the green plant material as exhibits.






9.
Moses Mutungi PW3, testified that he is a businessman in Nairobi. That he was the owner of motor vehicle registration No. KCF 007Q that he bought in 2017 through financing from Family Bank. That on the 9/5/2019 he leased it to a company called Scenery Ventures Ltd. He signed an agreement of lease with the director of the company, one Monica. That on 20/6/20219 he learned from social media that the appellant had been arrested transporting bhang in the said vehicle. He called Monica and informed her. He reported the matter at Kilimani police station.






10.
Monica Musuma PW4 told the trial court that she is a tour and travel agent and a director of Scenery Ventures Ltd. That in 2019 she had hired motor vehicle registration No.KCF OO7Q from Moses Mutungi PW4. That on 12/4/2019, the appellant hired the said motor vehicle from them and made payments. He signed an agreement of lease with them. He was supposed to return the vehicle on 19/6/2019. She called him on that date but he did not pick her call. On the following day she was called by PW4 who told him that the vehicle was being detained at Marsabit police station. They came to Marsabit police station where they found the motor vehicle detained on allegations that the appellant was found transporting bhang with it.






11.
It was the evidence of James Welimo PW6, a government analyst, that on the 27/6/2019, their office received 89 khaki envelopes from Cpl Samuel Gichuki of DCI office Marsabit which contained 2087 grams of dry plant material. They were requested to ascertain whether the plant material contained narcotic drugs. He carried out physical and chemical tests on the plant material and found it to be cannabis. He signed the report. He produced the report in court as exhibit, P.Exh.18.






12.
The appellant did not offer any defence as he was not present in court during the trial.






13.
The appeal was argued by way of written submissions.








Appellant`s Submissions


14.
The appellant through his counsel submitted that the trial court failed to provide the appellant an opportunity to be heard and thus curtailed his right to adduce and challenge evidence. Hence the court condemned the appellant unheard contrary to the provisions of Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






15.
Additionally, it was submitted that the court failed to provide the appellant an opportunity be present in court during the trial and hence infringed his right to fair trial as enshrined under Article 52(2) (f) of 
the Constitution
. That there was no justification in hearing the case in the absence of the appellant and hence his constitutional rights were infringed.






16.
It was submitted that the police upon seizure of the purported drug did not comply with the mandatory procedure as set down under Section 74A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Control Act and as such a charge of trafficking in drugs was not maintainable under the Act.






17.
The appellant submitted that the trial court in the course of the trial issued a warrant of arrest against the appellant and ordered that the same be forwarded to the United Kingdom for enforcement. That the state failed to comply with the said orders and did not give any reason for failing to do so. It was submitted that the appellant was willing to be present in court but feared for his life due to numerous threats received from the police.






18.
The appellant submitted that the prosecution did not discharge its burden of proof by proving the case beyond reasonable doubt. The case of Elizabeth Waithiegeni Gatimu v Republic (2015) eKLR was cited on what it means to prove the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the trial court has a duty to weigh the prosecution evidence against the defence evidence. That in this case the defence evidence was left out and hence there was no defence evidence upon which the court could way the evidence. It was submitted that the appellant was not granted a fair trial, hence the trial was unconstitutional and illegal. The appellant urged the court to allow the appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence imposed by the trial court.








Respondent`s submissions


19.
The respondent submitted that the appellant was granted bond and deposited his passport with the court. That he later absconded court and escaped to the United Kingdom. That the trial court made a decision to continue with the case in the absence of the appellant a year after the appellant absconded upon becoming apparent that he had no intention of attending the hearing.






20.
It was submitted that the trial court was right in proceeding with the case in the absence of the appellant after he absconded. The respondent cited the case of Republic v Galma Abagaro Shano (2017) eKLR where the court found section 206 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which limited instances where the court can proceed with a criminal trial in the absence of the accused to misdemeanors was inconsistent with Article 50(2) (f) 
the constitution
 and expanded it to felonies. The court in that case ordered a murder trial to proceed in the absence of the accused who had absconded. The court cited the Ugandan case of Uganda v Gulindwa Paul and Tumusiime HCT-00-ACCM-005-2015 where it was stated that:
“
In my view, a defendant of full age and sound mind, who is properly notified of his trial and chooses to absent himself, as a result violates his obligation to attend court, deprives himself of the right to be present, and when a criminal trial proceeds in his absence, he cannot come up and claim he had been denied his constitutional rights. I hold this view because I do not think that one who voluntarily chooses not to exercise a right given to him by 
the constitution
, cannot turn around and say he has lost the benefits he might have expected to enjoy had he exercised it.”






21.
The respondent also cited the House of Lords case of Regina v Jones (2002) UKHL 5 where similar sentiments were expressed.






22.
It was submitted that the argument by the appellant that the state should have enforced the international warrant of arrest against the appellant instead of proceeding with the trial in his absence was untenable because he was aware that the court had issued warrants for his arrest and he should therefore have presented himself to court and seek for the warrants to be lifted. It was submitted that suspending the hearing indefinitely until the warrants of arrest were effected would have given the appellant opportunity to manipulate the system to his advantage.






22.
The respondent submitted that the prosecution witnesses PW 5 and 7 told the court that the sampling and weighing of the drug was done in the presence of the appellant who signed the weighing certificate, seizure notice and the inventory of he seized drugs. That though a designated analyst was not present, it was clear from the evidence of PW6 that the plant material was forwarded to him for analysis and he ascertained the same to be bhang. The respondent in this respect relied on the holding in the case of Moses Banda Daniel v Republic (2016) eKLR where the Court of Appeal stated that:
After the seizure, an expert opinion must be obtained to ascertain the nature and the weight of the drugs. This is to be done, where practicable, in the presence of the accused person, his advocate, if any, an analyst, if any appointed by the accused person and the designated analyst. The use, in the section, of phrases like “Where practicable” and “if any” convey the meaning that the procedure is not mandatory but directory and the use of the word “shall” must be so interpreted. A procedural provision would be regarded as not being mandatory if no prejudice is likely to be caused to the other party or if there is substantial compliance with the procedure.






23.
It was thus submitted that the provisions of Section 74A were substantially complied with and there is nothing to suggest that appellant was prejudiced as pertains to the recovery and handling of the seized drugs.






24.
The respondent submitted that the prosecution had proved that the appellant was found trafficking bhang by use of motor vehicle registration number KCF 007Q. That it was proved by PW4 that the appellant had hired the said vehicle from her. That the police officers PW1 and 2 proved that the appellant was found driving the said vehicle which was found hauling a trailer in which the subject drugs were found. That the same were confirmed by a government analyst PW6 to be cannabis. Therefore, that the charge against the appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent cited the case of Mohamed Famau Bakari v Republic (2016) eKLR where the Court of Appeal held that:
All forms of trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances are illicit. In terms of the provisions of sections 2(1), 4 and in view of the circumstances of this appeal we are in agreement that the appellant was trafficking by transportation. We find and hold that the offence of trafficking was proved beyond any reasonable doubt and the appellant was liable to the penalty provided for under section 4(a).






25.
The respondent submitted that the sentence under section 4(a) (ii) of the Narcotics Act where the drug is above 100 grams is a fine of not less than 50 million shillings or three times the market value of the narcotics whichever is greater or to imprisonment for a term of 50 years, or to both such fine and imprisonment.






26.
It was submitted that the value of the narcotics in this case is Ksh.11,125,000/=. That it follows that 3 times this value is Ksh.33,375,000/=. That the trial court should therefore have imposed a fine of not less than Ksh.50,000,000/=. The respondent urged the court to dismiss the appeal, uphold the conviction and impose a proper sentence.








Analysis and Determination


27.
This being a first appeal to the High Court, it is an appeal on both facts and the law. The duty of the first appellate court was succinctly captured by the Court of Appeal in Kiilu & Another V Republic, [2005] eKLR, as follows:
“
An appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusion.
It is not the function of the first appellate court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower court’s findings and conclusion; it must make its own findings and draw its own conclusion. Only then can it decide whether the magistrate’s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”






28.
The issues for determination in this appeal are whether the constitutional rights of the appellant were violated in being tried in absentia; whether section 74A of the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Control Act were complied with; whether the prosecution proved the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and whether the sentence imposed on the appellant was harsh.






29.
The appellant argued that the trial court infringed on his rights to fair trial by proceeding with the trial in his absence as a result of which he was condemned unheard without being given an opportunity to adduce evidence and to challenge the evidence adduced by the prosecution. The respondent countered this argument by stating that the appellant is the one who jumped bail. That it was proper for the trial court to proceed with the case in the absence of the appellant as he was aware of the hearing and deliberately failed to appear for the trial.






30.
Article 50 (2) (e) of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 accords an accused person the right to have the trial begin and conclude without unreasonable delay while Article 50 (2) (f) of 
the constitution
 of Kenya, 2010 provides that:
(2)
Every accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right:-
(f)
to be present when being tried, unless the conduct of the accused person makes it impossible for the trial to proceed;






31.
The record of the trial court indicates that the appellant was reported to have jumped bail in January 2020. The prosecution later made an application to the court to have the case proceed in the absence of the appellant in view of the fact that he had jumped bail. On the 2
nd
 March 2020 the trial court made a ruling in which it directed that the case proceeds in the absence of the appellant. The hearing of the case did not take off until 23/3/2021 when the 3
rd
 witness, PW3 was heard. This was more than a year after the appellant jumped bail.






32.
The appellant does not dispute that he jumped bail and went out of the jurisdiction of the trial court. The question is whether the trial court was right or erred in proceeding with the case in the absence of the appellant.






33.
The trial court in deciding to proceed with the case in the absence of the appellant relied on the decision in the Ugandan case of Uganda v Gulindwa Paul and Tumusiime (supra) as followed by the court in the Galma Abagaro Shano where it was held that it is in proper for the court to proceed with the case where an accused person has deliberately absented himself from the court. In the case of Republic - vs- Galma Abagaro Shano [2017] eKLR where the accused had jumped bail, the court observed that:-
“
...it is my considered view that the trial against the accused person must proceed in the interest of justice. It has been pending since 14
th
 October, 2015. The family of the deceased deserves justice and their rights must be considered. By absenting himself, the accused abrogated his constitutional right to be present during his trial. I therefore allow this application and direct parties to make final submissions notwithstanding the absence of the accused person to pave the way for judgment on the evidence on record.""






34.
There are a replete of authorities where courts were of similar finding that where an accused person absents himself from the hearing of a case, the case may continue in the absence of the accused. In the case of Aggrey Mbai Injaga v Republic (2014) eKLR and Republic vs Galma Abagaro Shano(2017) eKLR where the Accused escaped after he was placed to his defence, the court held that by absenting himself, the Accused had abrogated his Constitutional right to be present during trial.






35.
In the case of Republic v Teteror (Criminal Case 2 of 2017) [2023] KEHC 18592 (KLR) (15 June 2023) (Ruling) where the accused escaped from lawful custody after he had been placed to his defence on a charge of murder, the court allowed an application by the prosecution to proceed in the absence of the accused. The court in that case cited the case of Republic v Joshua Chacha Moronge [2019] eKLR, where the court in considering a relevant matter held that;
'The aim of a criminal trial is to expeditiously accord justice to all parties. An accused person found guilty of an offence ought to be accordingly sentenced in line with the law otherwise one must be acquitted forthwith. It is that balance which a trial aims to achieve. Therefore, in a case where one of the parties makes the trial unable to proceed then such a party visits an injustice to the other. That being so, a Court of law is fully enabled to deal with such instances. On one hand if the delay is occasioned by the prosecution the Court has powers to even compel the hearing to proceed. On the other hand, if the delay is occasioned by the accused person Article 50(2)(f) of 
the Constitution
 comes to play. For a Court to take refuge in Article 50(2)(f) of 
the Constitution
 and proceed on with a trial in the absence of an accused person the Court must first be satisfied that such inability to proceed with the trial is caused by the deliberate conduct of the accused person. That therefore means if the Court forms the opinion that the delay is not caused by any deliberate conduct on the part of the accused person then the trial cannot legally proceed in the absence of the accused person. To reach any of the findings, a Court must carefully consider the particular circumstances of the case. In view of the foregone I now find and hold that Article 50(2)(f) of Constitution perfectly comes to play in this case and order that the trial shall proceed the absence of the accused person notwithstanding.'






36.
It is clear from the above authorities that where an accused person absconds from the jurisdiction of the court, the trial court can proceed with the case in the absence of the accused. The appellant in this case was jointly charged with two other people. It would have been unfair to the appellant`s co-accused and against the tenets of fair trial for the case to be kept in abeyance indefinitely until when the appellant was apprehended or when he decided to turn up in court. The appellant deliberately failed to turn up in court. He cannot turn around and complain of infringement of his constitutional rights on fair trial when it is him who in the first place decided not to turn up in court for trial. His conduct made it impossible for the trial to proceed. By absenting himself from the court the appellant waived his right under Article 52 (2) (f) of 
the Constitution
. I find no substance on the argument that the trial court was in error in proceeding with the case in the absence of the appellant.






37.
The appellant further argued that the provisions of section 74A of the Criminal Procedure Code are mandatory and that they were not complied with. The section provides as follows:
“
74 A. Procedure upon seizure of narcotic drugs
(1)
Where any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance has been seized and is to be used in evidence, the Commissioner of Police and the Director of Medical Services or a police or a medical officer respectively authorized in writing by either of them for the purposes of this Act (herein referred to as “the authorized officers”) shall, in the presence of, where practicable-
(a)
the person intended to be charged in relation to the drugs (in this section referred to as “the accused person”);
(b)
a designated analyst;
(c)
the advocate (if any) representing the accused person; and
(d)
the analyst, if any, appointed by the accused person (in this section referred to as “the other analyst”), weigh the whole amount seized, and thereafter the designated analyst shall take and weigh one or more samples of such narcotic drug or psychotropic substance and take away such sample or samples for the purpose of analysing and identifying the same.”






38.
The Court of Appeal in Moses Banda Daniel v Republic (supra) interpreted the provisions of this section to mean that the procedure set out therein is not mandatory due to the use of phrases such as “where practicable” and “if any”. The court proceeded to say that the provision was more relevant where a large haul of drugs was concerned. I am in that regard duly guided by the Court of Appeal decision. The bhang in the appellant`s case was weighed by police officers in the presence of the appellant who signed the weighing certificate. The same was produced in court as exhibit. The fact that the drug was not weighed by an analyst did not cause any prejudice to the appellant. I am accordingly satisfied that the provisions of section 74A were essentially complied with.






39.
The appellant argued that the appellant was convicted on evidence that was full of contradictions and without the trial court analyzing the evidence. That the prosecution did not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.






40.
The trial magistrate in her judgment stated that there was evidence that the appellant was found hauling the trailer where the 89 bales of bhang were found. That there was sufficient evidence that the appellant was in control of the motor vehicle that was found hauling the trailer where the bhang was found. That there was evidence that the appellant had hired the motor vehicle from PW4.Therefore that possession of the bhang was proved against the appellant. That the government analyst PW6 examined the plant material and found it to be cannabis.






41.
The question was whether the appellant was found in possession of the 89 bales of cannabis. The Black`s Law Dictionary 10
th
 Edition defines the term “possession” to mean –
The fact of having or holding property in one’s power, the exercise of dominion over property. The right under which one may exercise control over something to the exclusion of all others; the continuing exercise of the claim to the exclusive use of a material object. Something that a person owns or controls.”






42.
The prosecution was therefore required to prove that the bhang was under the physical control of the appellant and that he had the knowledge of the existence of the bhang in the trailer.






43.
It was the evidence of the arresting officers PW1 and PW2 that they stopped the appellant`s vehicle and he refused to have his vehicle and trailer searched. It was their evidence that they escorted the appellant to the police station where the trailer was searched and 89 bales of bhang were found inside. It was the evidence of PC Naibei PW5 and Sgt Abdikadir PW7 that they joined the arresting officers at the police station yard where they witnessed the trailer attached to the appellant`s vehicle being searched and 89 bales were found stashed inside.






45.
I have considered the evidence that was adduced against the appellant. The evidence of the police officers as stated above was not challenged. It was clear that the appellant was found driving the subject motor vehicle that was hauling a trailer. He declined to have the vehicles searched on the basis that he was a presidential aspirant and being searched amounted to harassment. When the police stood their ground and searched the trailer, they found 89 bales of green plant material inside the trailer. Samples of the green material were sent to the government analyst PW6 who did a test on them and found them to be cannabis. There was no doubt from the evidence adduced before the trial court that the appellant was found in possession of 89 bales of cannabis. He had the physical control and knowledge of the existence of the bhang in the trailer. The only reason why the appellant could refuse to allow the police to search his motor vehicle and the trailer is that he had knowledge that there were drugs in the trailer.






46.
It is clear from the evidence adduced before the lower court that the appellant signed the search certificate, the seizure notice, the inventory and the weighing certificate after the cannabis was recovered. All these documents were produced in court as exhibits. I find overwhelming evidence that the appellant was found in possession of the cannabis.






47.
Though the appellant argued that the trial court convicted him on contradictory evidence, he did not substantiate this argument. He did not point out any contradictions in the prosecution evidence. I have not seen any contradictions in the whole of the evidence. I find that the appellant was convicted on concrete and credible evidence.






48.
The appellant was charged with trafficking in narcotic drugs. “Trafficking” is defined in section 2 of the relevant Act to mean:
…the importation, exportation, manufacture, buying, sale, giving, supplying, storing, administering, conveyance, delivery or distribution by any person of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or any substance represented or held out by such person to be a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or making of any offer in respect thereof…






49.
There was sufficient evidence that the appellant was found transporting the 89 bales of cannabis in motor vehicle registration No.KCF 007Q along Moyale/Marsabit highway. This amounted to trafficking. I find that the trial court was right in convicting the appellant for trafficking of narcotics. The conviction is therefore upheld.








Sentence


50.
The appellant argued that the sentence imposed on him was harsh. The trial magistrate sentenced the appellant to a fine of Ksh.33,375,000/= (which was three times the market value of the cannabis the accused was found in possession of) in default to serve imprisonment for a period of 5 years. In addition of the said fine, he was sentenced to serve imprisonment for a period of ten years.






51.
The Court of Appeal in Robert Mutungi Muumbi V Republic, [2015] eKLR, cited with approval its decision in Bernard Kimani Gacheru V Republic, [2002] eKLR where it held thus:
“
It is now settled law, following several authorities by this Court and by the High Court, that sentence is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trial court. Similarly, sentence must depend on the facts of each case. On appeal, the appellate court will not easily interfere with sentence unless, that sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case, or that the trial court overlooked some material factor, or took into account, some wrong material, or acted on a wrong principle. Even if, the Appellate Court feels that the sentence is heavy and that the Appellate Court might itself not have passed that sentence, these alone are not sufficient grounds for interfering with the discretion of the trial court on sentence unless, anyone of the matters already stated is shown to exist.”






52.
Section 4(a) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Control 
Act No.4 of 1994
 provides as follows:
4.
Penalty for trafficking in narcotic drugs, etc.
Any person who trafficks in, or has in his or her possession any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or any substance represented or held out by him or her to be a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance, shall be guilty of an offence and liable—
(a)
in respect of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance—
(i)
where the person is in possession of between 1—100 grams, to a fine of not less than thirty million shillings or to imprisonment for a term of thirty years, or to both such fine and imprisonment;
(ii)
where the person is in possession of more than 100 grams, to a fine of not less than fifty million shilling or three times the market value of the narcotic psychotropic substance, whichever is greater, or to imprisonment for a term of fifty years, or to both such fine and imprisonment;






53.
The appellant was found trafficking 445 Kg of cannabis. That offence falls under section 4(a) (ii) of the Act that attracts a fine of not less than fifty million shillings or three times the market value of the drug, whichever is greater. The said Act thereby imposes a minimum fine of Ksh.50 million where a person is found guilty of possession of more than 100 grams of a narcotic drug. The current jurisprudence in Kenyan Courts is that minimum sentences are unconstitutional as they take away the discretion of the court in imposing appropriate sentences in deserving cases. The trial court in this case did not impose the minimum sentence but imposed a fine that was three times the market value of the drug in default to serve 5 years imprisonment. I find the fine imposed by the trial court to have been proper and appropriate. There is no reason to interfere with it.






54.
The appellant was in addition to being fined sentenced to serve 10 years. Trafficking in drugs is a very serious offence. Consumption of drugs has the effect of destroying the health of our people. In my view, the sentence of 10 years imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances of the case, taking into consideration the quantity of drugs found with the appellant. I thereby uphold the said sentence.






55.
The upshot is therefore that this court finds no merit in the appeal. The appeal is dismissed in its entirety.

Ruling










1.
Vide an application dated 28
th
 June 2024, the Applicants herein seek orders for leave to appeal out of time and orders for stay of execution pending the hearing and determination of their intended appeal.






2.
The application was premised on the grounds on the face of the motion and the supporting affidavit sworn by Mary Ongong’a, the Advocate on record for the Applicants, on 28
th
 June 2024, wherein she averred inter alia; that the judgement and decree of the Court was issued on 22
nd
 May 2024 and that the delay in lodging an appeal against the same was occasioned by internal processes of transmission of communication of the Judgement from the advocate to the client and transmission of instructions from the client to the advocate; that this application has been filed without any delay and that any delay in filing is excusable and has been explained; that the Directline Assurance will suffer irrecoverable loss unless the order of stay of execution is issued in that should the intended appeal succeed, it will be well-nigh impossible to retrieve the decretal amount from the decree holder who has failed to reveal his financial status. She urged this Court to issue the orders sought as no prejudice will be occasioned upon the decree holder.






3.
Opposing the application, the Respondent filed grounds of opposition on 19
th
 July 2024, wherein she stated that the Applicants application is frivolous, vexatious, and scandalous and an abuse of Court process. She noted that the Applicants have not issued a detailed explanation for their delay to appeal and that the availed draft memorandum of appeal raises no arguable issues. She urged this Court to dismiss the application with costs.






4.
The application was canvassed by way of written submission. Both parties duly complied.






5.
I have considered the application for extension of time to file an appeal and stay, grounds thereof, supporting affidavit and annexures. I have also considered the grounds of opposition and submissions together with case law cited by both learned counsels.






6.
The main issue for determination is whether the Applicants have demonstrated that the orders of stay of execution pending appeal and extension of time to file their appeal are merited.






7.
The principles governing leave to appeal out of time are settled. The successful applicant must demonstrate “good and sufficient cause” for not filing the appeal in time. In Thuita Mwangi v Kenya Airways [2003] eKLR, the Court of Appeal while considering Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules which is similar to Section 79G of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, reiterated its decision in Mutiso v Mwangi [1997] KLR 630 as follows:
“
It is now well settled that the decision whether or not to extend the time for appealing is essentially discretionary. It is also well settled that generally the matters which this court takes into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are; first, the length of delay; secondly, the reason for the delay; thirdly (possibly) the chances of appeal succeeding if the application is granted; and fourthly, the degree of prejudice to the Respondent of the application is granted.”






8.
The Supreme Court in the case of Nicholas Kiptoo Korir Arap Salat Vs. IEBC and 7 Others [2014] eKLR enunciated the principles applicable in an application for leave to appeal out of time. The Court stated inter alia that:
“
The underlying principles a court should consider in exercise of such discretion include;
1.
Extension of time is not a right of any party. It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court;
2.
A party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court;
3.
Whether the court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made a case- to-case basis;
4.
Whether there is a reasonable reason for the delay. The delay should be explained to the satisfaction of the court;
5.
Whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the Respondent if the extension is granted;
6.
Whether the application has been brought without undue delay.
7.
......”






9.
It is not disputed that the judgment of the lower Court was delivered on 22
nd
 May 2024 and that the Applicants instructed their Counsel to appeal on both liability and quantum. According to the Applicant’s Counsel, the delay to file their appeal was occasioned by the communication processes between the client and the Advocate.






10.
They then filed the present application on 1
st
 July 2024 and thus the delay herein is approximately one month and one week which in my view is not inordinate.






11.
Further, while the discretion of the Court is unfettered, a successful applicant is obligated to adduce material upon which the Court should exercise its discretion, or in other words, the factual basis for the exercise of the Court’s discretion in his favor. On the question of the exercise of judicial discretion, the Supreme Court observed in the case of Telkom Kenya Limited V. John Ochanda and 996 Others [2015] eKLR that:
“
In instances where there is delay in filing the notice of appeal, this Court has inherent jurisdiction to admit such appeal, provided sufficient explanation is proffered for the cause of delay. The design and objective of the Supreme Court Rules is to ensure accessibility, fairness and efficiency in relation to this Court. Parties should comply with the procedure, rather than look to the Court’s discretion in curing the pleadings before it. This Court’s position is that the circumstances of each case are to be evaluated, as a basis for arriving at a decision to intervene, in instances where full compliance with procedure has not taken place…
It is this Court’s position of principle that prescriptions of procedure and form should not trump the primary object of dispensing substantive justice to the parties. However, the Court will consider the relevant circumstances surrounding a particular case and will conscientiously ascertain the best course.….”






12.
With regard to the request for stay of execution pending appeal, the parameters to be taken into account by the court in determining such an application are contained in Order 42 Rule 6(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules, which provides as follows –
6
(2)
No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub rule (1) unless –
a)
The court is satisfied that substantial loss may result to the applicant unless the order is made and that the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and
b)
Such security as the court orders for the due performance of such decree or order as may ultimately be binding on him has been given by the applicant.






13.
Will the Applicants suffer substantial loss if the stay orders sought are not granted? This a money decree for an amount which has been determined by the trial court and that the intended appeal is on liability and quantum. The Applicants may stand to suffer substantial loss if stay is not granted. On the other hand, on appeal on the quantum, the Respondent also stands to suffer prejudice if no amount is paid to her in the meantime. There is therefore need to balance both parties’ interest.






14.
It has not been demonstrated for instance that the Respondent may not refund the decretal sum if the Applicants are successful in their appeal. Neither has he demonstrated his pecuniary capacity. It is noted from the draft memorandum of appeal by the applicants that the appeal is solely on quantum and not on liability and hence it is obvious that the Respondent is not likely to come out empty handed at the conclusion of the appeal. I find that it is fair and just that an order that the Applicants pay half the decretal sums together with assessed costs to the Respondent while the balance be deposited into a joint interest earning account in the names of both advocates pending determination of the appeal. The applicants will be granted leave to lodge their appeal out time as well as an order for stay of execution of the decree. This arrangement takes care of the parties concerns.






15.
In view of the foregoing observations, the Applicants’ application dated 28.6.2024 is allowed in the following terms:
a)
The Applicants are hereby granted leave to file and serve their memorandum of appeal within 14 days from the date hereof.
b)
An order of stay of execution of decree in Bungoma CMCC No. 170 of 2020 pending the determination of the intended appeal is hereby granted upon the Applicants paying half the decretal sums plus assessed cost to the Respondent while the balance shall be deposited into a joint interest earning account in the joint names of both Advocates within thirty (30) days from the date hereof failing which the stay shall lapse.
c)
The costs of the application shall abide in the appeal.
Orders accordingly.

Peter Kinoti


 


Accused




and




Republic


 


Prosecutor










Sentence










1.
The Accused, Peter Kinoti was charged with Murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The particulars were that on the 3
rd
 day of September, 2021, at Maritati Location, Buuri Sub-County, within Nyeri County, murdered Florence Kawira.






2.
On inquiry by the probation department, the accused stated that on the material day the two were alone with their child in their house when he says an altercation occurred and he stabbed her with a kitchen knife. He is not forthcoming as to what exactly transpired and it is clearly something he is reluctant to discuss indicating the traumatic effects for what occurred. It must be noted that he admits to having been intoxicated from miraa and alcohol.






3.
An interview of the victim family members, specifically her parents and an older brother in a social inquiry was conducted. Clearly they are still distraught about what happened. The mother of the deceased was still grieving deeply over the loss of her daughter who was their last born in a family of five siblings.






4.
They live roughly two kilometers from the offender’s home and therefore it is a neighbour who knocked at their door to bring them the distressing news in the dead of the night on that fateful day plaguing them into emotional anguish that was only exacerbated upon their arriving to a blood-soaked scene. Nothing can repair the damage to their psyche with the mother developing hypertension from then on and being put on medication to manage the condition.






5.
Her siblings as well as the community were also thrown into shock and anger. A brother to the deceased, is said to have flushed out the offender from his hideout and subjected him to such an assault that had the offender admitted at the Nanyuki Level 5 Hospital for four days in a critical condition prior to his arrest and subsequently being charged with this offence. He still has yet to fully recover from the injuries sustained.






6.
Further to the assault on the offender, the family of the deceased also vandalized his house carting away household items and valuable documents such as title deeds to the two pieces of land that offender is a beneficiary of. This included building materials to his house, pulling down iron sheets to the three -bedroom house that offender’s aunt had built and left to him upon her demise in February 2021 a few months prior to him committing this offence.






7.
Father to victim cites that he has used over 500,000/= since the daughter’s demise and that he has taken up the upbringing of the child she left behind aged 5 years. At the time of the murder the child was aged around 2 years and is also exhibiting some trauma and could require specialized therapy which he has not yet been given as he witnessed the fatal fight.






8.
According to the report the Accused is sorry and remorseful. Only the two of them himself and the deceased know what exactly happened but he wishes he could take all that back.






9.
The history of the offender is that, after being left by his mother who left to get married, he was brought up by an aunt who took him in as she was childless. He has therefore lived his life between his grandparents’ home in Meru and Timau his Aunt’s place and she has no previous history of criminal behavior.






10.
Upon completing high school, he did odd jobs and has also worked in flower farms within Timau. The victim was his wife that he had married in 2019 and with whom they had one child together.






11.
His aunt, sister to his mother, took him in and brought him up and named him as her beneficiary of her properties within Timau and Nanyuki.






12.
Going back to the vicinity of Meru has been cited as likely to be risky in as far as his security is concerned with several neighbor’s as well as area provincial administration citing the victim’s family as extremely volatile and could react in an untoward manner toward the offender.






13.
The Probation Department would recommend that a non-custodial sanction might not be appropriate presently but could suffice in the future due to the fact that victim persons’ emotions are still raw two years down the line.






14.
The Accused faced a capital charge. A young life was needlessly lost leaving casualties behind including a 2 year old child and parents of the deceased among others.






15.
A deterrent sentence would be called for.






16.
I have however considered the mitigation put forth by counsel for the accused and further noted that the Accused has since regretted his harmful act. He has voluntarily agreed to cede and transfer a piece of land to Naftaly Kinyua of ID No. 16115476, the father of the deceased being parcel no. Nanyuki Marura Block4/288 (Kimuri) measuring 0.22 HA in an agreement signed on 11
th
 June 2024.






17.
This is in line with the plea agreement signed and accepted by the court in which he gave the undertaking to compensate the victims.






18.
The foregoing is a huge mitigating factor that would impact on the likely sentence that the Accused would face.






19.
I cannot however lose sight of the gravity of the crime. Whereas the court must in the circumstances of this case be inclined to mete out a lenient sentence, a purely non-custodial sentence would in my view be inappropriate. At the same time, the Accused has mitigated enough to deserve a lenient sentence. I note the accused has been in custody for 3 years and in line with section 333(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I have factored that period in considering the appropriate sentence.






20.
I in the circumstances sentence the accused to 3 years imprisonment. Within the initial period of the term of imprisonment the Accused is to execute the necessary documents for the transfer of the land.

          (Being an Appeal against the Judgment of Hon M W Kurumbu, Principal Magistrate, delivered on 20/4/2023 in Thika Chief Magistrate Court MCL & E Case No 18 of 2014)
        
      






Judgment










Introduction


1.
This appeal challenges the Judgment rendered on 20/4/2023 by Hon M W Kurumbu (Mrs) PM in Thika CMC E & L Case No. 18 of 2014. The key issue that fell for determination in the case was the question of ownership of land parcel number Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793 [referred to in this Judgment as “the suit property” or “the suit land”].  Lucy Wanjiru Solomon, the respondent in this appeal, was the plaintiff in the trial court. Ahmed Chege Gikera, the appellant in this appeal, was the defendant in the trial court. The trial court made a finding to the effect that the suit property belonged to the respondent and decreed the appellant to remove all his structures from the suit land within 90 days. In default, he was to be evicted from the land. Aggrieved by the Judgment, the appellant brought this appeal. The same question of ownership of the suit land is the key issue that this court, as a first appellate court, is required to determine. Before I analyse and dispose the issue, I will outline the following: (i) a brief background to the appeal; and (ii) parties’ respective submissions on the appeal.








Background


2.
The suit in the trial court was initiated by the respondent through a plaint dated 14/4/2014. She sought the following reliefs against the appellant: (i) a declaration that the suit land belonged to her; (ii) a permanent injunction restraining the appellant against occupying or erecting structures on the suit land or interfering with the suit land in any manner; (iii) an eviction order; (iv) a declaration that the appellant and those claiming title through him were trespassers on the suit land; (v) damages for trespass; and (vi) costs of the suit.






3.
The respondent’s case was that she was the registered proprietor of the suit property, having inherited it from her deceased mother, one Elizabeth Mingina Njoroge alias Anna E.N.M Njoroge [hereinafter referred to as her “the deceased”]. The respondent contended that the deceased was a shareholder in Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Ltd [hereinafter referred to as “the company”] before her death on 9/7/1992, adding that the estate of the deceased was allocated the suit property by the company. The respondent added that she and her siblings went through the process of succession after the death of their mother and a confirmed grant was issued to them on 7/4/1994. It was the respondent’s case that her deceased mother’s assets were shared amongst the beneficiaries of the estate and it was decided that the suit property be registered in her name. Consequently, upon deliberations by the board of directors, the company issued her with Ballot No. N-131 which initially belonged to one John Gichuki Thairu but had been surrendered to the company in exchange for Plot No. G.145. The respondent contended that she paid the requisite clearance fees of Kshs 4,500 on 19/1/2002. She was subsequently issued with a title deed on 26/11/2004. She later noticed the title deed contained errors which were amended and she was issued with a new title deed on 17/5/2012.






4.
The respondent contended that she was in quiet possession of the suit property until 2013 when the appellant trespassed onto the land and began constructing on it. She reported the trespass to the Area Chief who summoned the appellant and wrote to the company. The company confirmed to the Chief that the suit property belonged to the respondent. However, the appellant continued with construction on the suit property, prompting her to file Kiambu Chief Magistrate Civil Case Number 4 of 2014 against the appellant. The respondent opted to withdraw the suit from the Kiambu Chief Magistrate Court after the appellant raised the issue of geographical jurisdiction. The respondent thereafter filed a fresh suit at the Thika Chief Magistrate Court, to wit, Thika Chief Magistrate Court E & L Case No 18 of 2014 which culminated in the present appeal.






5.
The appellant entered appearance and subsequently filed a defence dated 19/5/2014 in the suit. He denied the respondent’s contention that she was the owner of the suit land, adding that the suit land was never one of the assets of the deceased. He urged the court to dismiss the respondent’s suit. He did not, however, bring any counterclaim to impeach the title held by the respondent.






6.
Upon conclusion of trial, and upon receipt of submissions, the trial court rendered the impugned Judgment in which it found that the respondent had proved her case against the appellant on the balance of probabilities. The trial court granted the respondent the reliefs sought in the plaint, including costs of the suit. The trial court assessed and awarded the respondent general damages for trespass in the sum of Kshs 100,000.








Appeal


7.
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the trial court, the appellant brought this appeal, advancing the following five (5) verbatim grounds:
1.
The learned magistrate herein having not conducted the dispute between the appellant and the respondent herein completely misunderstood the dispute hence arrived at an erroneous judgment. [sic]
2.
That the learned magistrate failed to appreciate that both parties herein claimed to have bought the suit property from a one Samuel Chuchu, but that the said Samuel Chuchu appeared before the honourable court and confirmed that he sold the suit property to the appellant herein.
3.
That the learned magistrate failed to understand that the suit property was never subject to succession proceedings and that the land that was subject to succession proceedings was different from the land the Samuel Chuchu sold the to the appellant herein [sic].
4.
That the learned magistrate herein failed to appreciate that Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Limited allocated to the respondent herein property that belonged to Samuel Chuchu which property the said Chuchu had already sold to the appellant herein.
5.
That the learned magistrate failed in law and fact when she relied on irrelevant documents of ownership from the respondent, in particular the learned magistrate failed in law and fact in not finding that parties in the succession dispute including a one Hon. Cecilia Githua, sister of the respondent herein were never called as witnesses to confirm the issues of the land dispute.






8.
The appellant prayed for the following reliefs from this court: (i) an order allowing the appeal; (ii) an order overturning the Judgment of the trial court; (iii) a declaration that the appellant is the bonafide registered owner of the suit land; (iv) an order dismissing the respondent’s suit in the trial court; (v) an order condemning the respondent to bear costs of the appeal.








Appellant’s Submissions


9.
The appeal was canvassed through written submissions dated 13/10/2023, filed by M/s Prof. Kiama Wangai & Company Advocates. Counsel for the appellant contended that the respondent was never the owner of the suit property. Counsel further contended that the suit property was never part of the estate of the respondent’s deceased mother. Counsel submitted that the respondent’s witness, one John Maina Mburu, testified that John Gichuki Thairu bought the suit property from Samuel Chuchu Njoroge on 8/11/2002 and that he was later compensated with Plot No. G145 upon surrendering it to the company for it to be allocated to the respondent’s deceased mother. Counsel further submitted that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge testified as the appellant’s witness and stated that he sold his land to the appellant. Counsel argued that on the basis of the aforementioned testimony, the respondent’s claim ought to have failed. Counsel added that the respondent together with her witnesses were not truthful.






10.
Counsel faulted the extracts of the register of the company tendered by the respondent as evidence during trial. Counsel contended that the extracts of the register did not indicate that the respondent’s deceased mother owned Plots No. N131, 132 and/or 133. Counsel further contended that the respondent’s deceased mother’s name did not appear in the extracts of the register tendered. Counsel faulted the respondent for not calling John Gichuki Thairu as a witness, adding that the evidence of Samuel Chuchu Njoroge remained unchallenged.






11.
Counsel for the appellant referred to affidavits dated 23/1/2014 and 27/2/2014 filed by the respondent in Kiambu Chief Magistrate Court Civil Suit No. 4 of 2014 where the respondent averred that she bought the suit property from the company. Counsel argued that the respondent lied, adding that she initially stated that she bought the suit property but later contended that she inherited the suit property from her deceased mother.






12.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was not in dispute that the suit property initially belonged to Samuel Chuchu Njoroge. Counsel added that the fact in dispute was the question as to whom Samuel Chuchu Njoroge transferred the suit property. Counsel added that the respondent’s case was that the suit property was transferred to John Gichuki Thairu while the appellant’s case was that the suit property was transferred to him. Counsel argued that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge confirmed through his testimony during trial that he sold the suit property to the appellant. Counsel further argued that none of the documents tendered by the company contained the name of the respondent’s deceased mother, adding that the respondent did not lead evidence to demonstrate that her deceased mother ever owned land in the scheme. Counsel added that the basis of the claim by the respondent was fraudulent.






13.
In conclusion, counsel submitted that having demonstrated that the respondent’s deceased mother did not own land from the company, it followed that the title deed the respondent possessed was obtained through fraud. Counsel further submitted that the appellant clearly demonstrated that he bought the suit property from Samuel Chuchu Njoroge who was recognized as the initial owner of the suit land. Counsel faulted the trial court for failing to interrogate the roots of the title that the respondent claimed to have. Counsel urged the Court to grant the appellant the orders sought in the appeal.








Respondent’s Submissions


14.
The respondent opposed the appeal through written submissions dated 20/11/2023, filed by C W Ngala & Company Advocates. On the appellant’s contention that the trial magistrate completely misunderstood the dispute and arrived at an erroneous Judgment, counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no law that barred a competent magistrate with jurisdiction against writing a judgment in a matter where he or she did not conduct the trial, adding that the learned magistrate got seized of the case because the previous magistrate was transferred. Counsel further submitted that the appellant, through his notice of motion application dated 21/8/2019, objected to the judgment being written by the previous magistrate (Hon. C. A Omondi (SPM)). Counsel submitted that the appellant’s claim that Hon. M. W Kurumbu (PM), who wrote the impugned Judgment, misunderstood the dispute was baseless, adding that all the trial records, including typed proceedings, were available.






15.
On the contention that the learned magistrate failed to appreciate that both parties claimed to have bought the suit land from Samuel Chuchu Njoroge, counsel submitted that the respondent never stated that she bought the suit property from Samuel Chuchu Njoroge. Counsel further submitted that the appellant completely misunderstood the respondent’s evidence. Counsel added that the respondent stated that she acquired the suit property from the company as a result of the shares her deceased mother held, which entitled the deceased to 1 ¼ acres plus 1/8 acre plot. Counsel contended that the lower court clearly understood the respondent’s case and summarized it in its Judgment, adding that the respondent led evidence on how she acquired the suit land. Counsel further submitted that the respondent’s evidence was supported by PW3, John Maina Mburu, the chairman of the company that owned the subdivision scheme, who explained that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge sold the suit property to John Gichuki Thairu who later surrendered it to the company and the company subsequently re-allocated the land to the beneficiary of the estate of the late Elizabeth Mingina Njoroge. Counsel submitted that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge had no capacity to resell Plot No. N131 on 10/03/2003 because he had already sold it to John Thairu Gichuki on 8/10/2002 in the presence of an advocate. Counsel further submitted that the subsequent sale vide the sale agreement dated 10/03/2003 was fraudulent, adding that the agreement was not witnessed by an advocate nor dated.






16.
On the contention that the learned magistrate failed to appreciate that the suit property was never the subject of succession proceedings, counsel submitted that what was before the High Court in the Succession proceedings were the shares held in the company by the respondent’s deceased mother, which entitled her to 1 ¼ acres plus 1/8 acre plot. Counsel added that the records produced in court by PW3, John Maina Mburu [the chairman of the company], clearly showed that it was the deceased’s shares and Ballot No. N-131 which translated to Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793. Counsel faulted the appellant for relying on the affidavit sworn by the respondent in Kiambu Chief Magistrate Civil Case Number 4 of 2014. Counsel argued that the appellant objected to the said suit on the ground of geographical jurisdiction, adding that as a result, the respondent withdrew the suit and filed a fresh suit at the Thika Chief Magistrate Court. Counsel argued that the idea of plucking affidavits made in different proceedings was an abuse of the process of court. Counsel added that the issues in the lower court were framed based on the pleadings before it.






17.
On the contention that the learned magistrate failed to appreciate that the company allocated to the respondent property that belonged to Samuel Chuchu Njoroge and which Samuel Chuchu Njoroge had sold to the appellant, counsel submitted that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge could not have legitimately sold the suit property to the appellant in 2003 given that Samuel Chuchu Njoroge had already sold the suit property to John Thairu Gichuki in 2002. Counsel further submitted that PW3, John Maina Mburu, the chairman of the company produced the relevant register during trial and conclusively testified on the origin of Ballot No. N131.






18.
On the allegation that the learned magistrate relied on irrelevant documents of ownership from the respondent, counsel submitted that the allegation had no legal basis and was pegged on malice. Counsel further submitted that the respondent was a title holder prior to the invasion of the suit property by the appellant. Counsel added that there was no dispute between the respondent’s siblings over the distribution of their deceased mother’s estate to warrant their appearance in court to testify. Counsel argued that nothing prevented the appellant from taking out witness summons to summon any party to testify. Counsel further argued that the evidence led by the respondent in the lower court was satisfactory.






19.
Counsel added that the appellant neither challenged the respondent’s title which he was aware of since 2004 nor filed a counterclaim against the respondent. In conclusion, counsel urged the Court to uphold the decision of the lower court and award the costs of the appeal to the respondent.








Analysis and Determination


20.
I have read and considered the original record of the trial court; the record filed in this appeal; the grounds of appeal; and the parties’ respective submissions. I have also considered the relevant legal frameworks and jurisprudence. The key issue to be determined in this appeal is the question as to who is the legitimate owner of land parcel number Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793. Before I analyse and dispose the issue, I will outline the principle that guides this court when exercising appellate jurisdiction.






21.
This is a first appeal. The task of a first appellate court was summarized by the Court of Appeal in the case of Susan Munyi v Keshar Shiani (2013) eKLR as follows:
“
As a first appellate court our duty of course is to approach the whole of the evidence on record from a fresh perspective and with an open mind. We are to analyze, evaluate, assess, weigh, interrogate and scrutinize all of the evidence and arrive at our own independent conclusions.”






22.
The principle was similarly outlined in Abok James Odera t/a A. J Odera & Associates v John Patrick Machira t/a Machira & Co Advocates [2013] eKLR as follows:
“
This being a first appeal, we are reminded of our primary role as a first appellate court, namely, to re-evaluate, re-assess and re-analyse the extracts on the record and then determine whether the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge are to stand or not and give reasons either way.”






23.
Who is the legitimate owner of land parcel number Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793? There was common ground that the suit land is located in a subdivision scheme that belongs to Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Ltd [referred to in this Judgment as “the company”]. The company subdivided the block of land and was responsible for conveying the subdivisions to its eligible shareholders.






24.
The respondent went to the trial court waving a registered title conveyed to her by the company. The title was issued to her on 26/11/2004 and re-issued on 17/5/2012. The re-issuance was effected to correct a typographical error relating to her ID card number. She led evidence that her mother who died in 1992 was an eligible shareholder of the company. She inherited the portion of her mother’s shares that translated to the suit land while her other siblings inherited the portions that translated to other lands that her deceased mother was entitled to within the scheme. It was her evidence that subsequent to the death of her mother, they carried out succession and she was given the suit land. Together with her sister, they subsequently approached the company for their deceased mother’s land. They were asked to pay the requisite sums which she paid. With the consent of her sister, the company cleared her and caused a title to be processed, registered and issued to her in 2004. She was in quiet possession of the suit land until 2013 when the appellant emerged and placed building stones on the land. This prompted her to challenge the appellant’s actions through court proceedings.






25.
The respondent led evidence from, among other witnesses, the Chairman of Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Ltd, Mr. John Maina Mburu, who testified as PW3. His evidence was that the company allocated the suit land to the respondent who was the entitled beneficiary of the estate of the late Elizabeth Mingina Njoroge. He also confirmed that the company cleared the respondent and facilitated the processing of the title held by the respondent. It was the evidence of the Chairman that the records held by the company showed that the suit land had initially been assigned to one Samuel Chuchu Njoroge who subsequently sold his corresponding shares to John Gichuki Thairu. When the company realized there was duplication of the corresponding ballot, it allocated John Gichuki Thairu a different parcel of land and retained the respondent as the proprietor of the land. It proceeded to clear the respondent and facilitated the processing of the respondent’s title.






26.
The Chairman (PW 3) tendered as evidence, an affidavit sworn by Samuel Chuchu Njoroge on 21/10/2015, in which the deponent confirmed on oath that he had sold his interest to John Gichuki Thairu. For the avoidance of doubt, the affidavit by Samuel Chuchu Njoroge reads as follows:-
“
I Samuel Chuchu Njoroge do hereby make oath and states as follows:-
1.
That I am a male adult of sound mind hence capable and competent to swear this affidavit.
2.
That I am a Kenyan citizen and the legal holder of Identity Card Number xxxxx.
3.
That on or about 8th October 2002 I sold plot No.Ruiru/kiu Block 2/4793 contained in share certificate No. 8184 and held by ballot No N131 in the undertaking company commonly known as Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Ltd to John Githuki Thairu ID No xxxx.
4.
That I surrendered the original share certificate, Ballot and all other documents to the said John Githuki Thairu hence I surrendered all interest over the said plot to him.
5.
That I swear this affidavit to affirm that I sold the said plot to John Githuki Thairu.
6.
That I am ready to indemnify Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company Ltd and the Government of Kenya if the same is found to be false or for any loss arising there from.
7.
That I swear this affidavit in accordance with the oath and statutory declaration believing the same is true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.”






27.
The above affidavit was produced as Plaintiff Exhibit No. 24. At the time Samuel Chuchu Njoroge testified as DW2, the above affidavit had been tendered by PW3. Samuel Chuchu Njoroge elected to say nothing by way of evidence on the above affidavit. Consequently, the depositions in the above affidavit tendered by the Chairman of the company remained uncontroverted.






28.
What case and evidence did the appellant present to the trial court? First, the appellant presented a defence dated 19/5/2014 in which he denied the respondent’s contention that she was the registered owner of the suit land. He urged the trial court to dismiss the respondent’s suit. He stopped at that. He did not bother to impeach the respondent’s title through a counterclaim. Secondly, despite being made aware that the suit land had been allotted to the beneficiary of the estate of Elizabeth Mingina Njoroge by the company that owned the subdivision scheme, he did not bother to join the company as a party to the cause through a counterclaim. Consequently, at the point the dispute fell for determination, the respondent’s registered title had not been impeached by the appellant through a counterclaim. Clearly, without a counterclaim and without proof of the counterclaim, the trial court was bound by the framework in Section 26 of the 
Land Registration Act
 which provides as follows:-
“
26.Certificate of title to be held as conclusive evidence of proprietorship
1.
The certificate of title issued by the Registrar upon registration, or to a purchaser of land upon a transfer or transmission by the proprietor shall be taken by all courts as prima facie evidence that the person named as proprietor of the land is the absolute and indefeasible owner, subject to the encumbrances, easements, restrictions and conditions contained or endorsed in the certificate, and the title of that proprietor shall not be subject to challenge, except—
a.
on the ground of fraud or misrepresentation to which the person is proved to be a party; or
b.
where the certificate of title has been acquired illegally, unprocedurally or through a corrupt scheme.
2.
A certified copy of any registered instrument, signed by the Registrar and sealed with the Seal of the Registrar, shall be received in evidence in the same manner as the original.”






29.
In his evidence, the appellant alleged that he purchased the suit land from Samuel Chuchu Njoroge on 10/3/2003. Asked about the exact date when he learnt that the respondent had been issued with a title relating to the suit land, the appellant stated thus:
“
I learnt that the plaintiff had been issued a title 
on 2004/2005
. I have never filed a case against the plaintiff challenging her title.”






30.
The evidence in the preceding paragraph was given by the appellant during cross-examination on 28/1/2019. It is clear from the evidence that despite the appellant knowing that the land-allocating company had cleared the respondent and caused a title relating to the suit land to be issued to the respondent, he elected to do nothing in terms of challenging the respondent’s title. Under Section 7 of the 
Limitation of Actions Act
, any cause of action which the appellant had against the respondent’s title stood statute-barred upon expiry of 12 years reckoned from 2004/2005.






31.
That is not all. Whereas Samuel Chuchu Njoroge testified as DW2, he elected to say nothing about the affidavit dated 21/10/2015 [Plaintiff Exhibit No 24] that was attributed to him, in which he unequivocally confirmed to the company that owned the subdivision scheme that he had sold his shares together with the corresponding land [the suit land] to John Gichuki Thairu. He also elected to say nothing about the sale agreement [Exhibit No. 21] attributed to him, dated 8/10/2002 through which he sold the suit land to John Gichuki Thairu. The Chairman of the company tendered the agreement as proof of Samuel Chuchu Njoroge’s disposal of his shares together with the corresponding land [the suit land] to John Gichuki Thairu.






32.
From the above evidence, it is clear that the appellant did not impeach the respondent’s title by way of pleadings and evidence. It is also clear that the respondent proved the legitimacy of her title on the balance of probabilities.






33.
The appellant placed reliance on the use of the word “bought” instead of “inherited” in a preceding affidavit in a suit that was withdrawn by the respondent. A perusal of the original record of the trial court reveals that the respondent addressed this issue in her evidence and explained that there was an inadvertent error on the part of her advocate who drew the previous affidavit. She was categorical that she acquired the suit land through inheritance. Her evidence was corroborated by the Chairman of the land-buying company that owned the subdivision scheme.






34.
On his part, the appellant deliberately misled the Court that he was the Chairman of the land-buying company at the time of testifying in 2019. He did not present any signed CR Form or court order to controvert the CR Form and the Court Order that John Mburu Maina [PW 3] had tendered as evidence.






35.
Lastly, in his memorandum of appeal, the appellant prayed for a declaration that he is the bonafide registered owner of the parcel of land known as Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793. There was no such plea before the trial court. Having failed to plead a counterclaim, it is too late in the day to ask for a relief of this nature from an appellate court.






36.
For the above reasons, this court finds that the respondent, Lucy Wanjiru Solomon, properly proved that she was the legitimate registered proprietor of land parcel number Ruiru/Kiu Block 2/4793. Consequently, this court has no proper basis to fault the lower court. The result is that this appeal is dismissed for lack of merit.






37.
No proper basis has been laid to warrant a departure from the general rule in Section 27 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
. It therefore follows that the appellant will bear costs of this appeal.

Judgment










1.
In 2015, the National Assembly enacted the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
 2015 (PPADA) to implement article 227 (2) of 
the Constitution
. The Act came into force on 7
th
 January 2016.






2.
On 22
nd
 April 2020, the cabinet Secretary, National Treasury and Planning (CS Treasury) gazetted the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations 2020 (the Regulations) through Legal Notice No. 69 published in the Gazette Notice No.4952.






3.
The National Assembly considered, approved and adopted the Regulations. They were then published in Legal Notice No. 53 dated 9
th
 July 2020 on 24
th
 July 2020 and came into operation.






4.
The petitioner filed this petition challenging the constitutionality of regulation 202 (2) (d) on grounds that the filing fees to be paid when making a request for review before the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (the Board) is exorbitant, unreasonable and without legal justification.






5.
According to the petitioner, tenderers with low tender sums stand to suffer as fees of 10% of the tender sums (of not more than Kshs. 2,000,000) will, in effect, shut out genuine grievances on account of inability to raise the fees. This, the petitioner argue, is contrary to national values and principles in Articles 10 and 227 of 
the Constitution
.






6.
The petitioner further argues that fees based on a percentage of the tender sum is not only discriminatory against tenderers with low sums, but also converts justice into a commodity for sale in so far as procurement challenges are concerned, a violation of Articles 48 and 50 of 
the Constitution
.






7.
It is also unfair and discriminatory to the extent that tenderers with larger sums do not suffer the same prejudice. They are required to pay up to Kshs. 200,000, while bidders with tenders amounting to millions of shillings are required to pay only Kshs. 250,000. This offends Articles 27, 47 and 48 of 
the Constitution
. The petitioner maintains that it is unreasonable to set fees at 10% yet the bid bond security is not more than 2%.






8.
The petitioner takes the view, that there is no reasonable basis for the impugned regulation to treat people differently based on their financial standing. It has the effect of unfair treatment and discrimination based on social origin, financial and socio-economic status contrary to Articles 27(1), (2), (4) & (5) and 159(2) (a) of 
the Constitution
.






9.
The petitioner asserts, that the impugned regulation contravenes the legitimate expectation of the public and denies the public the right to equal protection of the law guaranteed under Articles 22(1), 25(c), 48 and 50(1) of 
the Constitution
. The petitioner maintains that the fees imposed by the impugned regulation will deter persons with legitimate grievances and make it impossible to lodge procurement complaints, thereby defeating the purpose of section 167 of the Act and the Board. It will also give procuring entities and accounting officers unfettered powers over procurement matters without any form of control or regulation, contrary to the objectives of Article 227 and section 28 of the Act.






10.
The petitioner takes the position, that the impugned regulation limits the right to a fair hearing before a court or independent tribunal guaranteed in Articles 50 and 10 of 
the Constitution
 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, respectively. The regulation has the further effect of rendering Article 227 of 
the Constitution
 and the safeguards of procurement under the Act ineffective thus, unlawfully depriving courts and independent tribunals their oversight role in procurement matters.






11.
The petitioner posits, that the impugned regulation fails to meet the requirement under Article 24(d) of 
the Constitution
 as it fails to strike a balance between the right of access to justice and need to prevent frivolous applications challenging procurement processes. The petitioner takes the view, that the regulation contravenes Articles 21(3), 55(b) and 56(b) of 
the Constitution
, discriminates against the youth and marginalised in society.






12.
The petitioner relies on, among others, the decisions in Kenya Human Rights Commission v Attorney General & another [2018] eKLR; Tukero Ole Kina v Attorney General & another [2019] eKLR; Paul Pkiach Anupa & Another v Attorney General & another (2012) eKLR; Okenyo Omwansa George & Another v Attorney General &2 others [2012] eKLR and Kenya Bus Service Ltd & another v Minister for Transport & 2 others [2012] eKLR.






13.
Regarding the respondents’ argument that the regulation challenged does not sexist, the petitioner submits that reference to regulation 202 (2) (d) as the impugned regulation, was inadvertently and erroneous. It should have read regulation 203(2)(d). He urges that that the error be cured under Article 159(2) (d) of 
the Constitution
. The petitioner relies on Albert Mburu Karinga v Peter Mambo Karinga & another [2014] eKLR and urges the court to consider any reference to regulation 202 (2)(d) as reference to regulation 203(2) (d). The petitioner maintains, therefore, that the matter is properly before the court.






14.
The petitioner further argues that the doctrine of exhaustion does not apply, as he is not exclusively required to exhaust the remedy in Article 119 (1) of 
the Constitution
 (presenting a petition to Parliament) before filing a constitutional petition before this court to challenge the constitutionality of the regulation.






15.
The petitioner relies on County Assembly Forum & 6 others v Attorney General & 2 others; Senate of the Republic of Kenya (Interested Party) [2021] eKLR and Council of Governors & 3 others v Senate & 53 others [2015] eKLR.






16.
Responding to the argument that the filing fees imposed under regulation 203(2) (d) are necessary for purposes of public interest, the petitioner argues that this is problematic because it is an outright discrimination against people of lower economic and bars them from enjoying their right to fair administrative action contrary to Article 48 of 
the Constitution
.






17.
The petitioner maintains that he has demonstrated that the fees imposed in the Fifteenth Schedule to the Regulations in accordance with regulation 203(2) (d) are unreasonable and impede access to justice due to the exorbitance and inequitable application.






18.
The petitioner posits, therefore, that what is in contention is the law and not the policy as claimed. He maintains that the regulation contravenes various Articles of 
the Constitution
 and as such it should be declared unconstitutional, null and void.






19.
Based on the above arguments, the petitioner seeks a declarations that Regulation 202(2) (d) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations 2020 is unconstitutional and therefore null and void; An order of permanent injunction permanently restraining and staying the operation and implementation of Regulation 202(2) (d) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations 2020; an order suspending Regulations 202(2) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations 2020 to the extent that it affects assessment of fees of the repealed regulations and such other or further orders as the court may deem just and appropriate in the circumstances. The petitioner also prayed for costs






Respondents’ and 1st interested party’s case


20.
The respondents and 1
st
 interested party oppose the petition through replying affidavits and written submissions. They contend that since the coming into force of the impugned regulation, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of review cases filed, especially in respect to bidders with low tender sums. They associated themselves fully with the submissions filed by the 3
rd
 interested party.








3rd interesting party’s case


21.
The 3
rd
 interested party has opposed the petition through grounds of opposition. The 3
rd
 interested party contends that the petition is misconceived as the petitioner has failed to demonstrate the how regulation 202(2) (d) (which does not exist) violates 
the Constitution
; that the petitioner did not amend the petition to indicate the correct regulation challenged, thus, the petition is a non-starter.






22.
Regarding the unconstitutionality of regulation 203 (2) (d), the 3
rd
 interested party argues that the petitioner does not impugn the process of enacting this regulation: Rather, he takes issue with the amount of filing fees required to be paid by litigants which is a policy issue that falls outside the purview of this court’s jurisdiction. It is the 3
rd
 interested party’s case, that the impugned regulation should not be construed in isolation, but be read with sections 167 to 175 of the Act (Part XV), and articles 159, 48, 47, 50 and 227 of 
the Constitution
.






23.
According to the 3
rd
 interested party, the rationale for the security and the timelines imposed under the impugned regulation, is that once the procurement dispute resolution mechanism established under Part XV of the Act is engaged, the procurement entity is required, under section 168, to suspend the procurement proceedings pending conclusion of the dispute resolution process.






24.
It is the 3
rd
 interested party’s further case, that various statutes impose strict timelines and conditions for the carrying out of certain matters and that this does not amount to a violation of Constitution or the Bill of Rights. If aggrieved, the right avenue would be, first; to petition Parliament under Article 119 of 
the Constitution
 read with the Petitions to Parliament (Procedure) Act, 2012 for review of the impugned provision, including the entire Part XV of the Regulations.






25.
The 3
rd
 interested party asserts that the petitioner has not shown litigants who have been locked out of the dispute resolution process for failure to meet the fees set in the impugned regulation. The petition does not also meet the test set in Anarita Karimi v Republic [1979] eKLR.






26.
The 3
rd
 interested party relies on Article 119 of 
the Constitution
, the Petitions to Parliament (Procedure) Act 2012 and decisions in Samuel Kamau Macharia v Kenya Commercial Bank & 2 others [2011] eKLR;  In the Matter of the National Land Commission [2015] eKLR;  Pevans East Africa Limited & another v Chairman, Betting Control & Licensing Board & 7 others [2017] eKLR; Tinyefuza vs Attorney General of Uganda Constitutional Petiti

 [1997] 3 UGCC; In the Matter of Kenya National Commission on Human Rights [2014] eKLR; Mohammed Abduba Dida v Debate Media Limited & another [2018] eKLR and Katiba Institute v Attorney General & 9 others [2020] eKLR. It urges that the petition be dismissed with costs. In the event the court decides otherwise, it should remit regulation 203 (2) (d) back to Parliament for consideration.








Determination


27.
This petition challenges the constitutionality of regulation 202(2) (d) of the Regulations. The Regulations were placed before the National Assembly for consideration and were and adopted. They were then published by the CS Treasury in the Kenya Gazette thus, came into operation.






28.
Following this development, the petitioner filed this petition challenging the constitutionality of regulation 202 (2) (d) on grounds that the filing fees to be paid when applying for review before the Board, is exorbitant, unreasonable and without legal justification, for introducing a percentage of fees to be paid when challenging tendering processes.






29.
Before dealing with the issue, it is important to briefly consider the principles that guide courts in determining constitutionality of statutes or statutory provisions.






30.
First; is a general, but rebuttable presumption principle that a court should presume a statute or a statutory provision enacted by the legislature to be constitutional, unless the law is clearly unconstitutional or violates a fundamental right. The burden is, however, on the person alleging unconstitutionality to prove the invalidity. This is because it is assumed that the legislature, as the people’s representative, understands the problems people face and, therefore, enacts legislations with the intention of solving the problems. (See Hamdarada Nakhana Union of India Air [1960] 354).






31.
The principle was restated in Ndynabo v Attorney General of Tanzania [2001] EA 495, that an Act of Parliament is presumed constitutional and that the burden is on the person who contends otherwise to prove the contrary.






32.
Second; the court should examine the purpose or effect of a statute. The purpose of enacting a legislation, or the effect of implementing such legislation, may lead to nullification of the statute or its provision if found to be inconsistent with 
the constitution
. In R v Big M. Drug Mart Ltd, [1985] 1 SCR 275; 1986 LRC (Const.) 332, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:
“
[80] Both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality; either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate legislation. All legislation is animated by an object the legislature intends to achieve. The object is realized through impact produced by the operation and applications of the legislation. Purpose and effect respectively, in the sense of the legislation’s object and ultimate impact, are clearly limited, but indivisible. Intended and achieved effect have been looked to for guidance in ascertaining the legislation’s object and thus, its validity.""






33.
The Court was clear that the initial test of constitutionality must be whether or not the legislation's purpose is valid; the legislation's effect needs only to be considered when the law under review has passed the purpose test. The effect test can never be relied on to save legislation with an invalid purpose.






34.
In Olum and another v Attorney General [2002] EA, the court again stated thus:
“
To determine the constitutionality of a section of a statute or Act of parliament, the Court has to consider the purpose and effect of the impugned statute or section thereof. If its purpose does not infringe a right guaranteed by 
the Constitution
, the Court has to go further and examine the effect of the implementation. If either its purpose or the effect of its implementation infringes a right guaranteed by 
the Constitution
, the impugned statute or section thereof shall be declared unconstitutional.""






35.
The same point was made in Centre for Rights Education and Awareness & another v John Harun Mwau & 6 others [2012] eKLR, that in determining whether a statute is constitutional or not, the court must determine the object and purpose of the impugned Act, and this can be discerned from the intention expressed in the Act itself.






36.
The petitioner’s concern, as I understand it, is that tenderers with low tender sums will be required to pay a fee of 10% of the tender sums (where the tender sum is not more than Kshs. 2,000,000). This will most likely shut out genuine grievances from being placed before the Board as many would be challengers will not raise the fees. This, the petitioner argues, is contrary to national values and principles in Articles 10 and 227 of 
the Constitution
. The petition, therefore, challenges the constitutionality of regulation 202 (2) (d) and seeks a declaration that this regulation is unconstitutional null and void and an order of permanent injunction restraining and staying the operations and implementation of the regulation.






37.
The respondents and the interested parties argue that the impugned regulation (202 (2)(d)) does not exist. In that respect, they contend, the petitioner having not amended his petition, the declarations are sought against a non-existent regulation and cannot be granted.






38.
As is clear from the pleadings and submissions by parties, the reliefs sought in the petition target regulation 202(2) (d) that it is constitutionally infirm and a stop to its implementation.






39.
The petitioner argues that the effect of the regulation is to deny those aggrieved from challenging the tender processes. The petitioner further argues that the regulation has a discriminatory effect in that tenders of high value/money will pay less in terms of filing fees than those with less tender amount.






40.
I have carefully gone through the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations 2020. The Regulations do not have regulation 202(2)(d). First, regulation 202 (2) does not even have clauses, let alone clause(d). In that regard, as correctly submitted by the respondents and interested parties, the regulation challenged does not exist. Second, regulation 202 according to the marginal note, is on “Disposal to employees” thus, has nothing to do with fees.






41.
The petitioner’s petition and written submissions addressed the non-existent regulation. However, the Supplementary submissions seemed to change course and addressed regulation 203(2)(d). In the supplementary submissions, the petitioner urges that reference to regulation 202(2)(d) was erroneous and such reference should be deemed to be with regard to regulation 203(2)(d).






42.
There is no denial that the regulation challenged does not exist. This fact is admitted by the petitioner who submits that reference to regulation 202(2)(d) was inadvertent and erroneous. Despite this admission, the petitioner did not seek to amend his petition to bring forth the correct regulation he challenges. His only attempt was urge through written submissions that reference to regulation 202 (2) (d) as the impugned regulation was inadvertent and erroneous and any reference to regulation 202(2)(d) should read to refer to regulation 203(2)(d). The petitioner argues that the error is curable under Article 159(2) (d) of 
the Constitution
.






43.
The law is settled that parties are bound by their pleadings. A party cannot change or amend pleadings through submissions since submissions are not pleadings, but arguments. The petitioner had an opportunity to amend his petition to correct the error but did not do so. Even during the hearing when parties were highlighting their submissions, he did not even make an oral application for leave of court to amend the petition to correct the error. He urges through submissions that any reference to regulation 202(2)(d) should be taken to be reference to regulation 203 (2)(d).






44.
When a party discovers an error in his pleadings and thinks there is need to amend the pleadings to correct the error, he ought to notify the court of the intention to amend the pleadings and take steps to seek leave where required. An application for leave can be made orally and the court would give the respondent an opportunity to state whether he opposes the request or not. The court would then decide whether to allow the oral request or ask the party to file a formal application to give the other side an opportunity to respond. This is so in this ace bearing in mind that respondents had already filed responses to the petition. The petitioner did not do so.






45.
The petitioner again argues that the error can be cured under Article 159(2) (d) of 
the Constitution
. Article 159 (2) (d) provides that justice shall be administered without undue regard to “procedural”technicalities. The Article talks about technicalities of procedure. The issue raised here is that the regulation challenged does not exist. This is not a procedural technicality but a substantive issue that goes to the root of the matter. Where a provision challenged for being unconstitutional does not exists, that is not a procedural technicality as the petitioner wants the court to believe but a substantive issue that affects the substratum of the petition.






46.
In Kiu & another v Khaemba & 3 others [2021] KECA 318 (KLR), R N Nambuye, JA. observed that the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 is unfettered especially where procedural technicalities pose an impediment to the administration of justice, However, Article 159(2)(d) is not a panacea for all procedural ills.






47.
In Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliamce & 5 others [2013] eKLR, the Court of Appeal stated that it is a misconception to claim that compliance with rules of procedure is antithetical to Article 159 of 
the Constitution
 and the overriding objective principle under section 1A and 1B of the 
Civil Procedure Act
. It is not in doubt that the courts were referring to procedural infirmities but not substantive aspects of the cases.






48.
The petitioner having discovered that the regulation he challenged in his petition did not exist, was under obligation to take steps to correct the error through an amendment to bring forth the correct regulation under challenge. The defect in the rule challenged not being procedural infirmity, has a serious effect on the competence of the petition with the result that it makes the petition untenable. I say so, because the averments in the petition; depositions in the supporting affidavit and arguments in the written submissions all make reference to regulation 202(2)(d). further, the reliefs are a declaration that regulation 202(2)(d) is unconstitutional and an order staying implementation of that particular regulation.






49.
Without amendments to the petition, it denied the respondents and interested parties an opportunity to respond to the correct provision given that they had already filed their responses. Proceeding in the manner the petitioner urges, by assuming that the provision challenged is not that in the pleadings but a different one not pleaded, would infringe the respondents’ and interested parties’ the right to a fair hearing.






50.
In the circumstances, the conclusion I come to is that the provision challenged not being in existence the petition is not well founded.






51.
However, for completeness of the matter and in case I be wrong on my conclusion above, is regulation 203(2)(d) unconstitutional? Regulation 203 is on request for review under section 167 of the Act which has to be in the form in the Fourth Schedule to the rules. The request has to state the reasons for the complaint; be accompanied by necessary statements; be made within 14 days of the occurrence of the breach complained of, if made before the making of an award; notification under section 87 or the occurrence of the breach complained of where the request is made after making of an award.






52.
The impugned regulation 203(2) provides that the request for review, (d) be accompanied by the fees set out in the Fifteenth Schedule of these Regulations, which shall not be refundable. Paragraph (d) does not contain the fee complained of. Rather, fees are in the Fifteenth Schedule to the Regulations. The Schedule gives the percentage of fees to be paid pegged on the tender amount, subject to a minimum amount of fees stated in the Schedule.






53.
As can be seen, regulation 203(2) (d) does not provide for the fees to be paid when applying for a review before the Board. The fee structure is in the Sixteenth Schedule a different part of the regulations whose constitutionality has not been assailed. A party who alleges that a statutory provision is constitutionally inform, must go beyond the mere allegation and demonstrate the constitutional invalidity. In the circumstances of this petition, I do not see merit in the alleged constitutional infirmity in regulation 203(2)(d) since the constitutionality of the schedule of fees has not been assailed and no order has been sought to nullify it.








Conclusion


54.
Having considered the petition, responses and arguments by parties and upon examination of the impugned regulation(s), the conclusion I come to, is that the petitioner has failed to prove that regulation 202(2)(d) exists. He has also not shown how regulation 203(2)(d) would be unconstitutional without challenging the Schedule of fees.






55.
Consequently, I find no merit in the petition and is dismissed.






56.
This being a public interest litigation, I make no orders on costs.

Ruling










1.
The Accused, Isaack Wamburi was charged with the offence of stealing contrary to Section 278 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to serve 18 months imprisonment. The particulars of the charge are that on the 9
th
 day of March 2024 at Tandare area in Kirima Sub-County within Laikipia County stole three sheeps white in colour valued at Kshs. 45,000/= the property of Joseph Njuguna Chege.






2.
Vide a letter dated 26
th
 September 2024, the trial Magistrate, E.Ngugi, SPM has brought to the attention of this court an anomaly the gist of which is that the said matter came up for ruling on the 10
th
 July 2024. The record indicates that the ruling was delivered acquitting the accused. Inexplicably, the same record shows that the accused informed the court that he wished to change plea and plea was taken on 11
th
 July 2024, the accused convicted and sentenced.






3.
The fact of the delivery of a ruling acquitting the accused and the conviction of the same accused on a plea of guilt are not legally tenable in the same proceedings.






4.
The trial magistrate has attributed this anomaly to an honest mistake on his part which escaped the notice of the prosecution counsel as well.






5.
The jurisdiction of this court to make orders on revision is under Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides:-
“
The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceedings before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of any such subordinate court.”






6.
The court is supposed to satisfy itself on the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order.






7.
I have perused the record. There is an obvious glaring error apparent on the face of the record. There is discernable incorrectness, illegality and impropriety in the proceedings and hence in the outcome of the proceedings.






8.
Once a ruling on a no case to answer was made, it was not open for the court to entertain a change of plea from the accused. To that extent, the conviction and sentence are vitiated by the irregularity therein a state of affairs that is not sustainable in law. The same is amenable to revision by this court and appropriate orders given pursuant to Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code.






9.
Incidents like this must be frowned upon and magistrates must be warned on the need for careful and meticulous handling of court proceedings to avoid visiting injustice on parties before court as has surely happened in this case.






10.
From the foregoing, the conviction and sentence in this matter are irregular. I invoke the powers of revision under Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code, set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court and substitute thereof an order acquitting the accused. He is to be set at liberty forthwith unless otherwise lawfully held.

Ruling










1.
I have considered the Notice of Motion Application dated 26
th
 January, 2024, together with affidavit in support sworn on even date; the supplementary affidavit sworn on 16
th
 September, 2024; and the replying affidavit sworn on 9
th
 February, 2024.






2.
The Applicant submitted that parties entered into a binding contract for the redemption of the Applicant’s property. He contended that some of the basic terms of the said agreement included terms to the effect that the property in question would be redeemed for the sum of Kshs. 22,000,000/= payable by way of a term loan, together with a lump sum payment of Kshs. 5,000,000/= approximately.






3.
Counsel clarified that although the said agreement was never executed, the said terms were still binding on the Bank because the terms had been agreed to by way of various correspondence.






4.
He submitted that the Bank had initially accepted his client’s terms, and that a professional undertaking had been issued by his law firm in respect of the same. He explained, that the reason the agreement was never executed was because after the draft was circulated, various amendments and suggestions were proposed by each the parties, which were not acceptable, either to his client or to the Bank. Accordingly, no final agreement was ever executed, and the Bank moved to issue its statutory notices.






5.
Counsel’s contention was that despite no formal execution of an agreement between the parties as stated above, the various terms agreed to between the parties arising out of the previous correspondence remain binding, and the Bank may not carry out the proposed sale.






6.
Counsel further argued that the sale value is below the market value set out in the Defendant’s own valuation report, and the same is therefore illegal.






7.
Based on the record before me, vide a letter of offer dated 21
st
 November, 2012, the Applicant took out an overdraft facility with the Respondent in the sum of Kshs. 40,000,000/= and a term loan facility of Kshs. 31,500,000/=. The letter is attached at FNI of the Respondent’s replying affidavit.






8.
It is also evident that the said facility was secured by way of a charge dated 2
nd
 December, 2014, and registered, and in favour of the Bank over the property, which is the subject matter of the application. Evidence of the same is found at FN 8 and FN 9 of the Respondent’s replying affidavit.






9.
Looking at the record, it appears that the Applicant stopped performing the contract sometime around the year 2020. At that time, the outstanding amount due to the Bank was approximately Kshs. 37,076,296/=.






10.
Looking at the various exhibits and based on the submissions of counsel, it is evident that the parties attempted to reach a settlement but could not do so. The terms proposed at the time included an initial payment of approximately Kshs. 5,000,000/= as stated above, and thereafter, the payment of the balance of Kshs. 17,000,000/=, over a period of three years, as a term loan, and by way of quarterly payments. However, as stated above, this agreement never bore fruit, and was never executed for various reasons.






11.
The evidence suggests that one of the reasons was because instead of making the said lump sum payment to the Bank, the Applicant opted to deposit the sum of Kshs. 5,198,400/= with its advocates instead, who in turn, issued a professional undertaking to pay over the said amount based on certain conditions, and upon execution of the agreement, which was still the subject of negotiation between the parties. As stated, the parties were however, unable to reach a mutual agreement, and no contract was ever executed. Accordingly, the said amount was never paid to the Bank.






12.
To my mind, and based on the above, the debt remains owing to the Bank. Upon inquiry, Counsel for the Applicant admitted that he did not know what amount was due to the Bank from the borrower on a monthly basis. He explained that his client is the chargor and not the borrower, and therefore, he had no knowledge of the same.






13.
Based on the record before me, it is evident that at some point over the years, the monthly repayment was approximately, Kshs. 375,000/= per month. Further, the record shows that the last full payment made by the borrower to the Bank was over three years ago, around May, 2021. Since then, the contract has not been performed by the borrower.






14.
Considering the arguments above, I do not think that depositing money with one’s advocates, or the issuance of a professional undertaking to pay the same conditioned upon a restructuring on satisfactory terms to the borrower, is the same as performing a contract. This is especially the case in circumstances where, to date, those sums have never been compiled with and the money has never been paid. The debt accordingly remains due to the Bank, and is long overdue.






15.
As regards the relevant legal notices, I note from the replying affidavit and exhibits attached that the 90 days’ Statutory Notice was served on 14
th
 September, 2022. The same was issued by registered post, and a certificate of post is available on the record. Evidence of the same is found at Exhibit FN 19 and FN 20 of the replying affidavit.






16.
Further, I note that the 40 - day Notice to Sell was issued to the Applicant and its Directors on 3
rd
 February, 2024, by way of registered post to the address outlined in the charge. Evidence of the same is found at Exhibit FN 21 and FN 22 of the replying affidavit.






17.
Finally, the 45 days’ Notice to Redeem under the Auctioneers rules was served on 20
th
 September, 2023, by way of registered post. Evidence of the same is found at FN 21, FN 24, and FN 25 of the replying affidavit.






18.
I am satisfied in light of the above that the relevant notices were duly served on the Applicant, and that the Bank’s statutory powers of sale crystalized in accordance with the law. It is also evident to me that the letter from the Bank to the Applicant dated 30
th
 November, 2023, was on a “without prejudice” basis. The said wording appears at the top of the letter, and the legal ramifications are self-explanatory. The said letter also states that the terms contained therein were contingent on payment being made to the Bank within 14 days of receipt of the letter. No such payment was made within the 14-day time frame. The said letter is found at Exhibit FN 29 of the replying affidavit.






19.
Based on the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that the binding contract referred to and relied on by the Applicant existed between the parties. No contract was ever executed; and no payment was ever made. Only a professional undertaking was issued, and again, to date, the sum owing has never been paid because the parties could not agree on mutually acceptable terms of repayment.






20.
In the circumstances described above, I am of the view that the Bank is entitled to exercise the statutory powers available to it under the law. Finally, as regards the Applicant’s submission relating to an allegation of undervaluation of the property, I am of the view that such a claim may still be pursued as a claim for, and remedy in damages. I do not think that the claim is in and of itself, a sufficient ground for the grant of an injunction.






21.
In the circumstances as described above, I find that the Applicant has not met the threshold for a grant of injunction as set out in Giella v Cassman Brown [1973] EA 358, namely:-
a.
Establish his case only at a prima facie level,
b.
Demonstrate irreparable injury that cannot be compensated by way of damages if a temporary injunction is not granted, and
c.
Ally any doubts as to (b) by showing that the balance of convenience is in his favour.






22.
In particular, I am satisfied that the Applicant has failed to make out a prima facie case under the first limb, in accordance with Mrao Ltd v First American Bank of Kenya Limited and 2 Others [2003] eKLR, namely, “a case in which on the material presented to the Court, a tribunal properly directing itself will conclude that there exists a right which has apparently been infringed by the opposite party to call for an explanation or rebuttal from the latter.”






23.
It is established that all the above three conditions and stages are to be applied as separate, distinct and logical hurdles which the Applicant is expected to surmount sequentially. Having failed to pass the first hurdle, the Applicant may not leap frog to the next and that brings the matter to an end.






24.
Based on the reasons as set out above, I find that the application is without merit. The same is accordingly dismissed with costs.

Claimant




and




Megh Singh Cushion Makers Limited


 


Respondent










Judgment










1.
The Claimant a registered trade union filed its Memorandum of Claim dated 3
rd
 August,2022 and pleaded inter alia as follows: -
a.
The Claimant averred that parties herein had a valid recognition agreement and a CBA which regulated terms and conditions of service for all unionisable employees of the Respondent before the Respondent changed its name from Megh Singh Cushion Makers to Megh Sign Cushion Maker’s Ltd. That the parties now have no recognition agreement.
b.
The Claimant averred that employees of the Respondent joined their union by appending their signature on check off forms acknowledging their membership. That the Respondent had a total workforce of 28 employees and the union had recruited 19 employees which translated to 67.85% which was above 50+ 1 % required under section 54(1) of the 
Labour Relations Act
.
c.
The Claimant averred that the union wrote a letter to the management with attached model recognition agreement, suggesting meeting with the management on 7
th
 August,2020 at 11 am in the management offices to sign the said document. That when the union went in the company on the said date the management was not available.
d.
The Claimant averred that on 10
th
 August,2020 it suggested another meeting to be held on 19
th
 August,2020 at 11 am as well as another one vide a letter of 2
nd
 September,2020 for a meeting on 16
th
 September,2020 to sign the recognition agreement but the management was yet again not available without giving any reasons.
e.
The Claimant averred that it was left to report the dispute to the Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Labour & Social Protection since the management was not cooperative. That the Cabinet Secretary appointed a conciliator in the dispute in accordance with section 65(1) of the 
Labour Relations Act
 to bring amicable settlement.
f.
The Claimant averred that the conciliator convened a conciliations meeting in his office for the parties to state their case. That the Conciliator gave his report, findings and recommendation where the Claimant agreed with the said findings and recommendations of the conciliator. That the union had followed the right procedure up to the ladder and this matter is well constituted and this court has the jurisdiction to hear and determine. That the employees of the Respondent exercised their democratic right by joining union of their choice in accordance with the section 4 of the 
Labour Relations Act
, Article 41 of 
the Constitution
 and the ILO Conventions Number 87 and 98.
g.
The Claimant prayed that this court be pleased to direct and order the Respondent to accord recognition agreement to the Claimant to pave way for the parties to engage in CBA negotiations to improve terms and conditions to all unionisable employees.






2.
The Respondent did not participate in these proceedings despite service and the court directed the parties to dispense the claim by written submissions.






Claimants’ Submissions


3.
The Claimant filed its written submissions dated 11
th
 March, 2024 and submitted that in accordance with Rule 3 of their Constitution it was the right union to represent the employees of the Respondent. That it made efforts to meet the Respondent to sign recognition agreement in vain and there was no other union seeking recognition with the Respondent.






4.
The Claimant reiterated their claim and submitted that since they filed this matter and served the Respondent it has never participated in the proceedings. That section 48(2) of the 
Labour Relations Act
 provides for the Minister to direct an employer with more than five employees to deduct union dues and remit them in a specified account. That the Union on 27
th
 July,2020 did send check off forms signed by the Respondent employees who had acknowledged their membership with the Claimant requesting the Respondent to deduct and remit 2.5% of employees basic salary subject to minimum of Kshs 200.






5.
The Claimant submitted that the Respondent will not suffer any irreparable harm if it signs the recognition agreement with the Claimant and the findings and recommendations of the Conciliator should be upheld. That the court should direct the Respondent to deduct and remit union dues to the Claimant as per above section 48(2).








Determination


6.
The Claimant seeks this court to order the Respondent to enter in to recognition agreement with it so that it may start the CBA negotiations to better the terms of the Respondent’s employees and the Respondent to deduct and remit union dues as per its check off forms. It is worth noting that before the Respondent changed its name to a limited company it had a recognition agreement with the Claimant who had stated that there was no other union seeking recognition.






7.
It is a democratic right of an employee to join any trade union of their choice as per section 4(1)(b) of the 
Labour Relations Act
 and article 41 of 
the Constitution
 among other international provisions. Section 54 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 provides for recognition of trade unions and CBA. It provides as follows:_
54(1) An employer, including an employer in the public sector, shall recognise a trade union for purposes of collective bargaining if that trade union represents the simple majority of unionisable employees.






8.
The Claimant alleged that the Respondent had 28 employees and it recruited 19 employees which formed 67.85% which is above the simple majority of 50+1%. This therefore means that the Claimant had attained the simple majority of the Respondent’s work force.






9.
The court notes that the Claimant tried to have meeting with the Respondent in order to sign the recognition agreement in vain and the matter was referred to the Cabinet Secretary who appointed the conciliator as per section 65 of the Act. The conciliator gave their recommendations which included the Respondent initiating the process of recognizing the Claimant and remit any deducted dues. The respondent failed and or ignored to do so hence the claimant approached the Court.






10.
The court has the necessary jurisdiction to hear and determine this claim after the internal dispute resolution failed.






11.
Whereas The Claimant having met the simple majority required by the Act which is 50+1 % the Respondent was bound to recognize it. The court in the case of Kudheiha Workers v United States International University-Africa (USIU) [2021] eKLR held that:-
“
It is therefore clear that for a union to qualify for recognition it must prove that it has recruited a simple majority of the employees of the Respondent.






12.
The court notes that the Conciliator pointed out that the Respondent did not bring documents as requested to counter the Claimant’s assertions and in this case the Respondent did not participate in these proceedings to rebut the Claimant’s assertions on achieving the simple majority. The court takes the Claimant’s assertions as true.






13.
On the issue of union dues section 48 and 49 of the 
Labour Relations Act
 provides for the same The Minister is required to gazette such deductions. The court from the pleadings notes that the same were gazetted by the Minister in 2012 and the parties had a recognition agreement before the Respondent changed to a limited liability company. The Claimant sent check off forms on 27
th
 July,2020 to the Respondent who was supposed to deduct and remit unions dues of the employees who were members of the Claimant but that did not happen. The court notes that once the union sends the check off forms to the Respondent, the Respondent had a duty to start the deductions and remittance of the dues.






14.
In the case of Kenya National Union of Nurses v County Public Service Board Homabay [2018] eKLR  the court observed as follows:-
More fundamentally, the recognition agreement does not affect the deduction and remittance of union dues. The purpose or consequence of signing a recognition agreement is to give the union a right to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. Deduction and remittance of union dues is not based on recognition agreement but on Form S which as I have stated above, is the authority for deduction of union dues from the salary or wages of an employee. The amount deductible is set by the Gazette Notice from the Minister for Labour which also gazettes the Bank and account into which the deductions should be sent.






15.
The court therefore orders the Respondent to recognize the Claimant’s union so long as its members are as they were at filing of this suit or have not dropped below the simple majority.






16.
The Respondent is further ordered to forthwith remit deducted union dues to the claimant’s designated account as per the checkoff forms.






17.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The Objectors/Applicants herein filed an application dated 25
th
 November 2023, pursuant to Rule 47 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 seeking the following reliefs: -
a.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to cancel the Title Deeds issued to:
i.
Benard Masake on 4
th
 March 2019 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494
ii.
Washingtone Osairi Masake on 15
th
 December 2015 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/200.
iii.
Fredrick Chepkurui on 21
st
 May 2009 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/1781.
b.
That upon grant of prayer (a) hereinabove, the Title Deed do revert to Henry Medosi Masake(deceased).
c.
That the costs of the Application be provided for.






2.
The application is supported by the grounds set out on the face thereof and by the supporting affidavit of Emmanuel Masake, the Objector, sworn on even date on his behalf and on behalf of the 2
nd
 Petitioner. The Objectors gravamen is inter alia; that the deceased herein Henry Medosi Masake was the registered owner of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494,200 & 1781 prior to his demise; that the deceased died on 1
st
 April 2010; that Bernard, Washingtone and Fredrick illegally and unlawfully caused parcel numbers N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494,200 & 1781 to be transferred to their names respectively without valid succession proceedings; that he and his co-Petitioner were finally issued with a grant of letters of administration intestate and that they now wish to proceed with confirmation thereof; that the transfer of the said property to their names was not only illegal but fraudulent; that the act of transferring the said land without valid succession proceedings amounts to intermeddling with the property of the estate of the deceased; that it is in the interest of justice that the registration of Benard Masake on 4
th
 March 2019 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494,Washingtone Osairi Masake on 15
th
 December 2015 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/200 and Fredrick Chepkurui on 21
st
 May 2009 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/1781 be cancelled so that the same reverts to the name of the deceased Henry Medosi Masake.






3.
The Petitioners strongly opposed the application vide a replying affidavit sworn on 15
th
 April 2024 by Benard Masake. It is imperative to note that the said fees for filing this pleading has not yet been paid for which simply means the Objectors’ application is unopposed as the said replying affidavit is not properly on record.






4.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. Only the Objectors duly complied.






5.
Having looked at the application, and the Objectors submissions, the only issue for determination is whether the Objectors application has merit.






6.
Pursuant to Section 82 (b) (11) of the 
Law of Succession Act
, it is provided that no immovable property of a deceased person shall be sold before confirmation of grant. Hence, any sale and transfer of land belonging to the estate of the deceased amounts to intermeddling with such an estate and is a punishable offence under Section 45 of the said Act. It is instructive that the grant herein is yet to be confirmed and as such, any dealing with the property of the deceased before confirmation is frowned upon by the 
Law of Succession Act
. From the averments of the Objectors, registration of Benard Masake on 4
th
 March 2019 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494, Washingtone Osairi Masake on 15
th
 December 2015 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/200 and Fredrick Chepkurui on 21
st
 May 2009 in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/1781 clearly indicate that the same were done prior to the confirmation of grant issued on 5
th
 August 2022. I find the actions of 2
nd
 Petitioner, 1
st
 Petitioner and Fredrick Chepkurui to amount to intermeddling with the estate of the deceased herein. In the case of Munyasia Mulili & 3 others -Vs Sammy Muteti Mulili (2017) eKLR the court held as follows:-
“
…. No immovable property shall be sold before confirmation of grant. Any such distribution of the deceased’s properties before confirmation of grant whether by way of registration of title or sale is thus liable to revocation pursuant to the powers granted to this court by section 47 of the Laws of Succession Act and rule 73 of the Probate and Administration Rules”.






7.
From the foregoing, it is clear that all the assets of the deceased should be dealt with only upon confirmation of grant. This Court has the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the matter and make orders as appropriate as regards the estate of the deceased.






8.
As the estate of the deceased is yet to be distributed and since the 2
nd
 Petitioner, 1
st
 Petitioner and Fredrick Chepkurui proceeded to transmit the ownership of the title to their respective names and even sell to purchasers without the grant being confirmed, it is my considered view that the proper course of action is to have the titles in possession of the 2
nd
 Petitioner, 1
st
 Petitioner and Fredrick Chepkurui cancelled and to revert in the name of the deceased for distribution together with other assets.






9.
In view of the foregoing observations, i find merit in the Objectors application dated 25
th
 November 2023. The same is allowed in the following terms: -
i.
The title of Benard Masake in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/3494 be and is hereby cancelled and that the same do revert in the name of the deceased Henry Medosi Masake.
ii.
The title of Washingtone Osairi Masake in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/200 be and is hereby cancelled and that the same do revert in the name of the deceased Henry Medosi Masake.
iii.
The title of Fredrick Chepkurui in respect of land parcel No. N. Malakisi/ W. Sasuri/1781 be and is hereby cancelled and that the same do revert in the name of the deceased Henry Medosi Masake.
iv.
The County Land Registrar Bungoma is hereby ordered to execute the orders herein forthwith.
v.
The summons for confirmation of grant dated 14
th
 November 2022 and the affidavit of Protest dated 6
th
 April 2023 and 10
th
 July 2023 are hereby fixed for directions on 22
nd
 October, 2024.
vi.
Each party to bear their own costs.
Orders accordingly.

Judgment










1.
The deceased herein Wafula Wepolombia Lumbasi died intestate on the 26
th
 May 2006 in Bungoma and that he was survived by one wife, 10 sons and 3 daughters. His wife and several of his children are now deceased. The deceased’s estate comprised of Land Parcel No. Bungoma/Kiminini/186 as the only asset.






2.
The Petitioner herein instituted succession proceedings on the estate of the deceased and that on 6
th
 March 2008, he was issued with a grant of letters of administration. He proceeded to file an application for confirmation of grant dated 24
th
 April 2011.






3.
Vide Summons for Revocation or Annulment of Grant dated 4
th
 October 2011, and filed in Court on 4
th
 October 2011, the Objectors herein are seeking the revocation/nullification of Grant of Letters of Administration Intestate issued to the Petitioner on 6
th
 March 2008 on the grounds that the said Grant was obtained by concealment of material facts as the Petitioner did not notify the Objectors of the grant making process and that the said grant was obtained fraudulently by making of false statements before the Court.






4.
All the applications were eventually abandoned with the parties focusing on the confirmation of grant application dated 24
th
 April 2011. Each party filed their respective schedules of mode of distribution for consideration.






5.
On 20
th
 May 2022, this Court directed the County Surveyor Bungoma to visit Land Parcel No. Bungoma/Kiminini/186 for purposes inter alia: to establish the total acreage on ground; to establish the exact share of each beneficiary on ground and file his respective report in Court.






6.
Vide Court directions issued on 18
th
 July 2023, the parties opted to proceed with the dispensation of the application for summons for confirmation of grant and protest via viva voce evidence. The matter kicked off for hearing on 13.12.2023.






7.
On 13
th
 December 2023, OB-PW1, Richard Khamala Wafula testified that the deceased herein was his father. The Court adopted the contents of his sworn affidavit dated 18
th
 July 2023 and the annexures as his evidence-in chief. He told the Court that he objected to the Petitioner being the Administrator of his late father’s estate and that he has never sold any land to anyone. He told the Court that the Petitioner sold land to the Interested Party. He testified that during the surveyors visit, both the beneficiaries of the deceased and the creditors to the estate of the deceased were present but that the list has not been availed before this Court and those who were present did not sign against their names. He testified that he made his mode of distribution but there was no consent duly executed availed before the Court.
On cross-examination by the Interested Party, he told the Court that he does not know the interested party but that he has developed the portion he purchased from the Petitioner and that he has no problem with the Interested Party’s use of portion of land save only for access to his land. He told the Court that the Interested Party is in occupation of the portion he purchased and that he gained access to it after the demise of his mother.
On cross-examination by the Petitioner, he told the Court that he is not aware of when exactly the Petitioner Petitioned the Court with regard to the estate of the deceased herein. He maintained that his mode of distribution is the correct one and that their late father had 10 sons and 3 daughters. He further told the Court that 4 out of the 10 sons plus all the daughters are now deceased.
On re-examination, he told the Court that the Interested Party occupied his portion after the demise of his father and that his dispute with the Interested Party is simply on road of access. He told the Court that the Petitioner and other beneficiaries sold their portions to the Interested Party. He told the Court that he did not sign the list of those who were present at the meeting and that the land in question is still in the name of the deceased. He told the Court that the Petitioner did not avail his mode of distribution.
The Objectors closed their case.






8.
INT-PW1, Linus Chesoli Wekesa, testified that he is the Interested Party herein. The Court adopted his affidavit sworn on 20
th
 May 2023 and the annexures thereto as his evidence in chief. He told the Court that he does not know the Objectors. He told the Court that the land in question was purchased by his father from the Petitioner and his brother, Patrick. He added that the Petitioner sold two acres while Patrick sold one acre, and that his late father proceeded to build on the said land.
On cross-examination by the Objectors’ counsel, he told the Court that he learnt that the land belongs to the deceased herein and that the deceased died much earlier. He told the Court that his late father purchased the portions from the sons of the deceased in 2009. He told the Court that he could not attest to whether the Petitioner had the capacity to sell off the land and that the name of Patrick is not indicated in the said sale agreement but that he sold one acre.
On cross-examination by the Petitioner, he told the Court that his father purchased the said portion from him and Patrick and that at that moment the Petitioner was acting as the Administrator of the estate of the deceased.
On re-examination, he told the Court that Patrick sold to his father one acre and that the signature attests to the same. He told the Court that he is currently using the land and that both the Petitioner and Patrick have not interfered with his occupation and possession, even their siblings.
That marked the close of the interested party’s case.






9.
PET-PW1, Dismas Sifuna Wafula, testified that he is the Petitioner herein and that he duly filed his mode of distribution. The Court adopted the same as his evidence in chief. He refuted the proposed mode of distribution by the Objectors and urged this Court to adopt his proposed mode of distribution. According to him, the mode of distribution by the Objectors reflects strangers to the estate of the deceased and that the Interested Party is the only true purchaser and has no objection to him occupying his portion as sold to him. He attested to the fact that there are other purchasers who purchased land from his brothers and that he has no problem with them getting their respective portions.
On cross-examination by Objectors’ counsel, he told the Court that the asset is still in the name of the deceased and that the deceased had sold his land to six different purchasers, and that his late father died before sub-dividing his land. He told the Court that the Interested Party did not buy the land from the deceased and that he proposed to have two acres which he sold off to the Interested Party. He confirmed that he was present when the surveyor visited the land but that he is yet to see or peruse the surveyors report. He confirmed that he was the seller in the sale agreement on behalf of the deceased and that he never indicated anywhere that he was an administrator in the sale agreement. He confirmed that he sold the land as an administrator to the estate of the deceased and that he had the grant in 2009, and that the same did not authorize him to sell any land. He told the Court that he never wasted the estate of the deceased as alleged as the property is still in the name of the deceased. He told the Court that he made provisions for his late sisters and that he did not file a consent to his proposed mode of distribution. He confirms that he has no share to the land of the deceased as he sold the same to the Interested Party’s father.
On cross-examination by the Interested Party, he told the Court that the Objectors failed to list all the family members in their proposed mode of distribution and that he only sold land on behalf of his brothers who wanted to sell. He confirmed that Patrick sold off one acre of his portion and that the 1
st
 Objector has no share in the deceased’s estate as he was settled in Trans Nzoia. He insisted that his mode of distribution is fair compared to the one raised by the Objectors. He insisted that none of his family members object to the occupation of the Interested Party’s portion except the 1
st
 Objector. He told the Court that he has no objection to the Interested Party getting his portion and that his mode of distribution does cater for his deceased siblings.






10.
PET-PW2, Jairus Juma Wafula, testified that he was the son of the deceased herein. The Court adopted the contents of his affidavit as sworn and filed on 20
th
 May 2023 as his evidence in chief. He told the Court that he was allocated five acres by the deceased but has not availed any evidence in that regard.
On cross-examination by Objectors’ counsel, he told the Court that he was allocated five acres by the deceased but has not availed any evidence in that regard. He insisted that his father gifted him five acres and that he speaks only the truth. That he does not agree with the surveyor’s report wherein he has been allocated only 0.9 Ha
On cross-examination by the Interested Party’s counsel, he told the Court that they are 13 children in total and that his father allocated each child land. He confirmed that the father to the Interested Party did purchase land from the Petitioner herein and that his brother Patrick was given one acre. He told the Court that the 1
st
 Objector resides on his two acres and that he never left the farm and that he has no objection in the Interested Party getting his portion as purchased.
On re-examination, he told the Court that the 1
st
 Objector was given land elsewhere and he later decided to occupy land that is not his and that John Simiyu Wafula was given two acres. He told the Court that he does agree with the surveyor’s report which has fixed the problem.






11.
PET-PW3, John Simiyu Wafula, testified that he was the son of the deceased herein. The Court adopted the contents of his statement as recorded on 14
th
 January, 2024 as his evidence in chief. He told the Court that he knows the Interested Party herein and that the deceased sold his land but he has no sale agreement to attest to the same. He confirmed that he was present during the surveyor’s visit.
On cross-examination by the Objectors’ counsel, he told the Court that he has one acre as per the report and that the said report is a true reflection of what is on the ground. He told the Court that he does not object to the surveyor’s report. He told the Court that the 1
st
 Objector resides on the deceased’s land but that the other Objectors were settled elsewhere. He wants the 1
st
 Objector to move out of the portion he is currently settled on and that he has a stake on that land. He told the Court that only three of them are aggrieved and that the 1
st
 Objector should move because he was catered for elsewhere but has no documentation to prove the same.
On cross-examination by the Interested Party’s counsel, he told the Court that the Petitioner is his younger brother and that he has no problem with him being an administrator. He told the Court that he is aware that his family owes the Interested Party about three acres from their land and that he is not aware which parcel the administrator should get. He also told the Court that Patrick, his brother sold off one acre of his land. According to him, the deceased gave the Petitioner two acres and who sold them and went to buy five acres elsewhere. He told the Court that the Petitioner is entitled to get two acres and another one acre from the 1
st
 Objector and that the same are to be given to the Interested Party.
On re-examination, he told the Court that the deceased lefty behind 13 children but only seven are alive. He insisted that the 1
st
 Objector was settled with five acres.






12.
At the close of the Petitioner’s case, parties were directed to file and serve their respective written submission. Only the Petitioner and Objectors complied with the Court directives.






13.
I have duly considered the parties submissions, Affidavits of mode of distributions as fronted, grounds in support of the application and the grounds in opposition thereto. I have also considered the rival evidence of the Petitioner, Objectors and Interested party.






14.
Before i get into the substance of the matter before me, it is critical that i deal with the issue of the Interested Party’s late father who purchased the portions of the asset of the estate of the deceased from a son of the deceased. Section 79 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 should be read together with Sections 82 and 83 of the Act, which set out the powers and duties of administrators. Once the assets of the deceased were vested in the administrators, the administrators would then be entitled to exercise the powers conferred upon administrators by Section 82, and that they were subject to the duties that were imposed by Section 83. The powers included powers to enter into contracts with respect to assets of the estate, to sue and be sued with regard to estate assets, among others. Entering into contracts over estate assets would include converting estate assets by way of sale. However, Section 82(b)(ii) of the Act outlawed the sale of immovable assets of an estate before the grant had been confirmed. That would mean that any such sale would be unlawful and unenforceable unless it happened with the leave of the Court.






15.
This simply means that the Interested Party’s late father who purchased portions of the deceased’s estate post the deceased persons death, 26
th
 May 2006, are not creditors of the estate. He would only have a claim against the estate if he had transacted over the land with the deceased owner himself. The transaction in question appeared to have been entered into after the deceased died because as per the availed sale agreement which indicated the date they entered into the transaction as 7
th
 August, 2009. The document placed before the Court was the sale agreement signed by the Interested Party’s father and the deceased’s son who is the Petitioner herein, since it was generated after the deceased had died.






16.
The alleged sale of land did not happen during the deceased’s lifetime and did not involve the deceased, but after his death, involving one of his surviving sons before he had obtained representation to enable him administer the estate. That would mean, by dint of Section 79 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, that the assets of the estate had not yet vested in the deceased’s son. He, therefore, did not have power by dint of Section 82 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, to sell the property. He could not enter into any binding contract with anybody over any of the assets that made up the estate of the deceased.






17.
By dint of Section 45 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, any transaction between the Petitioner and the Interested Party’s father amounted to intermeddling with the estate of the deceased, and those involved, therefore, would be deemed to have engaged in criminal activity and should have been prosecuted. The sales contravened Sections 45 and 82 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 and that there was no possibility that the Interested Party’s father could have acquired any valid title from the sales as the person who purported to sell the property to them had no title to it. He had nothing to sell and that the Interested Party’s father bought nothing from him.






18.
From the Court record, it is clear that the Land Parcel Bungoma/Kiminini/186 measuring 13.7 HA is still registered under the name of the deceased herein. The surveyor’s report dated 26
th
 February 2023, indicated the true ground acreage of the parcel as 12.93HA and the occupation on the ground.






19.
From the Court records, it is clear that the deceased person was survived by:
a.
Lena Bunyasi Mukelule
b.
Joyce Monica Nyamu
c.
Joseph Waswa Wafula
d.
Daniel Wekhanya Wafula

j.

m.
Margret Khakasa Kachila.






20.
Upon perusal of the filed form P & A 5 in Court on 5
th
 November 2007, it is clear that the only creditors of the estate of the deceased were: Edward Simiyu and Maurice Wambomba who purchased three and one acres respectively.






21.
As earlier captured, this Court noted that the sale of the deceased’s portion of land to the Interested Party’s father by the Petitioner herein is invalid. When he entered into the sale agreement on 7
th
 August 2009, he had not yet been appointed administrator of the estate of the deceased. The property in question, therefore, had not yet vested in him as administrator by virtue of Section 79 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, and therefore he could not exercise the powers of sale over that property given by Section 82 of the 
Law of Succession Act
. He had no title to the property and had no power to sell it.






22.
The only remedy available to the buyers, with regard to the transactions, was to pursue the person who purported to sell the property to them, which in this case, as per the evidence of the Petitioner he is very willing to settle him from his respective portion. The Interested Party was not a survivor of the deceased and thus his claim is neither a liability nor creditor of the estate.






23.
From the evidence on record, it is alleged that the deceased had gifted some of his sons land prior to his death but no evidence in form of minutes or witnesses was availed in Court to substantiate the same. This simply means that this Court is at liberty to distribute the whole 12.93 HA as none of the parties have been able to reach a consensus on the mode of distribution.






24.
Upon perusal of the Petitioner’s and Objectors’ proposed mode of distribution, it is clear that the Petitioner caters to individuals who are strangers to the estate as they purchased land from him when the property in question, therefore, had not yet vested in him as administrator by virtue of Section 79 of the 
Law of Succession Act
, and therefore he could not exercise the powers of sale over that property given by Section 82 of the 
Law of Succession Act
. He had no title to the property and had no power to sell it. This simply means that they are not creditors or liabilities to the estate of the deceased.






25.
In view of the forgoing observations, the following orders are hereby made:
i.
The mode of distribution proposed by Petitioner on parcel number Bungoma/Kiminini/186 lacks merit as the same includes strangers on to the distribution schedule. The same is dismissed.
ii.
The mode of distribution proposed by the Objectors on parcel number Bungoma/Kiminini/186 lacks merit as the same has been distributed with the wrong actual acreage as per the surveyor’s report and includes the Interested Party herein who is a stranger to the estate of the deceased.

IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF THE LATE JUSTICE DANIEL KENNEDY SULTANI AGANYANYA (DECEASED)








Ruling










1.
In her Chamber Summons application dated 5
th
 September 2023 and filed on 27
th
 September 2023, the 1
st
 Petitioner herein sought for orders that Schedule C of the Rectified Grant be affirmed and that the rectified Grant be rectified further to delete item XX(ii) being the widow’s pension benefit erroneously described as widow’s pension/gratuity as an item falling for inheritance and distribution amongst the natural children of the deceased either in equal shares or as deemed fit in the succession proceedings as previously erroneously directed in the rectified grant.






2.
She further prayed that Schedule C in the said Rectified Certificate of Confirmation barring the deceased’s beneficiaries from inheriting her estate upon her demise be confirmed.






3.
On 25
th
 March 2024, the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Petitioner swore a Replying Affidavit in opposition to the 1
st
 Petitioner’s application herein. The same was filed on 28
th
 March 2024.






4.
The 1
st
 Petitioner’s Written Submissions dated 12
th
 February 2024 and Supplementary Written Submissions dated 11
th
 April 2024 were both filed on 24
th
 May 2024 while the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Petitioner’s Written Submissions were dated 25
th
 March 2024 and filed on 28
th
 March 2024. The Ruling herein is therefore based on the said Written Submissions that all parties relied upon in their entirety.






Legal Analysis


5.
This court considered the respective parties’ Written submissions and noted that the same arguments had been advanced in respect of the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Petitioners’ Notice of Motion application that was dated and filed on 28
th
 July 2023 and this court delivered Ruling No (1). This court did not therefore find it useful to set out the arguments and counter-arguments in this Ruling so as to use scarce judicial time efficiently but noted that the same applied mutatis mutandis to the arguments that were advanced in Ruling No (1).






6.
In its said delivered Ruling No (1) relating to deletion of xxii in the Rectified Certificate of Grant being the widow’s pension benefit erroneously described as widow’s pension/gratuity stated to be shared equally amongst the natural children of the deceased be deleted as an item from the Rectified Certificate of Grant, this court found the same to have been merited.






7.
Just like this court had found in its Ruling No (1) herein in respect of the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Petitioners’ Notice of Motion application dated and filed on 28
th
 July 2023, this court found and held that the 1
st
 Petitioner herein had exclusive entitlement of the deceased’s pension as she was the lawful surviving wife of the deceased and the deceased’s children were above twenty-one (21) years of age. In addition, the deceased’s children, who included the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Petitioners herein could only access the pension in the event she died or remarried.






8.
Indeed, Section 17 of the 
Pensions Act
 Cap 189 (Laws of Kenya) provides that:-
1.
Subject to the other provisions of this Act—
a.
where an officer who has had ten or more years’ service dies after he has retired from the service of the Government having been granted a pension under this Act, there shall continue to be paid a dependants’ pension, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in subsection (2), to the widow or the children of the officer for a period of five years next following the date of the officer’s death, at the rate of the officer’s pension at the date of his death;
b.
where a pensionable officer who has served the Government for ten or more years dies while in the service, the President may grant to the widow or the children of the officer, in addition to any grant made under Section 18, a dependants’ pension, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in subsection (2), for a period of five years next following the date of the officer’s death at a rate not exceeding the amount of any pension that could have been granted to the officer if he had retired on medical grounds on the date of his death:
Provided that in the event of a widow to whom a dependants’ pension has been granted under the provisions of this subsection dying or otherwise ceasing to be entitled to the pension, the child or children who are entitled, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in subsection (2), to a dependants’ pension shall be entitled in accordance with those terms and conditions to receive the dependants’ pension for the remainder of the period of five years from the officer’s death which is still outstanding at the date on which the widow dies or otherwise ceases to be entitled to the dependants’ pension.






9.
Similarly, as this court had also found, it would be imprudent, unjust and/or unlawful to affirm Schedule C of the Grant to disinherit the deceased’s children from her estate in case of her demise because step children have a right to inherit from their step parent in their unfortunate demise. Schedule C of the Certificate of Confirmation had disinherited them contrary to the provisions of the law.






10.
Notably, Section 29 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 defines who a dependant is. It reads as follows:
“
For the purposes of this Part, ""dependant"" means:-
a.
the wife or wives, or former wife or wives, and the children of the deceased whether or not maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death;
b.
such of the deceased’s parents, step-parents, grand-parents, grandchildren, step-children, children whom the deceased had taken into his family as his own, brothers and sisters, and half-brothers and half-sisters, as were being maintained by the deceased immediately prior to his death; and
c.
where the deceased was a woman, her husband if he was being maintained by her immediately prior to the date of her death.”
d.
Rectification of grants is provided for in Section 74 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 and Rule 43(1) of the Probate and Administration Rules.
e.
Section 74 of the Law of Succession provides as follows:
“
Errors in names and descriptions, or in setting forth the time and place of the deceased’s death, or the purpose in a limited grant, may be rectified by the court, and the grant of representation, whether before or after confirmation, may be altered and amended accordingly.”
f.
Rule 43(1) of the Probate and Administration Rules provides that:-
“
Where the holder of a grant seeks pursuant to the provisions of section 74 of the Act rectification of an error in the grant as to the names or descriptions of any person or thing or as to the time or place of death of the deceased or, in the case of a limited grant, the purpose for which the grant was made, he shall apply by summons in Form 110 for such rectification through the registry and in the cause in which the grant was made.”
g.
From the language of Section 74 of the 
Law of Succession Act
 and Rule 43(1) of the Probate and Administration Rules, the scope of rectification of grants of representation was limited to errors in names and descriptions, or in setting forth the time and place of the deceased’s death as was held in the case of In the matter of the estate of Hasalon Mwangi Kahero [2013] eKLR or the purpose in a limited grant. Such other minor errors in that genre could also be rectified.
h.
As the entries the Petitioner wanted rectified did not fall under the provisions of Section 74 of the Law of Succession, to progress this matter, this court found and held that it could proceed to revoke the Grant of Letters of Administration Intestate under the provisions of 76 of the 
Law of Succession Act
.
i.
The said Section 76 of the Law of Succession states that:-
“
A grant of representation, whether or not confirmed, may at any time be revoked or annulled if the court decides, either on application by any interested party or of its own motion (emphasis court) that the grant has become useless and inoperative through subsequent circumstances.”






11.
This court could not discharge the Petitioners herein from being administrators of the deceased’s estate until they had complied with Section 83(g) of the Law of Succession Cap 160 (Laws of Kenya) that provides as follows:-
“
Personal representatives shall have the following duties—
within six months from the date of confirmation of the grant, or such longer period as the court may allow, to complete the administration of the estate in respect of all matters other than continuing trusts, and to produce to the court a full and accurate account of the completed administration.”








Disposition


12.
For the forgoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the 1
st
 Petitioner’s Chamber Summons application dated 5
th
 September 2023 and filed on 27
th
 September 2023 was partly merited as far as Prayer Nos (4) and (5) were concerned. The effect of this is that part the Prayer Nos (4) and (5) be and are hereby allowed while Prayer Nos (3) and (6) be and are hereby dismissed.






13.
The Rectified Certificate of Grant dated 27
th
 October 2022 be and is hereby revoked forthwith to delete and/or omit xxii Pension/ Gratuity from the assets to be distributed to the deceased’s children and Schedule C in its entirety.






14.
It is hereby directed that a fresh Certificate of Grant reflecting the changes be issued forthwith.






15.
As this was an emotive family cause, this court deemed it fit not to award costs to any party so as to preserve the family ties. Each party will therefore bear its own costs.






16.
Matter to be mentioned on 10
th
 March 2024 to confirm compliance with Section 83(g) of the Law of Succession Cap 160 (Laws of Kenya) and/or for further orders and/or directions.






17.
It is so ordered.

          (Being an appeal against the Ruling of CAS Mutai-SPM Bungoma dated and delivered on the 18th October 2022 in Bungoma Chief Magistrate’s Court Misc. Civil Application No. 579 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit at the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 231,608.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling in grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and Supporting Affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2) where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable






4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.






5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit at the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 18
th
 October 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KBK 413C and ZE 7101 to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 5,409,723.44/=. The enclosed letter of instruction was duly completed and executed. The 1
st
 Respondent was instructed to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000) 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham (1991) 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs. 277,008.66/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.231,608.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 231,608.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.




It so ordered.

          (Being an  appeal against  the Ruling of CAS  Mutai-SPM Bungoma dated and delivered on the 18th October 2022 in Bungoma Chief Magistrate’s Court Misc. Civil Application No. 580 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 182,703.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling in grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and Supporting Affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2) where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable






4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.






5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 28
th
 February 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KCE 183B to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 577,924.05/=. The enclosed letter of instruction was duly completed and executed. The 1
st
 Respondent was instructed to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -

“

This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28

The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deposed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 218,538.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering that items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling on grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dictates on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and supporting affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September, 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Applicant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principle; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this reference by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2).
where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable
4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.
5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first port of call. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Applicant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The Applicant’s contention is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Applicant herein vide a correspondence dated 28
th
 February 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KCF 645A to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 448,128.15/=. They duly completed and executed letter of instruction and instructed the 1st Respondent to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Applicant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -




No.

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000) 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham (1991) 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs 272,538.61/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.218,538.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs.218,538.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the Learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.




It so ordered.

Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September, 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 74,696.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling in grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a replying affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and supporting affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September, 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2) where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable






4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.






5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, supporting affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 14
th
 February 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KCC 594Y to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 416,843.15/=. They duly completed and executed letter of instruction and instructed the 1st Respondent to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the

The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.

It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 74, 696.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.




It so ordered.

Ruling










1.
Vide an application dated 18
th
 March 2024, the Applicants herein sought orders to have this Honourable Court reinstate this succession cause that had been dismissed for want of prosecution and that this Court issues preservatory orders staying the distribution, intermeddling and/or transmission of land parcel W. Bukusu/S.Mateka/5406 within Bungoma County. It also sought for an order striking out all that parcel of land known as W.Bukusu/S.Mateka Bungoma County Lr. No. 5406 from forming part of the estate of Joyce Oluoch Wekesa in Bungoma Magistrate’s court Succession Cause No. E074 of 2021.






2.
The application was premised on the grounds on the face of the application and the affidavit in support sworn by the 1
st
 Applicant herein on 18
th
 March 2024. The Applicants’ gravamen are inter alia; that the administrator Joyce Aluoch Wekesa who is their mother has since passed on without completing the exercise of transmission of the estate to the respective beneficiaries; that the estate remains un-administered since February, 2020 and risks going to waste; that any activities on the estate amounts to intermeddling which is punishable by law; that the confirmed grant issued to the deceased administrator has since become useless and inoperative; that the Respondents have filed a succession cause in the lower court being Cause No. E074 of 2021in the estate of the deceased administrator Joyce Aluoch Wekesa wherein they have listed one of the deceased’s asset among the administrator’s assets; that the said deceased administrator had transferred the land parcel in question to herself and was thereafter to transfer to the beneficiaries but unfortunately passed on and thus the said asset forms part of the deceased’s properties and not the deceased administrator.






3.
Responding to the application, the 1
st
 Objector swore a replying affidavit dated 26
th
 April 2024, wherein he contended that the administrator of the estate of the deceased herein carried out the succession to its logical conclusion and that the grant was confirmed on 16
th
 March 2007 and later amended on 9
th
 February 2009. He contends that the Administrator herein who was his late mother died when she had already completed administration and that the remaining aspect was to ensure that each party gets their respective shares. He also contends that the land parcel No. W.Bukusus/S. Mateka/5406 is not part of the estate of the deceased as per the certificate of confirmation of grant. It was further contended that there is no way the said parcel can be part of this cause yet it had not been registered in the name of the deceased herein. It was finally contended that the Applicants are not genuine yet they had financed the deceased administrator to be registered as owner of parcel S.MATEKA/KABULA/1368 which was in the name of one James Karori Namachanja and which was duly distributed to all the beneficiaries.






4.
In response to the replying affidavit, the Applicants vide the 1
st
 Applicant swore a supplementary affidavit dated 27
th
 May 2024, wherein she averred that the replying affidavit is inadequate and unattainable. According to her, the grant was rendered inoperative and incapable of being successfully administered once the Administrator died thus the need to reinstate the cause.






5.
She averred that the administrator of the estate refused to capture Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/1698 as part of the assets of the deceased and relied on the green card annexed and marked as DSW-1 dated 4
th
 April 2024. She insisted that the administrator, her late mother, fraudulently transferred Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/1698 to her name and that the same was never included as one of the assets of the deceased. She relied on the green card annexed and marked as DSW-2 dated 4
th
 April 2024. Furthermore, she averred that land parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5406 is subject of succession proceedings in Bungoma Magistrate’s Court Succession Cause No. E074 of 2022-In the Matter of the Estate of Joyce Aluoch Wekesa as the same was as a result of a sub-division of Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/1698 which was registered in the name of the deceased herein. She relied on the green card annexed as DSW-3 dated 4
th
 April 2024.






6.
She contends that the mother title was Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/1698 which was later sub-divided into two portions Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4437 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4438. Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4438 was sold and that Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4437 was further sub-divided into Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4647 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4648, with Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4648 being sold to a third party. Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4647 was further sub-divided into two portions namely Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4726 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4728 and that the Administrator sold and transferred Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4728. That Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/4726 was further-subdivided into Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5397 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5398. That Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5398 was later sold while Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5397 was further sub-divided resulting into two portions namely: Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5406 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5407. She referred the Court to the annexed and marked green cards DW-4 for parcels Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5406 and Land Parcel No. W. Bukusu/S. Mateka/5407.






7.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions. Both parties duly complied.






8.
I have carefully considered the application, the affidavits tendered by both parties herein, and their rival submissions. I find the main issue for determination is whether this Court can issue the orders sought.






9.
It is imperative to note that the application dated 18
th
 March 2024 seeks to reinstate a succession cause that is still ongoing. It is clear that no evidence has been availed that each party has had their respective portions physically allocated to them and a title to that effect generated. This simply means that the Succession Cause of the estate of the deceased had not yet been concluded.






10.
I wish to note that some of the averments as raised by the Applicants herein clearly cannot be dispensed with by this Court under the filed pleading. It is clear that the Applicants claims raise serious issues like the fraudulent and illegal transfer of the deceased’s property to the late Administrator and the exclusion of assets that clearly belong to the estate of the deceased from the Petitioning documents. This clearly means that the Applicants ought to approach this Court with the correct pleadings for purposes of deliberation.






11.
I’m alive to provisions of Section 73 of the Probate and Administration Rules which provides that:
“
73.
Nothing in these Rules shall limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.”






12.
It must be noted that the object of the Court is to uphold substantive justice. It is my considered view that substantive justice will be done by ensuring that the alleged assets that were left out when the proceeds of the suit property truly belonged to the estate of the deceased herein and if the Administrator had the requisite authority, Confirmed Grant, at the time she transferred the alleged assets to her name and even sold some of them.






13.
This Court cannot issue preservatory orders with regard to property that is clearly not part of the estate of the deceased that was distributed as the same is strange to it. The alleged assets were not listed in the initial petition forms and they might be in names of third parties who have not been roped into these proceedings. As regards the issue of one of the properties listed in the estate of the deceased administrator being claimed as an asset of the deceased herein, the Applicants are at liberty to challenge the same before the lower court where the cause has been filed. Either way, the Applicants would need to move the court appropriately in order to obtain the orders sought.






14.
In view of the foregoing observations, it is my finding that the Applicants’ application dated 18
th
 March, 2024 lacks merit. The same is dismissed. As parties are members of one family, i order each party to bear their own costs.
Orders accordingly.

IN THE MATTER OF CHEBOCHOK SANG (DECEASED)








Ruling










1.
This matter is traceable to Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 which initially started as Eldoret Miscellaneous Probate and Administration Cause No. 27 of 2013 and in which a petition was apparently filed respecting the Estate of the Late Chebochok Arap Sang (Deceased). The Petitioners therein were Mary Sang and Christopher Chebochok but on the 22
nd
 May 2014 the matter was stood over generally following the demise of the first Petitioner, Mary Sang, who in accordance to the petition filed in court on 20
th
 May 2013, was, the surviving widow of the deceased while the Second Petitioner, Christopher Kipleting Chebochok was listed as the surviving son of the deceased along with one Philip Koskei. The only asset listed as the estate property was Land Parcel No. Nandi/Kilibwoni/ 1373 valued at Kshs. 100,000/- at the material time.






2.
It later turned out that Eldoret Miscellaneous Probate and Administration Cause No. 27 of 2013 was not related to the estate of the deceased herein and that it was wrongly transferred to Kapsabet Court and re-opened as Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013, which was returned to the High Court at Eldoret vide its original number being Eldoret High Court Miscellaneous Probate & Administration Cause No. 27 of 2013. The necessary order was issued on 31
st
 October 2014 by the High Court at Eldoret, but it related to the estate of one Kiptanui Arap Lamai in which the disputants were one Salina Chebichi and one Mark Joseph Maritim over Estate property described as Nandi/Kamobo/ 29. However, later in 2018, when the apparent error was realized, the Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 was returned to the Kapsabet Court and left “hanging” as it were. In the meantime, the surviving Petitioner, Christopher Kipleting Chebochok, did on the 3
rd
 March 2017 file a separate petition for grant of letters of administration intestate respecting the estate of the deceased herein, the late Chebochok Sang. This was done vide PMCC Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017 in which the Petitioner who is the Respondent in the present case, being High Court Probate & Administration Case No. 31 of 2021 at Kapsabet, was the sole Petitioner and was listed as the surviving son of the deceased together with a surviving daughter of the deceased called Elizeba Cherotich Kutto. The sole estate property was said to be the parcel land described as Nandi/Kilobw
oni/1373
 valued at the time at Kshs. 6million, but encumbered with liabilities to one Simon Kipkemboi Biego and Renny Kipchumba Kogo.






3.
The necessary grant of letters of Administration intestate was issued to the Petitioner/ Respondent on 12
th
 June 2017 by the Magistrate’s Court at Kapsabet and was confirmed on 23
rd
 January 2018 with the estate property No. Nandi/Ki
libwoni/1373
 being wholly distributed to the Petitioner together with an additional property described as Nandi/Ki
libwoni/1374
 which was not listed in the Petition as being available for distribution.
The confirmation of the grant marked the “closure” of Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017 which together with Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 were called for by this court for perusal and it was upon such perusal that all the foregoing factual information was yielded.
It is intriguing that the Petitioner/ Respondent was the sole beneficiary of the confirmation of the grant as reflected in the certificate of confirmation of grant dated 23
rd
 January 2018, yet in the petition dated 3
rd
 March 2017 the deceased was said to have been survived by the Petitioner as the only son and a daughter, Elizeba Cherotich and that the Estate was indebted or liable to Simion Kipkemboi Biego and Renny Kipchumba Kogo.






4.
Further, in Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 which stalled the petition indicated that the deceased was survived by a widow Mary Sang (deceased) and two sons i.e. the Petitioner/ Respondent and one Philip Kosgei. The accompanying, chiefs letter dated 12
th
 March 2013, indicated that there were two parcels of land viz Nandi/Ki
libwoni/1033
 and Nandi/Ki
libwoni/1034
 and five (5) beneficiaries of the estate, being the surviving widow, two sons, one daughter and a purchaser of Parcels No. Nandi/Ki
libwoni/1034
 i.e. one John Kiprugut Kurgat.
The letter also indicated that the deceased was a polygamist with two wives including the surviving widow. The name of the departed wife was not mentioned.






5.
The present cause which started before the High Court at Eldoret as Miscellaneous Succession Cause NO. 9 of 2018 and anchored on Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017 as may be deciphered from all the foregoing had its genesis in Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 and is a byproduct of the activities or processes in both Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 45 of 2013 and Kapsabet Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017 which were all before the Magistrate’s Court. Thus, Kapsabet Cause No. 45 of 2013 gave rise to Kapsabet Case No. 38 of 2017 which in turn gave rise to this Kapsabet High Court Succession Cause No. 31 of 2021 through Eldoret Miscellaneous Cause No. 9 of 2018, a suit filed by the Objector/Applicant Sarah Jepkinyor Kosgei against the Respondent/Petitioner herein on the 19
th
 March 2018 for revocation and/or annulment of the grant of letters of administration intestate issued on 12
th
 June, 2017 and the accruing certificate of confirmation of grant issued on 23
rd
 January 2018 and not 23
rd
 February 2018 as erroneously indicated in the appropriate summons for revocation of grant dated 19
th
 March 2018.






6.
This is the summons subject of this ruling after an inter-parties hearing thereof by way of affidavit evidence and written submissions.
At the hearing, the Applicant/Objector was represented by the Learned Counsel, Mr. Rotich while the Respondent/Petitioner or administrator represented himself through Zenah Jeptoo, vide a duly executed power of attorney dated 23
rd
 July 2024.
Having considered the application on the basis of the supporting grounds and those in opposition thereto as canvassed in the rival written submissions with brief oral highlights from the parties, this court identified two issues for determination, Firstly, whether the application is competent and proper before this court and Secondly, whether the Applicant has demonstrated sufficient grounds for revocation and/ or annulment of the grant and the certificate of confirmation of grant issued to the Respondent/ Administrator in terms of Section 76 of the 
Law of Succession Act
.






7.
With regard to the first issue, it must be pointed out that the necessity to open this file at this court did not arise as there was already in existence Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017 at the Kapsabet Magistrate Court in which the impugned grant was issued and confirmed. The Applicant ought to have sought revocation of the grant within that cause instead of filing the present application in this court in a new file away from the jurisdiction of the magistrate court. Accordingly, the application would not be proper and competent before this court for the major reason that this court lacks the necessary jurisdiction to in the first instance revoke and/ or annul a grant issued and confirmed by the Magistrate court by dint of the amendment of the 
Law of Succession Act
 on the 2
nd
 January 2016 which brought into force the Magistrate’s Courts 
Act No. 26 of 2015
.






8.
This 
Act No. 26 of 2015
, amended and repeated Section 48 (1) of the 
Law of Succession Act
 by providing under Section 23 that:
“
(i)
Notwithstanding any other written law which limits jurisdiction, but subject to the provisions of Section 49 a magistrate shall have jurisdiction to entertain any application and to determine any dispute under this Act and pronounce such decrees and make such orders therein as may be expedient in respect of any estate the gross value of which does not exceed the pecuniary limit prescribed under Section 7(1) of the Magistrate’s Courts Act 2015”






9.
Previously, Section 48 (1) of the 
Law of Succession Act
 had granted exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court to revoke grants made by the Magistrate Court. The jurisdiction was extended to the Magistrate’s Court by the aforementioned amendment in the year 2016. The subject grant was issued in the year 2017 and confirmed in the year 2018, when the High Court had already lost its original and exclusive jurisdiction to revoke grants made and issued by the Magistrate’s Courts. Thus, in the year 2016, the Magistrate Courts were clothed with jurisdiction to revoke grants made by themselves. Such jurisdiction could only be exercised by the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction which is not the case herein.






10.
Ultimately, this court must and hereby divests itself of the jurisdiction to deal with this matter and must now down its tools at his stage and order that the present application dated 19
th
 March 2018 be struck out and dismissed for being incompetent and improper before this court. This is without prejudice to the Applicant refiling or filing a fresh application for revocation of the impugned grant in the magistrate’s court at Kapsabet within Succession Cause No. 38 of 2017.
Having arrived at that conclusion which regard to the first issue for determination, the determination of the second issue is no longer necessary as this court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter and would resist any temptation to deal or delve in matters which are not proper before itself.
In sum this application is dismissed. The parties shall bear own costs of the application.

 May 2022, the Appellants herein filed a Memorandum of Appeal dated 9
th
 May 2022. They relied on five (5) Grounds of Appeal. They filed their Supplementary Record of Appeal dated 23
rd
 April 2024 on 30
th
 April 2024.






3.
Their Written Submissions were dated 16
th
 February 2014 and filed on 20
th
 February 2024. Their Supplementary Written Submissions were dated 23
rd
 April 2024 and filed on 30
th
 April 2024. The Respondents’ Written Submissions were dated 9
th
 April 2024 and filed on 5
th
 June 2024. The Judgment herein is based on the said Written Submissions which the parties relied upon in their entirety.








Legal Analysis


4.
It is settled law that the duty of a first appellate court is to evaluate afresh the evidence adduced before the trial court in order to arrive at its own independent conclusion but bearing in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify.






5.
This was aptly stated in the case of Selle & Another vs Associated Motor Boat Co Ltd & Others [1968] EA 123 where the court therein held that the appellate court was not bound by the findings of fact of the trial court but that in re-considering and re-evaluating the evidence so as to draw its own conclusions, it always had to bear in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses and thus make due allowance in that respect.






6.
Having looked at the Grounds of Appeal and the respective parties’ Written Submissions, it appeared to this court that the only issue that had been placed before it for determination was whether or not the quantum that was awarded was excessive in the circumstances warranting interference by this court. The court deemed it prudent to address the issue under the following distinct heads.








I. 
Law Reform Act
 Cap 26 (laws Of Kenya)


7.
This court considered the award under the 
Law Reform Act
 under the following distinct and separate heads.








A. Loss Of Expectation Of Life


8.
The Appellants submitted that the Trial Court grossly misdirected itself and treated the evidence and submissions on quantum superficially consequently arriving at a wrong conclusion.






9.
They contended that the general principle of law was that for an appellate court to interfere with an award of damages, it must be shown that the trial court in awarding damages took into consideration an irrelevant fact or the sum awarded was inordinately low or too high that was a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage, or if it was established that a wrong principle of law was applied as held in the case of Butt vs Khan [1981] KLR 349.






10.
They pointed out that damages should represent a fair compensation and not be excessive. In this regard, they cited the case of Osman Mohammed & Another vs Saluro Bundit Mohammed Civil Appeal No 30 of 1997 (eKLR citation not given) where it was held that damages had to be within limits set out by the decided cases and also within limits the Kenyan economy could afford.






11.
They submitted that the Trial Court erred by awarding Kshs 100,000/= for loss of expectation of life as the same was a bit excessive. They submitted that Kshs 80,000/= would be sufficient in the circumstances. They relied on the case of Chen Wembo & 2 Others vs I.K.K & Another (Suing as the Administrator and Personal Representative of CRK (deceased) [2017] eKLR where the court upheld the award of Kshs 80,000/= for loss of expectation of life for being within the conventional standard.






12.
On their part, the Respondents submitted that they had initially proposed a sum of Kshs 250,000/= for loss of expectation of life. They contended that given her young age, the deceased suffered loss of an illustrious life. They averred that the Appellants had failed to set out any relevant fact which the Trial Court omitted or any irrelevant fact which the Trial Court took into consideration in making the award for loss of expectation of life. It was their case that the Trial Court’s award of Kshs 100,000/= was not excessive and urged this court to uphold the same.






13.
To buttress their argument, they placed reliance on the cases of In Yaf Japan Motors Limited & 2 Others vs Wambugha & Another KEHC 22438 KLR where the court upheld an award of Kshs 200,000/= for loss of expectation of life, Violet Jeptum Rahedi vs Gilbert Kubai Mbogori[2013]eKLR where a sum of Kshs 150,000/= was found to have been reasonable for loss of expectation of life and Lawrence Theuri Mwangi (Suing as the Personal Representative of the Estate of the Late Benson Mwangi Theuri (Deceased) vs Thomas Mutunga Musau t/a Tenoji Motors Ltd & Another [2019]eKLR where an award of Kshs 120,000/= was made under this head.






14.
Right at the outset, this court wished to point out that while an appellate court ought to determine whether or not the trial court exercised its discretion or did not misdirect itself on the basis of the material that was adduced during trial, nothing stopped it from re-evaluating the evidence that had been adduced vis a vis considering comparable awards and coming to its own conclusion as was held in the cases of Selle & Another vs Associated Motor Boat Co Ltd & Others (Supra) and Kenya Ports Authority vs Kushton (K) Ltd (2009) 2 EA 212






15.
It was this court’s considered view that the Appellant’s proposal would be on the lower side in view of the inflationary trends. On the other hand, the award of Kshs 100,000/= for loss of expectation of life was not unreasonable.






16.
In arriving at this figure, this court associated itself with the holdings in the following cases:-
1.
Joseph Mugweru Njenga & Another vs Joseph Kamau Ng’ang’a [2018] eKLR where the court therein awarded a sum of Kshs 100,000/= for loss of expectation of life.
2.
Pleasant View School Limited v Rose Mutheu Kithoi & another [2017] eKLR, where this very court upheld an award of loss of expectation of life at the sum of Kshs 100,000/=.








II. 
Fatal Accidents Act
 Cap 32 (laws Of Kenya)


17.
This court considered the award under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
 under the following distinct and separate heads.








A. Multiplicand


18.
The Appellants submitted that the Trial Court erred by forming an opinion that the deceased was earning Kshs 20,000/= per month prior to her death and further erred by awarding Kshs 15,000/= as perceived income prior to her death, without evidence in both instances. They argued that although Margret Ngesa Undusu (hereinafter referred to as “PW 1”) testified that the deceased was a teacher employed by BOM and earned Kshs 15,000/=, he did not adduce any pay slips to confirm the said monthly pay.






19.
They argued that in the absence of evidence of proof of earning of the deceased, the Trial Court ought to have reverted to the minimum wage of Kshs 13,572.90 for a general labourer, for all other areas as per the Regulation of Wages (General) (Amendment Order) 2018 (Legal Notice Number 2) under the column of a general labourer as the monthly income of the deceased prior to her death.






20.
They were emphatic that the College Leaving Certificate from Kaimosi Teachers College and the letter from Visiru Primary School in the Supplementary Record of Appeal dated 23
rd
 April 2024 purporting to confirm that the deceased was a teacher and worked at the said Visiru Primary School where she was earning Kshs 15,000/= per month was not conclusive proof of her earning in the absence of a letter of appointment or a copy of pay slip from the said school. They urged the court not to rely on the said documents in determining her monthly income prior to her death.






21.
On their part, the Respondents submitted that the Appellants had clearly misrepresented the Trial Court’s finding on the deceased’s earnings. They averred that his assertion that the Trial pegged the monthly income of the deceased at Kshs 15,000/= without any evidence was erroneous as in their list of documents at item (q) there was the letter from Virisu (sic) Primary School where the deceased was a Board Management Retained Teacher and which was produced as exhibit by consent.






22.
They further pointed out that they produced the deceased’s Certificate from the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) which showed that she was a registered teacher. They pointed out that she had not been deployed to teach but she would have earned more in the future. They produced her college certificate showing that she qualified as a P1 teacher.






23.
Notably, PW 1 testified that the deceased, who was her daughter, died as a result of the accident that occurred on 21
st
 June 2017. She stated that the deceased was thirty (30) years of age at the time of her death was employed as a teacher by BOM and was earning a monthly income of Kshs 15,000/=. However, she did not produce any pay slips to show how much the deceased earned monthly.






24.
So as to determine what was the appropriate multiplicand in this matter, this court had due regard to the case of Jacob Ayiga Maruja & Another vs Simeon Obayo [2005] eKLR where the Court of Appeal rendered itself on the question of failure to adduce proof of income. It stated that it did not subscribe to the view that the only way to prove the profession of a person had to be by the production of certificates and that the only way of proving earnings was by production of documents as this would occasion a lot of injustice to very many Kenyans who were illiterate and kept no records yet they earned their livelihood in various ways.






25.
In that case the Court of Appeal found that the evidence of the respondent and the widow coupled with the production of school reports was sufficient material to amount to strict proof for the damages claimed.






26.
In the absence of any contrary evidence from the Appellants, this court was persuaded to believe the Respondents’ testimony that the deceased was a teacher. However, it was not clear if she earned Kshs 15,000/= monthly.






27.
Although the Trial Court relied on the testimony of PW 1, and awarded Kshs 15,000/= as the amount the deceased earned monthly, it did not give reasons for having arrived at the said conclusion. It is important that reasons are given for each determination to enable the appellate court understand the reasoning of such decision and therefore determine whether the determination was correct or not.






28.
Notably, Order 21 Rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 stipulates as follows:-
“
Judgments in defended suits shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.”






29.
Under the Regulation of Wages (General) (Amendment Order) 2018 (Legal Notice Number 2) which was applicable regulation herein as the deceased died on 21
st
 June 2017, the minimum wage for general labourers in all other areas was Kshs 6, 896.15. Having determined that the deceased was a teacher and had certification from the TSC, a sum of Kshs 15,000/= was not unreasonable as a salary of a teacher in a primary school. Indeed, a teacher could not be deemed to have been at the level to earn a minimum wage, which was applicable to general labourers who may be unskilled. This court therefore left the multiplicand of Kshs 15,000/= undisturbed.








B. Multiplier


30.
The Appellants pointed out that the Trial Court also erred when awarded a multiplier of thirty (30) years on the basis of life expectancy at sixty (60) years. It was emphatic that the said award was unjustifiable. They asserted that their opinion that the deceased would have lived up to forty five (45) years had it not been for the accident was reasonable.






31.
To buttress their point, they relied on the case of Shiva Carriers Ltd vs Loise Jepkoech Sang & Another [2018]eKLR where the court cited with approval the case of Hanna Wangaturi Moche & Another vs Nelson Muya Nairobi HCCC No 4533/1993 (eKLR citation not given) where it was held that in determining the right multiplier, the right approach was to consider the age of the deceased, the balance of earning life, the age of the dependants, the life expected, length of dependency, the vicissitudes of life and factor accelerated by payment in lumpsum.






32.
On their part, the Respondents argued that the age of the deceased at the time of death was not challenged by the Respondents. They asserted that the retirement age in Kenya was sixty (60) years and that the post mortem report showed that the deceased had normal nutrition and physique and had no adverse medical findings and/or disease on her body save for injuries from the accident. They invited the court to take judicial notice of the vast developments in medical arena that had improved people’s way of life in our country and the fact that there were many retirees living and working beyond sixty (60) years of age.






33.
They argued that taking away fifteen (15) years was not only punitive but also negated the deceased’s robust life expectancy on mere speculation that she would not have lived until sixty (60) years. They contended that the multiplier of thirty (30) years was warranted. They urged the court to uphold the same and/or in the alternative, adopt a multiplier of not less than twenty eight (28) years.






34.
In determining whether or not the Trial Court exercised its discretion judiciously, this court had due regard to the case of Patrice Ombogo Bundi & Another (suing as the Personal representatives of the Estate of Douglas Bundi Ombogo) vs The Guardian Coach Limited [2022] eKLR in which it adopted a multiplier of sixteen (16) years where the deceased therein was aged thirty six (36) years at the time of death.






35.
This court also had due regard to the case of Joseph Njuguna Mwaura vs Builders Den Limited & Another [2014] eKLR where the court adopted a multiplier of seventeen (17) years where the deceased was aged thirty five (35) years at the time of death.






36.
In the case of James Njiiri & 2 Others vs FPU & Another [2019] eKLR, the deceased therein was aged twenty nine (29) years at the time of his death. The appellate court therein adopted a multiplier of thirty one (31) years.






37.
As was seen hereinabove, there was no clear-cut formula of assessing what the appropriate multiplier would be. However, courts had to be guided by comparable cases so to arrive at conclusions that were not so wide apart as to cause inconsistency and confusion to those relying on the decisions.






38.
Taking into account all the past decisions relating to the issue of a multiplier, this court agreed with the Appellants herein that the multiplier of thirty (30) years where a person was aged thirty (30) years at the time of her death was disproportionate and not comparable to past decisions where the persons died at the same age as the deceased herein.






39.
This court therefore found and held that the Trial Court misdirected itself in having adopted a multiplier of thirty (30) years and there was therefore merit in disturbing the said figure as it did appear to this court that the Trial Court did not take into account the vagaries of life that could have shortened the deceased’s life as a teacher.






40.
On the other hand, a multiplier of fifteen (15) years as had been proposed by the Appellants was on the lower side.






41.
Taking the uncertainties and vagaries of life into consideration, this court determined that a multiplier of twenty (20) years was fair in the circumstances of the case herein.






42.
In arriving at the said conclusion, this court considered the following cases:-
1.
In the case of Bash Hauliers vs Dama Kalume Karisa & another [2020] eKLR, the appellate court upheld a multiplier of twenty (20) years where the deceased therein was aged thirty two (32) years at the time of his death.
2.
In the case of Pleasant View School Limited vs Rose Mutheu Kithoi & Another (Supra), this very court left undisturbed the multiplier of twenty (20) years where the deceased was thirty six (36) years.








C. Dependency Ratio


43.
The Appellants submitted that as the deceased was not married and did not have children but was taking care of her mother and siblings, a dependency ratio of 2/3 applied was applicable.






44.
On their part, the Respondents submitted that the issue of the support the deceased accorded her family was not challenged in cross-examination and remained uncontroverted facts.






45.
The Appellants did not appear to have objected to the ratio of 2/3 that was awarded under this head. However, there was a general inclination by courts to adopt a dependency ratio of 1/3 where a deceased had been unmarried and had no children while 2/3 was reserved for deceased persons who had been married with children.






46.
In arriving at this conclusion, this court had due regard to the following cases:-
1.
Petronila Muli v Richard Muindi Savi & Catherine Mwende Mwindu [2021] eKLR where the court adopted a dependence ratio of 1/3 where the deceased was unmarried and took care of her parents.
2.
Dismas Muhami Wainarua v Sopon Kasirimo Maranta (Suing as administrator and or personal representative of the estate of Partinini Supon (Deceased) [2021] eKLR where the appellate court rejected the dependency ratio of ½ as there was no proof that the deceased supported his parents to that extent and adopted 1/3 dependency ratio.
3.
Rodgers Kinoti v Linus Bundi Murithi & another [2022] eKLR where the appellate court substituted the 2/3 dependency ratio that was awarded by the trial court with 1/3 dependence ratio where the deceased was unmarried.






47.
As the Appellants were not objecting to the dependency ratio of 2/3, this court left the same undisturbed.








III. Special Damages


48.
The Appellants submitted that the Trial Court erred by awarding the Respondents Kshs 210,500/= yet the Respondents had pleaded special damages in the sum of only Kshs 160,500/=. In this regard, they cited the case of 
Agroline Hauliers Limited & Joseph Opiyo Omollo vs Michael Abongo Kisemba Migori HCCA No 6 of 2015
 where it was held that special damages must be pleaded and proved.






49.
On her part, the Respondent submitted that there was no appeal against the award of special damages and therefore invited the court to dismiss the appeal against the said award.






50.
The Trial Court indicated that the Respondents had pleaded and proved a sum of Kshs 210,500/=. It, however, failed to justify of how it had arrived to the aforesaid amount. This court noted that the receipts the Respondents adduced as proof of the claim for Special damages did not amount to Kshs 210,500/=. The receipts that were legible to the court amounted to the sum of Kshs 200,500/=. They had pleaded for special damages in the sum of Kshs 160,500/=.






51.
The Appellants had therefore demonstrated that there was a lawful basis to interfere with the finding of the Trial Court in this regard as special damages had to be specifically pleaded and specifically proven. In this regard, this court found and held that the Respondents were only entitled to the sum of Kshs 160,500/= which the Appellant conceded to and was within the receipts of Kshs 200,500/= that they tendered in support of their claim for special damages.






52.
The Respondents’ argument that the Appellants had not appealed the award of special damages fell on the wayside as the Memorandum of Appeal showed that the Appellants appealed on quantum and/or damages generally which in the mind of this court was inclusive of the award on special damages.








Disposition


53.
For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Appellants’ Appeal dated 9
th
 May 2022 that was lodged on 11
th
 May 2022 was merited. The effect of this is that the Judgment of Kshs 3,950,500/= that was entered by the Learned Trial Magistrate in Vihiga PMCC No 213 of 2019 on 14
th
 April 2022 in favour of the Respondents herein against the Appellants herein be and is hereby set aside and/or vacated and the same be and is hereby replaced with a decision that Judgment that be and is hereby entered in favour of the Respondents herein against the Appellants herein jointly and severally for the sum of Kshs 2,710,500/= made up as follows:-
Pain and Suffering Kshs 50,000/=
Loss of Expectation of Life Kshs 100,000/=
Loss of Dependency Kshs 2,400,000/=
2/3 x 15,000 x12 x 20
Special Damages Kshs 160,500/=
Kshs 2,710,500/=
Plus costs and interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, interest on special damages will accrue at court rates from the date of filing suit while damages under the 
Fatal Accidents Act
 Cap 32 (Laws of Kenya) and the 
Law Reform Act
 Cap 26 (Laws of Kenya) will accrue interest at court rates from the date of judgment of the lower court until payment in full.






54.
As the Appellants partly succeeded in their Appeal herein, it is hereby directed that parties will bear their respective own costs of the Appeal herein.






55.
It is so ordered.

Ruling








(on motion dated 30/10/2024)


1.
The 1
st
 2
nd
 and  3
rd
 Appellants’ Notice of Motion dated 3
rd
 October 2023 seek to have the 3
rd
 Respondent Hon. Kanini Kega  cited for contempt of this court’s orders of 13
th
 July 2023 and to be committed to civil jail for a period of six (6) months. The Applicants further pray for such other or further appropriate reliefs as the court may deem fit and costs of the application. The application is brought under Articles Sections 1A, 1B, 3A & 63 (e) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, Section 5 of the 
Judicature Act
, Cap 8 Laws of Kenya and all other enabling provisions of the law.






2.
The application is based on the grounds on its face and supported by the Affidavit of the 1
st
 Applicant Hon. Jeremiah Kioni.  He avers  that on 13
th
 July 2023 Lady Justice Asenath Ongeri issued conservatory orders directing that status quo of the leadership of the Jubilee Party be maintained as outlined in Gazette Notice No. 3195 of 22
nd
 March 2022, and staying the Gazette Notice No. 9131 of 2023, published in the Special Issue Vol. CXXV-161 on 12
th
 July 2023, and any related instructions, decisions, or actions, pending the hearing and determination of the application dated 12
th
 July 2023. He asserted that pursuant to the conservatory orders, the treasurer and the Secretary General of the Jubilee party remain as Mr. Kagwe Gichohi and himself respectively.






3.
Further, the 1
st
 Applicant averred that the Order of 13
th
 July 2023 was duly served on all parties who acknowledged receipt and filed their responses to the application dated 12
th
 July 2023. However, in blatant disregard of the court's orders, he deposes that  on 31
st
 August 2023 the 3
rd
 Respondent, Hon. Kanini Kega, wrote a letter in which he purported to nominate Hon. Dr. Rachael Nyamai, Kwenya Thuku, and Ruweida Mohammed as representatives of the Jubilee Party to the Annual General Meeting of the Centre for Multi-Party Democracy in Kenya, a role reserved exclusively for the party's Secretary General. He further states that the 3
rd
 Respondent also published the financial position of the Jubilee Party for the financial year ending 30
th
 June 2023 in local daily newspapers, thereby presenting himself as the party's Treasurer. The Applicants aver that these are deliberate collateral attacks on the adjudicatory authority of this court that unless immediately punished, will irreparably undermine the authority of this court and  additionally that, unless the contempt is purged their appeal will be rendered nugatory.






4.
In opposition to the application, the 3
rd
 Respondent Hon. Kanini Kega filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by the party’s Chairperson, Nelson Dzuya on 16
th
 October 2023. He asserted that the letter dated 31
st
 August 2023 is not genuine and was neither authored by the 3
rd
 Respondent nor issued by the 4
th
 Appellant. He pointed out that the letter lacks a stamp, and the signature thereon appears to have been electronically pasted. Further, he stated that on 31
st
 August 2023 the 4
th
 Appellant received an invitation from the Centre for Multiparty Democracy (CMD-KENYA) for an annual general meeting which was scheduled for 15
th
 September 2023. Pursuant to the powers granted by Article 10.3 (7) of the Jubilee Party Constitution, he nominated Hon. Dr. Rachael Nyamai, Hon. Kwenya Thuku, and Hon. Ruwaida Mohamed as the Party’s delegates to the AGM. Additionally, he  denied that the 3
rd
 Respondent published the party's financial statements stating that the same were published in compliance with the Jubilee Party’s statutory obligations and did not bear the 3
rd
 Respondent's name. He contended that the application is an abuse of court process and is intended to delay the hearing and determination of the Applicants’ Application dated 12
th
 July 2023 as well as the entire Appeal in an effort to prolong their enjoyment of the conservatory orders to the detriment of the Jubilee Party.






5.
The 3
rd
 Respondent further swore and filed his Replying Affidavit sworn on 16
th
 October 2023, stating that he is the National Director of Elections and a member of the National Executive Committee of the Jubilee Party. His response largely reiterated the arguments made by the 4
th
 Appellant hereinabove. In addition, the 3
rd
 Respondent accused the 1
st
 Appellant of engaging in a smear campaign against him.






6.
The court has carefully considered the application, the Affidavits sworn in support and in opposition thereto as well as the parties’ respective written submissions.






7.
The main issue for determination is whether the third Respondent is in contempt of orders issued by this court on 13
th
 July 2023.






8.
Contempt of court is conduct or action that defies or disrespects authority of court. Black’s Law Dictionary 9
th
 Edition, defines contempt as:
“
The act or state of despising; the conduct of being despised. Conduct that defies the authority or dignity of a court or legislature. Because such conduct interferes with the administration of justice.”






9.
Section 5 (1) of the 
Judicature Act
 Cap 8 Laws of Kenya confers on this court the jurisdiction to punish for contempt in the following terms: -
“
(1)
The High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have the same power to punish for contempt of court as is for the time being possessed by the High Court of Justice in England, and that power shall extend to upholding the authority and dignity of subordinate courts.”






10.
Courts punish for contempt to uphold the dignity and authority of the court, ensure compliance with directions of the court, observance and respect of due process of law, preserve an effective and impartial system of justice, and maintain public confidence in the administration of justice by courts: See Sheila Cassatt Issenberg & another v Antony Machatha Kinyanjui [2021] eKLR. Additionally, in the case of Samuel M. N. Mweru & Others v National Land Commission & 2 others [2020] eKLR cited by the 3
rd
 Respondent herein, Mativo J. pronounced himself as follows:
“


46.
Contempt of court is not merely a mechanism for the enforcement of court orders. The jurisdiction of the superior courts to commit recalcitrant litigants for contempt of court when they fail or refuse to obey court orders has at its heart the very effectiveness and legitimacy of the judicial system. That, in turn, means that the court called upon to commit such a litigant for his or her contempt is not only dealing with the individual interest of the frustrated successful litigant but also, as importantly, acting as guardian of the public interest. 
[49]
”








11.
In the case of Samuel M. N. Mweru Case (Supra), Mativo J. set down the test for contempt as follows:
“


40.
It is an established principle of law that 
[45]
 in order to succeed in civil contempt proceedings, the applicant has to prove (i) the terms of the order, (ii) Knowledge of these terms by the Respondent, (iii). Failure by the Respondent to comply with the terms of the order. Upon proof of these requirements the presence of willfulness and bad faith on the part of the Respondent would normally be inferred, but the Respondent could rebut this inference by contrary proof on a balance of probabilities. 
[46]
 Perhaps the most comprehensive of the elements of civil contempt was stated by the learned authors of the book Contempt in Modern New Zealand 
[47]
 who succinctly stated: -




“There are essentially four elements that must be proved to make the case for civil contempt. The applicant must prove to the required standard (in civil contempt cases which is higher than civil cases) that: -
a.
the terms of the order (or injunction or undertaking) were clear and unambiguous and were binding on the defendant;
b.
the defendant had knowledge of or proper notice of the terms of the order;
c.
the defendant has acted in breach of the terms of the order; and
d.
the defendant's conduct was deliberate.”






12.
Further, in the Sheila Cassatt Issenberg case (supra) the court cited with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of India in Mahinderjit Singh Bitta v Union of India & Others 1 A NO. 10 of 2010 (13
th
 October, 2011) where it was stated that:
“
In exercise of its contempt jurisdiction, the courts are primarily concerned with enquiring whether the contemnor is guilty of intentional and willful violation of the order of the court, even to constitute a civil contempt. Every party is listed before the court and even otherwise, is expected to obey the orders of the court in its spirit and substance. Every person is required to respect and obey the orders of the court with due dignity for the institution.” (Emphasis).






13.
In the present case, it is disputed that on 13
th
 July 2023, Lady Justice Asenath Ongeri issued orders directing that the leadership of the Jubilee Party remains as outlined in Gazette Notice No. 3195 of 22
nd
 March 2022, and staying the Gazette Notice No. 9131 of 2023, published in the Special Issue Vol. CXXV-161 on 12
th
 July 2023, and any related instructions, decisions, or actions, pending the hearing and determination of the Applicants application dated 12
th
 July 2023.






14.
The Applicants allege that the 3
rd
 Respondent disobeyed these court orders by performing duties reserved for the Secretary General and the Treasurer of the Jubilee Party. However, this allegation was rebutted by both the 3
rd
 Respondent and the chairperson of the 4
th
 Appellant. Notably, the 3
rd
 Respondent’s assertion that the letter dated 31
st
 August 2023 was not genuine is supported by the Party’s Chairperson, who confirmed that he was the one who nominated the members of the Party that attended the Annual General Meeting for the Centre for Multi-Party Democracy Kenya in accordance with the Party’s Constitution. The chairperson provided his letter dated 31
st
 August 2023, whose content is similar to the letter allegedly authoured by the 3
rd
 Respondent, save for the signature and the absence of the stamps thereon.






15.
Additionally, the court notes that the 3
rd
 Respondent’s claim that he did not publish the Party’s financial statements in the standard Newspaper is corroborated by the Party’s Chairperson in his Replying affidavit who was categorical that the publication was done in compliance with the Party’s statutory obligations and not by the 3
rd
 Respondent. Indeed, the court confirms that there is nothing in that Newspaper publication to suggest that the financial statements of the Jubilee Party were published by the 3
rd
 Respondent as alleged. The Applicants did not tender any further evidence to substantiate this allegation.






16.
Further, the court notes that the Applicants did not challenge the assertions by the 3
rd
 Respondent and the Chairperson of the Jubilee Party in any way whatsoever. As the Applicants are the ones who alleged contempt of the court orders, and given that contempt, if proved, can lead to serious consequences including  loss of liberty, the burden of proof lay on the Applicants to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the 3
rd
 Respondent had violated the court orders of 13
th
 July 2023 as provided at Sections 107-109 of the 
Evidence Act
. The court therefore finds that the Applicants have failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the 3
rd
 Respondent willfully or at all disobeyed the said court orders.






17.
For the foregoing, the court finds no merit in the 1
st
 to 3
rd
 Appellants’ Notice of Motion dated 3
rd
 October 2023. It is dismissed.






18.
On costs, the dispute arising from inter party wrangles on leadership of the Jubilee party, an order is issued that each party bears their own costs thereof.

Ruling










1.
In his Notice of Motion application dated 14
th
 February 2024 and filed on 15
th
 February 2024, the Petitioner herein sought for orders that pending the hearing of the Petition herein, a conservatory order of injunction do issue to restrain the Respondents, their agents and/or assigns from awarding, commissioning, paying or in any other manner acting on bids received in respect of the re-advertisement of the tenders advertised on 26
th
 October 2023 and subsequently re-advertised on 12
th
 January 2024 before releasing the results of the bids submitted by its members for the tender advertised on 26
th
 October 2023.






2.
Rasheed Obongo Hassan, the Petitioner’s Chairman, swore an affidavit in support of the said application herein on 14
th
 February 2024 on his own behalf and on behalf of the Petitioner’s members.






3.
The Petitioner asserted that the 2
nd
 Respondent had caused to be advertised tenders for several works for the benefit of the residents of Vihiga County and that its members submitted their bids through the IFMIS system. However, some of the bids were never opened. It averred that as its members were awaiting communication, they came across another notice for re-advertisement re-advertising the same works. It also established that some works done.






4.
It contended that the Respondents were expected to adhere to the guiding principles in Section 3 of the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
 in dealing with its members. It averred that the Respondents had breached their rights under Article 27, 43 and 47 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya as the re-advertisement was an administrative action which ought to pass the test in Article 47(2) of 
the Constitution
.






5.
It was emphatic that its members had been denied equal protection of the law and had been discriminated against by the Respondents pursuant to Article 27(1) of 
the Constitution
.






6.
It was emphatic that it had a good case as the Petition had a high chance of success as its members’ economic rights were under threat. It was its contention that the Respondents were acting contrary to Article 174 of 
the Constitution
 and that it was therefore in the interest of justice that the conservatory order of injunction be issued and that the re-advertisement and consequential actions therefrom be stayed pending the hearing of this Petition.






7.
On 26
th
 February 2024, Rodger Etale Christopher Tunya, Chief Officer in charge of the Department of Transport and Infrastructure, Vihiga County, swore a Replying Affidavit on behalf of the 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Respondents and in opposition to the Petitioner’s application. The same was filed on even date.






8.
They denied the existence of the position the Petitioner referred to as “Chief Officer Roads” as the 2
nd
 Respondent as was indicated in the Petition herein and that if there was such a position, then they were not responsible for the transactions which had prompted the Petition herein. They contended that the said joinder or misjoinder of the said 2
nd
 Respondent confirmed that the Petition was being maintained by a party acting on untrue and unverified facts before the court or was on a mission to abuse the court’s process and should be denied the right of audience for all purposes.






9.
They explained that they advertised and invited tenders for a total of ninety three (93) projects for the financial year 2023/2024 across the twenty five (25) wards of the County and that a total of sixty (60) bids were successful and were duly awarded. They pointed out that the unsuccessful bidders were duly notified of the position through the IFMIS platform that was used to advertise and receive the bids. They asserted that among those that were successful, a number of them were members of the Petitioner and upon being notified, they commenced the work immediately and were at different stages of completion.






10.
They were categorical that save for the reservations of the special classes specified by law, they had no preference for members of the Petitioner or a prior agreement to accord it or its members special treatment in the manner advanced in the Petition herein. They added that twenty three (23) were unsuccessful and were not awarded but were re-advertised in the county website as provided by law. They were emphatic that the Petitioner was aware of all those facts at the time of filing the Petition or it would have been provided with the information upon request through the correct channel and/or procedure.






11.
They further stated that the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
 contained procedures for addressing the nature of the complaints that had been raised in the Petition herein, the first action for redress being that the complaint had to be first preferred to the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board as provided in Section 28 and 167 of the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
, which procedure the Petitioner had ignored in favour of the Petition.






12.
They further argued that this court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Petition herein for the reason that the Petitioner had not exhausted the aforesaid procedures provided for by the Act and that the Petition lacked supporting evidence of the legal existence of the association. They urged the court to struck out and/or dismiss the Petitioner’s application with costs.






13.
Rasheed Obongo Hassan also swore a Supplimentary (sic) Affidavit on 6
th
 March 2024. The same was filed on 7
th
 March 2024.






14.
The Petitioner reiterated the averments in the deponent’s supporting affidavit and averred that the misdescription, non-joinder or misjoinder of the 2
nd
 Respondent was not fatal to the Petition herein.






15.
It pointed out that the said issues that had been raised went beyond Section 28 of the 
Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act
 and that the provisions therein did not oust the jurisdiction of this court to deal with constitutional matters under Article 23 and 165 of 
the Constitution
. He was emphatic that the Petition raised constitutional issues that ought to be decided by this court.






16.
The Petitioner’s Written Submissions were dated and filed on 24
th
 March 2024 while those of the Respondents were dated and filed on 4
th
 March 2024. This Ruling is based on the said Written Submissions which both parties relied upon in their entirety.






Legal Analysis


17.
The Petitioner cited the case of Gitarau Peter Munya vs Dicson Mwenda Kibinji & 3 Others Applicati
on No 5 of 2014
(eKLR citation not given) where the Supreme court held that conservatory orders should be granted on the inherent merit of a case, bearing in mind the public interest, constitutional values and the proportionate magnitudes and priority levels attributable to the relevant courses.






18.
It submitted that the actions that were taken by the Respondents were against public interest which this court was enjoined by 
the Constitution
 to protect and consequently protect the public good. It was his contention that the Petition herein had met the principles that were set out in the case of Gitarau Peter Munya vs Dicson Mwenda Kibinji & 3 Others (Supra).






19.
On their part, the Respondents submitted that whereas the Petitioner’s application had sought conservatory orders with the aim of stopping the contracts already awarded and the new contracts from being awarded, and that all the tenders which had been advertised earlier had been re-advertised, the true position was that out of the ninety three (93) tenders, sixty (60) had already been awarded and that what was re-advertised were only twenty three (23) which were unsuccessful.






20.
They asserted that the Petitioner had sought orders to punish its own members as some of them had been awarded tenders. They added that although the orders that had been sought would negatively affect the contractors who were already doing the works, it had not made an effort to identify them and enjoin them to the Petition. They averred that the said members would suffer being punished unheard.






21.
They pointed out that the Petition was primarily about private pursuits and was not in the public interest to warrant conservatory orders and that the Petitioner had not made full disclosure of all the facts which they disclosed through their Replying Affidavit.






22.
In that regard, they placed reliance on the case of Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited vs Kitobu Limited [2019] eKLR where it was held that conservatory orders bore a more decided public law connotation to facilitate ordered functioning within public agencies as well as to uphold the adjudicatory authority of the court, a position the Supreme Court articulated well in the case of Gatarau Peter Munya vs Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others [2014] eKLR.






23.
In its Ruling of 24
th
 September 2024, this court dismissed the Respondents’ Notice of Preliminary Objection dated and filed on 6
th
 February 2024 and found that it had the jurisdiction to hear the Petition herein. The question herein was whether or not the Petitioner had demonstrated that it would be in the interest of justice to grant conservatory orders as this court heard and determined the Petition herein.






24.
At this interlocutory stage, the court had to navigate a thin line by avoiding to delve onto the merits of the Petition before hearing the parties but at the same time ascertaining whether a prima facie case had been made out to warrant issuance of conservatory orders. The question of maintaining this balance was addressed in the case of Muslim for Human Rights (Milimani) & 2 Others vs Attorney General & 2 others [2011] eKLR.






25.
Notably, a conservatory order was a remedy that was issued to preserve a subject matter until a suit and/or petition was heard and determined. It was an order of status quo ante meant to preserve the substratum of the suit so as to not render the substantive matter an academic exercise.






26.
The nature and the principles guiding the grant of conservatory orders were now well settled. In the case of Gatarau Peter Munya vs Dickson Mwenda Kithinji & 2 others (Supra), the Supreme Court held that conservatory orders “…should be granted on the merit of a case and bearing in mind the public interest, the constitutional values, the proportionate magnitudes and priority levels attributable to the relevant courses.”






27.
It further held that conservatory orders could only be granted if it was shown that it was in public interest that the conservatory orders be granted.






28.
From the facts that had been presented before this court, it did appear to this court that a substantial number of the bids were successful, already awarded and works commenced. Indeed, the Petitioner did not rebut this averment. Neither the Petitioner nor the Respondents informed this court of the fate of the bids that were advertised on 12
th
 January 2024.






29.
As this court was unable to ascertain the status of the re-advertised bids, it found and held that the Petitioner had not established a prima facie case to persuade this court to grant conservatory orders herein. As several entities and/or persons were not parties to the suit herein and they would be affected by any orders issued herein, the balance of convenience tilted in favour of not granting conservatory orders at this interlocutory stage.








Disposition


30.
For the foregoing reasons, the upshot of this court’s decision was that the Petitioner’s Notice of Motion application dated 14
th
 February 2024 and filed on 15
th
 February 2024 was not merited and the same be and is hereby dismissed.






31.
As this was a public interest litigation and it would be unconscionable to award costs to a government against its citizen, this court hereby directs that each party will bear is own costs of this application.






32.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
Before the Court for determination is the Respondent/Applicant’s Chamber Summons dated 6
th
 March, 2024 filed on 20
th
 March, 2024 seeking orders that:
1.
The Honourable Court be pleased to extend time to file the instant application for reference.
2.
The decision of the Taxing Master delivered on 30
th
 November, 2023 finding that there was no proof of settlement of agreed costs and awarding the sum of Kshs.300,000/= be set aside and/or vacated.
3.
The Bill of Costs dated 20
th
 September, 2022 be struck out.
4.
The cost of this application be provided for.






2.
The Chamber Summons is based on the grounds set forth on its face and the Supporting Affidavit sworn by Kevin Wakwaya Advocate on 6
th
 March, 2024 who deposes that the Bill of Costs dated 30
th
 September, 2022 was taxed on 30
th
 November, 2023.






3.
The affiant deposes that the Taxing Master having found that the parties had an agreement on costs and evidence to that effect availed, the matter was deemed settled.






4.
That a letter dated 29
th
 November, 2023 requesting for the Ruling was unresponded to as was the reminder dated 11
th
 January, 2024 and the Respondent only realized that the Court had granted costs of Kshs.300,000/= on 22
nd
 February, 2024, on the ground of want of evidence of payment of the sum of Kshs.300,000/=.






5.
The affiant deposes that allowing execution to proceed is tantamount to having the Claimant paid costs twice and exposes the Respondent to double jeopardy on costs as the Claimant admitted having received Kshs.300,000/= as costs.






6.
That the reference ought to have been filed by 14
th
 December, 2023 but was not until 6
th
 March, 2024 and the delay is not inordinate to disentitle the Respondent/Applicant extension of time to lodge the instant reference.






7.
Counsel deposes that time starts running when the aggrieved party receives the ruling of the Taxing Master as the decision on the way forward cannot be made hitherto and the Court has jurisdiction to extend time under Rule 11(2) of the Advocates Remuneration Order and ought to do so in the interest of justice.






8.
That based on the evidence of payment of the agreed costs, the Bill of Costs should have been struck out as opposed to being taxed at Kshs.300,000/= and the Taxing Master fell into error in arriving at the decision in the face of evidence of payment of the agreed costs which should be corrected.






9.
That it is in the interest of justice that the application be allowed.






Response


10.
When the matter came up for hearing of the Respondent’s Chamber Summons, on 18
th
 April, 2024, counsel for the Applicant informed the Court that whereas service had been effected, no response had been received and prayed that the Chamber Summons be allowed.






11.
Counsel for the Respondent informed the Court that the application had not been served and pray for 14 days to respond.






12.
Counsel for the Applicant on the other hand displayed an affidavit of service but agreed that the Respondent be accorded time to respond to the application.






13.
The Court directed the Applicant to re-serve the Chamber Summons by close of business, Respondent had 14 days to file a response and both parties were given 14 days to file and exchange submissions and a mention was slated for 4
th
 July, 2024 to confirm compliance, but took place on 20
th
 July, 2024 when counsel for the Respondent reported that the counter-part had reached out to settle the matter out of Court and requested for 7 days.






14.
Counsel for the Respondent reported that the application had not been served and no response had been filed and was unaware of the attempts to settle the matter out of court.






15.
Mr. Wakwaya for the Applicant informed the Court that Mr. Nyangito had reached out to him to compromise the application but could progress the application by filing of submissions and confirm the same in new term.






16.
The Court directed parties to file 2 page submissions within 14 days and the applicant re-service by close of business and a mention slated for on 26
th
 September, 2024 to confirm compliance.






17.
By 7
th
 September, 2024 when the Court retired to write this ruling, none of the parties had filed submissions and the Respondent had not yet filed a Replying Affidavit.








Analysis


18.
Briefly, by a judgment delivered on 1
st
 March, 2019, the Court awarded the sum of Kshs.1,357,044.00 being 3 months’ salary compensation and costs to the Claimant and the decretal sum was to attract interest at court rates from date of judgment till payment in full.






19.
Documents on record reveal that the Respondent’s counsel filed the Party and Party Bill of Costs dated 7
th
 March, 2022 of Kshs.302,269.91.






20.
Counsel for the Applicant deposes that the same was unmerited as the costs of the suit had been agreed upon and paid as the sum awarded was Kshs.1,357,044.00 less PAYE and other statutory deductions of Kshs.407,113.20/= Kshs.949,930.8 but as agreed, the Applicant paid Kshs.300,000/= as costs making a total of Kshs.1,249,930.80 paid on 29
th
 March, 2019.






21.
The Applicant contested the Bill of Costs variously.






22.
After hearing both sides, the learned Taxing Master awarded the sum of Kshs.300,000/= on the premise that although the parties had agreed, there was no evidence of payment of the sum.






23.
This is the Ruling that Applicant seeks to challenge by way of reference and seeks the Court’s leave to extend time to enable it do so.






24.
As held by Ringera J. in Donholm Rahisi Stores (firm) V E.A. Portland Cement Ltd (2005) eKLR;
“
Taxation of costs whether those costs be between party and party or between advocate and client is a special jurisdiction reserved to the Taxing Officer by the Advocates Remuneration Order. The Court will not be drawn into the arena of taxation except by way of reference (from a decision on taxation) made under Rule 11 of the Advocates Remuneration Order.”






25.
See also Machira and Company Advocates V Magugu (2002) 2 E.A 248.






26.
Rule 10 of the Remuneration Order identifies the person(s) who may serve as Taxing Officers.






27.
Rule 11 of the Advocates Remuneration Order provides;
1.
Should any party object to the decision of the Taxing Officer, he may within fourteen days after the decision give notice in writing to the Taxing Officer of the items of taxation to which he objects.
2.
The Taxing Officer shall forthwith record and forward to the objector the reasons for his decision on those items and the objector may within fourteen days from the receipt of the reasons apply to a judge by chamber summons, which shall be served on all the parties concerned, setting out the grounds of his objection.






28.
Judicial authority is consistent that failure by the Taxing Officer to provide reasons is not fatal to the application reference as they are typically contained in the ruling itself. See Ahmed Nassir V National Bank of Kenya (2006) EA and Bernard Gichohi Njira V Kanini Njira Kathendu & another (2015) eKLR among others.






29.
It is common ground that the Ruling the Applicant seeks to challenge was delivered on 30
th
 November, 2023 and both parties were represented in Court by Mr. Okumu holding brief for Mr. Nyangito and Miss Masara holding brief for Mr. Wakwaya for the Respondent/Applicant.






30.
Evidently, the Applicant did not invoke Rule 11(1) of the Advocates Remuneration Order which demands action within 14 days after the decision is rendered by 14
th
 December, 2023.






31.
Uncontroverted evidence of the Applicant is that by letter erroneously dated 29
th
 November, 2023 and another dated 11
th
 January, 2024, it requested for a copy of the Ruling delivered on 30
th
 November, 2023 but none was responded to and it was not until 22
nd
 February, 2024, that the Applicant laid its hands on the ruling and filed the instant application outside the 14 days under Rule 11(2) of the Advocates Remuneration Order.






32.
Documents on record reveal that the Respondent’s counsel initiated the discussion on the amount of costs payable by suggesting Kshs.350,000.00 but the Applicant’s counsel did not respond in writing or vide email but the sum of Kshs.1,249,930.80 was paid on 29
th
 March, 2024, which according to the Applicant included Kshs.300,000/= as costs.






33.
The Respondent/Applicant’s argument that the sum of Kshs.1,249,930.80 included costs but which the Respondent contested on the ground that the Court did not order that the sum of Kshs.1,357,044.00 be taxed is fortified by the Section 49(2) of the 
Employment Act
 that;
Any payments made by the employer under this section shall be subject to statutory deductions.






34.
Although the Applicant did not provide evidence of having paid for a copy of the ruling requested from the Deputy Registrar and appear to have given up after the second letter dated 11
th
 January, 2024 coupled with the Respondent’s proposal on costs, the letters are self-explanatory that efforts were expended to obtain a copy of the Ruling but to no avail.






35.
More significantly, Rule 11(2) of the Advocates Remuneration Order uses the term “may” as opposed to “shall” with reference to the duration within which the reference must be filed from the date of receipt of the reasons.






36.
Granted that the Applicant received the Ruling on 22
nd
 February, 2024 and filed the instant application in March 2024, the delay, in the Court’s view, is not inordinate.






37.
For the foregoing reasons, and coupled with the reality that the Chamber Summons is unopposed and the fact that the parties have been negotiating, the Court is persuaded that the interests of justice will be better served if the parties are accorded an opportunity to ventilate their respective cases in the reference and a determination made.






38.
Consequently, the Applicant’s Chamber Summons dated 6
th
 March, 2024 is granted in terms of Prayer No. 1 to enable the Applicant file and serve the Reference application.






39.
For the avoidance of doubt, all other Orders sought are struck out.






40.
Parties shall bear their own costs.

Ruling








(On motion dated 6/2/2024)


1.
On 13
th
 July 2023, Hon. Asenath Ongeri J issued conservatory orders directing that the status quo of the leadership of the Jubilee Party be maintained as outlined in Gazette Notice No. 3195 of 22
nd
 March 2022, and staying the Gazette Notice No. 9131 of 2023, published in the Special Issue Vol. CXXV-161 on 12
th
 July 2023, and any related instructions decisions or actions, pending the hearing and determination of the application dated 12
th
 July 2023.






2.
Before the court now is the 1
st
 to 3
rd
 Appellant/ Applicants Notice of Motion dated 6
th
 February 2024 seeking to have Hon. Sabina Chege, the alleged Contemnor, cited for contempt of this court’s orders of 13
th
 July 2023 and committed to civil jail for a period of six (6) months. The Applicants further pray that the alleged Contemnor be directed to purge the offending communication failing which the Court should expunge all documents filed on her behalf in these proceedings. Additionally, the Applicants for such other or further appropriate reliefs as the court may deem fit and costs of the application.






3.
The application is brought under Articles Sections 1A, 1B, 3A & 63(e) of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, Section 5 of the 
Judicature Act
, Cap 8 Laws of Kenya. It is based on the grounds on the face of the motion and supported by the Affidavit of the 1
st
 Applicant Jeremiah Kioni, and the annextures thereto. The Applicants assert that pursuant to the conservatory orders of 13
th
 July 2023, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta remains the Jubilee party leader, while the 1
st
 Applicant is the bona fide Secretary General and official spokesperson of the Jubilee Party, with both continuing to exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Party's Constitution.






4.
The Applicants further state that all the parties herein including the Contemnor who is a member of the Jubilee Party have been served with and are fully aware of the conservatory orders, which remain in force. However, the Applicants allege that in blatant defiance of these orders the Contemnor has been unlawfully presenting herself as the 'acting party leader' and spokesperson by holding press conferences and meetings in her assumed capacity. Additionally, the Applicants claim that despite demands to purge her contempt, she has openly vowed in a letter dated 30
th
 January 2024 to continue her defiance.






5.
The Applicants also assert that similar acts of contempt are already the subject of pending contempt proceedings instituted through their applications dated 2
nd
 October 2023 and 21
st
 November 2023. They further argue that if the contempt is not swiftly addressed and purged, it will cause irreparable harm to the administration of justice and render the appeal nugatory.






6.
In opposition, Hon. Sabina  Chege, the alleged contemnor, filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on 27
th
 February 2024 asserting that she serves as the current Minority Whip of Jubilee Party in the National Assembly. She contends that she was not personally served with the said application contrary to the Court's orders for personal service. Further she denies disobeying the court orders stating that the orders were not directed at her as she is not a party to these proceedings. Additionally, she argues that the conservatory orders issued by Hon. Ongeri J are ambiguous and contain irregularities, illegalities and general misunderstanding of various legal provisions.






7.
Hon Chege in her replying affidavit further  explains that after the 2022 general elections, President William Ruto assumed office and by law, the retired President Uhuru Kenyatta ceased to hold any political party office as of 13
th
 March 2023. Therefore, compliance with the court order directing that the Jubilee Party leadership be maintained as per the Gazette Notice of 22
nd
 March 2022 is, in her view, impossible.






8.
Additionally, the alleged contemnor denies assuming the substantive leadership of the Jubilee Party in defiance of the court order and asserts that the party had been without a leader from 13
th
 March 2023 until 22
nd
 May 2022 when she was appointed as the Acting Party Leader by the National Executive Committee of the Jubilee Party pending the election for a substantive leader as well as  Jubilee Party Whip in Parliament thereby making her the leader of the duly elected Jubilee Party Members of Parliament. Further, she accuses the Applicants of delaying the hearing of the substantive application and the appeal to the detriment of the legitimate members of the Jubilee Party, which requires a leader to function effectively. Finally she contends that she cannot be held responsible for the Applicants’ misinterpretation of her statements or for what the media publishes as news stories.






9.
The court has carefully considered the application the Affidavits sworn in support and in opposition thereto as well as the parties’ respective written submissions from which the only issue for determination is whether she is in contempt  of court orders issued by on 13
th
 July 2023.






10.
Contempt of court is conduct or action that defies or disrespects authority of court. Black’s Law Dictionary 9
th
 Edition, defines contempt as:
“
The act or state of despising; the conduct of being despised. Conduct that defies the authority or dignity of a court or legislature. Because such conduct interferes with the administration of justice.”






11.
Section 5 (1) of the 
Judicature Act
 Cap 8 Laws of Kenya confers on this court the jurisdiction to punish for contempt in the following terms: -
1.
The High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have the same power to punish for contempt of court as is for the time being possessed by the High Court of Justice in England, and that power shall extend to upholding the authority and dignity of subordinate courts.”






12.
Courts punish for contempt to uphold the dignity and authority of the court, ensure compliance with directions of the court, observance and respect of due process of law, preserve an effective and impartial system of justice, and maintain public confidence in the administration of justice by courts: See Sheila Cassatt Issenberg & another v Antony Machatha Kinyanjui [2021] eKLR. Additionally, in the case of Samuel M. N. Mweru & Others v National Land Commission & 2 others [2020] eKLR cited by the 3
rd
 Respondent herein, Mativo J. pronounced himself as follows:
“
46. Contempt of court is not merely a mechanism for the enforcement of court orders. The jurisdiction of the superior courts to commit recalcitrant litigants for contempt of court when they fail or refuse to obey court orders has at its heart the very effectiveness and legitimacy of the judicial system. That, in turn, means that the court called upon to commit such a litigant for his or her contempt is not only dealing with the individual interest of the frustrated successful litigant but also, as importantly, acting as guardian of the public interest. 
[49]
”






13.
In the case of Samuel M. N. Mweru Case (Supra), Mativo J. set down the test for contempt as follows:
“
40. It is an established principle of law that 
[45]
 in order to succeed in civil contempt proceedings, the applicant has to prove (i) the terms of the order, (ii) Knowledge of these terms by the Respondent, (iii). Failure by the Respondent to comply with the terms of the order. Upon proof of these requirements the presence of willfulness and bad faith on the part of the Respondent would normally be inferred, but the Respondent could rebut this inference by contrary proof on a balance of probabilities. 
[46]
 Perhaps the most comprehensive of the elements of civil contempt was stated by the learned authors of the book Contempt in Modern New Zealand 
[47]
 who succinctly stated: -
“There are essentially four elements that must be proved to make the case for civil contempt. The applicant must prove to the required standard (in civil contempt cases which is higher than civil cases) that: -
a.
the terms of the order (or injunction or undertaking) were clear and unambiguous and were binding on the defendant;
b.
the defendant had knowledge of or proper notice of the terms of the order;
c.
the defendant has acted in breach of the terms of the order; and
d.
the defendant's conduct was deliberate.”






14.
Further, in the Sheila Cassatt Issenberg case (supra) the court cited with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of India in Mahinderjit Singh Bitta v Union of India & Others 1 A NO. 10 of 2010 (13
th
 October, 2011) where it was stated that:
“
In exercise of its contempt jurisdiction, the courts are primarily concerned with enquiring whether the contemnor is guilty of intentional and willful violation of the order of the court, even to constitute a civil contempt. Every party is lis before the court and even otherwise, is expected to obey the orders of the court in its spirit and substance. Every person is required to respect and obey the orders of the court with due dignity for the institution.” (Emphasis).






15.
In this case, it is evident that the alleged Contemnor is not a party to the appeal or the dispute between the parties herein. However, this does not preclude the court from holding her liable or punishing her for contempt if it is established that she wilfully and deliberately disobeyed a court order. In Halsbury’s laws of England at para 463 Vol 9(1) (Re-issue) 3, the authors stated thus: -
“
…a person not a party against whom any judgement or order may be enforced is liable to the same process for enforcing obedience to it as if he were a party”.






16.
Notably, given the serious consequences that flow from contempt proceedings such as fines or imprisonment, it is essential that the Court Order be properly served upon the alleged Contemnor and that it is established that she  has personal knowledge of its terms. The 1
st
 Applicant claims that all the parties herein including the alleged Contemnor were served with and are fully aware of the conservatory orders issued on 13
th
 July 2023. The alleged Contemnor disputes being personally served with the application and order.






17.
The court notes that the Applicants did not annex to their application any Affidavit of Service to substantiate their claim of service. Additionally they have not filed any Supplementary Affidavit to refute the alleged Contemnor’s assertions or provided evidence to show that she had actual knowledge of the Court Order, despite not being served, if at all, and what it required her to do or refrain from doing but wilfully disobeyed the court order. While Hon. Sabina Chege may be a member of the Jubilee Party, service of the court order upon the Party or its representatives does not automatically equate to personal service upon her given that a political party as a legal entity is distinct from its individual members.






18.
In the premises the court finds that the Applicants have not established or demonstrated that the alleged contemnor was personally served with the motion and the court order, or  had  knowledge of the court order to the requisite standard and thus there can be no contempt on her part.






19.
Moreover, a careful review of the court order of 13
th
 July 2023 reveals that it did not explicitly prohibit other individuals within the Jubilee Party’s leadership from performing functions aligned with their designated roles. The court orders primarily focused on preserving the existing leadership titles and designations for the period that it remains in effect. The alleged Contemnor has availed a decision made by the Speaker of the National Assembly on 25
th
 October 2023 appointing her as the Jubilee Party Whip in the National Assembly on an interim basis. This appointment has not been challenged set aside or stayed, and it was not within the scope of the court orders issued on 13
th
 July 2023.






20.
The court notes that the print media extracts submitted by the Applicants as exhibits do not contain any direct statements attributed to Hon. Sabina Chege on the alleged press conferences, nor were video recordings of any actions she may have taken in defiance of the court order provided to the court. The court upon perusal of some of the media reports notes that  some date back to 8
th
 February 2023 before the issuance of the court orders while others were published after Hon. Sabina Chege had already been appointed as the Party Whip. Without further corroborating evidence, the court cannot rely on mere news reports to conclude that Hon. Chege engaged in any contemptuous actions.






21.
Additionally, the Applicants have failed to demonstrate how Hon. Chege’s conduct interfered with the Jubilee Party’s leadership or undermined the authority of the 1
st
 Applicant as the Secretary General and official spokesperson of the Party.






22.
Upon reviewing the letter dated 30
th
 January 2024 from Hon. Chege’s advocates, the court notes that it simply communicated her intent to continue fulfilling her responsibilities as the elected Party Whip in Parliament. This role is distinct from the matters covered by the court orders of 13
th
 July 2023, and there is no indication that she claimed any authority beyond what was lawfully assigned to her.






23.
It is important to reiterate that contempt proceedings are quasi criminal in nature and require a high standard of proof due to the serious consequences involved. As the Applicants are the ones alleging contempt, the burden of proof lay on them to demonstrate that Hon. Sabina Chege violated the court orders of 13
th
 July 2023. However, the court finds that the Applicants have failed to discharge that burden.






24.
For the foregoing, the court finds no merit in the 1
st
 to 3
rd
 Appellants’ Notice of Motion dated 6
th
 February 2024. The same is dismissed with an order that each party bears their own costs as is very clear to the court that these proceedings arose from leadership wrangles within and by members of the Jubilee party.

Ruling










1.
In the Judgment delivered on 26
th
 July, 2023, the Court awarded the Claimants;
a.
Unpaid basic salary during interdiction,
b.
Equivalent of two (2) months gross salary and
c.
Costs of the Court.






2.
Owing to the absence of figures as to how much the Claimants were paid during interdiction, effective 20
th
 July, 2017, till their dismissal on 15
th
 December, 2017, the Court was unable to compute the actual figures payable to the Claimants and the Claimants did not do so until now.






3.
According to the Claimant’s counsel, the unpaid basic salary was as follows;
Joseph Sudi Ndinyo Kshs.47,537.50 per month
Kazungu Mwango Kshs.51,600.00 per month






4.
The two months gross salary awarded as compensation is relatively easy to compute as the Claimants salary for June 2017 was as follows;
Joseph Sudi Ndinyo Kshs.214,336.28
Kazungu Mwango Kshs.208,200.04
which translates to Kshs.428,672.56 and Kshs.416,400.08 respectively.






5.
Although the Claimants’ counsel used five (5) months as the duration the Claimants were on interdiction, the duration is slightly less as it is about 4 months and 25 days.
Joseph Sudi Ndinyo
47,537.50 x 4 = 190,150.00
25 days = 39,614.58
Total = 229,764.58
Kazungu Mwango
51,600 x 4 = 206,400.00
25 days = 43,000.00
Total = 249,400.00






6.
In the end, the Claimants dues are computed as follows;
Joseph Sudi Ndinyo Kshs.229,764.58
Two months’ salary Kshs.428,672.56
Total award Kshs.658,437.14
Kazungu Mwango Kshs.249,400.00
Two months’ salary Kshs.416,400.08
Total award Kshs.665,800.08

          (Being an appeal against the Ruling of CAS Mutai-SPM Bungoma dated and delivered on the 18th October 2022 in Bungoma Chief Magistrate’s Court Misc. Civil Application No. 587 of 2021)
        
      






Ruling










1.
This is an appeal by the Appellant brought by the way of Chamber Summons dated 28
th
 August 2023 filed on 5
th
 September, 2023, seeking to set aside the ruling and order of the Taxing Master delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 and the extracted certificate of costs dated 27
th
 October 2022. The Appellant as well prayed that this Court be pleased to refer the matter back to a different Taxing Master to dispense with the same and that the Appellant be granted costs of the application.






2.
The Chamber Summons was filed in accordance with Rule 55 (3) & (4) of the Auctioneers Rules 1997, Section 1A, 1B, 3A, 75, 79G and 95 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 CAP 21, Order 50 Rule 6 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 2010, and Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya.






3.
The appeal is supported by the grounds premised on the face of the Chamber Summons and the annexed affidavit of Daniel Ogola, Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant, wherein he deponed inter alia; that the Taxing Master erred in law and in fact when he proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 and awarding them a sum of Kshs. 343,509.00/= which was beyond the reasonable limits and manifestly excessive; that the Taxing Master proceeded to tax the 1
st
 Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 August 2022 without considering the items No. 4 and 6 ought to have been taxed off in their entirety vide the subject ruling in grounds that the said award was erroneously drawn, inordinately high, manifestly excessive and grossly inflated; that the Taxing Master misdirected himself and acted contrary to the established dints on taxation as set out in the case of Truth Justice & Reconciliation Commission vs Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya & Another (2014) eKLR.






4.
Opposing the reference, the 1
st
 Respondent swore a Replying Affidavit on 28
th
 June 2024 vide Dickson Omonde, wherein he averred inter alia: that the contents of the Appellant’s Chamber Summons and Supporting Affidavit dated 28
th
 August 2023 and filed on 5
th
 September, 2023 do not dispute that the 1
st
 Respondent was instructed by the Appellant to recover money from its several defaulters and that instructions letters were duly issued as per annexure marked D.O.2; that the Appellant failed to settle the fees arising from the repossession exercise prompting the 1
st
 Respondent to move to Court pursuant to Rule 55(3) of the Auctioneers Rules to have the Taxing Master determine what was due to it; that the reference before this Court is an afterthought and that the Appellant has failed to point out the errors in principal; that the Appellant’s refence fails to appreciate the fact that the Auctioneers fees is charged based on the value of the property under attachment thus its assertions lack legal foundation and justification.






5.
Vide directions issued on 5
th
 February 2024, parties were ordered to canvass this appeal by way of written submissions. Upon perusal of the Court record, only the 1
st
 Respondent complied with this directive.






6.
I have duly considered the appeal before me. A synopsis of that rule shows that the fees payable to an auctioneer for the attachment, repossession and sale of movable and immovable property shall be charged in accordance with the Auctioneers Rules, 1997. Rule 55 of the Auctioneer’s Rules provides as follows:
“
55 (2)
where a dispute arises as to the amount of fees payable to an auctioneer –
a.
in proceedings before the High Court; or
b.
where the value of the property attached or repossessed would bring any proceedings in connection with it within the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, a registrar, as defined in the Civil Procedure Rules (Cap 21, Sub Leg), may on the Application of any party to the dispute assess the fee payable
4.
An appeal from a decision of a registrar or a magistrate or Board under sub rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers.
5.
The memorandum of appeal, by way of chamber summons setting out the grounds of the appeal, shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate”






7.
It is clear from the above provision and in particular Rule 55(5) that an appeal from a decision of a Registrar or a Magistrate or the Board under sub-rules (2) and (3) shall be to a judge in chambers and that the Memorandum of Appeal, by way of Chamber Summons setting the grounds of the appeal shall be filed within 7 days of the decision of the Registrar or Magistrate. This provision clearly prescribes the procedure to be followed where one challenges the decision of the Taxing Officer. That is, the only prescribed way is through a memorandum of appeal by way of Chambers Summons. This procedure was termed mandatory by the Court in Ezekiel Kiminza t/a Auto Land Auctioneers v Mistry Valji Naran Mulji [2017] eKLR.






8.
Subject to the Order of this Court issued on 5
th
 February 2024, the Appellant was granted leave to lodge its Reference against the Taxing Master’s decision out of time. This simply means that the appeal by way of Chamber Summons before this Court is properly filed rendering the same competent for this Court to deliberate on it.






9.
The only issue for determination is whether I should set aside the ruling delivered on 18
th
 October 2022 by the Taxing Master.






10.
On setting aside the Taxing Officer’s assessment, case-law is the first point of reference. It was held in the case of Oscar Otieno OdongoT/A Odongo Investment Auctioneers versus Sukari Industries Limited [2019] eKLR that the Taxing Officer’s assessment or taxation can only be interfered with when it is demonstratable that the decision was based on an error of principle or the fee awarded was manifestly high as to justify an interference.






11.
I have perused the availed grounds, Supporting Affidavit sworn by the Assistant Manager-Debt Recovery Unit of the Appellant and the ruling of the Taxing Master, the subject of this Reference. The core issue of the Appellant is the fact that the Taxing Master awarded the 1
st
 Respondent costs beyond reasonable limits thus manifestly excessive.






12.
Upon perusal of the Court record, it is noted that the Appellant herein vide a correspondence dated 7
th
 March 2018, issued instructions to the 1
st
 Respondent for repossession of motor vehicle registration No. KBN 659W to recover a loan balance of Kshs. 670,012.67/=. The enclosed letter of instruction was duly completed and executed. The 1
st
 Respondent was instructed to expeditiously effect the instruction and deliver the repossessed motor vehicle to Tango Storage Yard. The same is marked as marked D.O.2. Subsequently, the Appellant agreed to pay the 1
st
 Respondent’s charges as per fees agreed/as specified in the Auctioneers Rules.






13.
At this juncture, it is essential to note that only a licensed auctioneer can be used to recover outstanding debt. Failure to do so, the debtor shall have valid grounds to pursue a Court action against the secured creditor for wrongful disposal of the security property, as the conduct of seizure and sale of security assets falls under auctioneers’ business as stipulated under the 
Auctioneers Act
 of Kenya and it is unlawful for a person other than a licensed auctioneer to engage in auctioneering business.






14.
The 
Auctioneers Act
 was enacted to, “consolidate and amend the law relating to auctioneers, to provide for licensing and regulation of the business and practice of auctioneers, and for connected purposes.” Under Section 2(1) of the Act, “an auctioneer” means a person licensed under Section 10”. Section 10 of the Act provides for who may be eligible for a licence while Section 12 provides for the manner of application for a licence to the Auctioneers Licensing Board (“the Board”) established under section 3 of the Act. The Board’s functions include licensing and regulating the business and practice of auctioneers and supervision and discipline of auctioneers.






15.
The nature of the business of an auctioneer is set out in Section 2(3) of the 
Auctioneers Act
 which deems any person who does the following to be an auctioneer:
a.
attaches for sale any movable or immovable property in execution of a Court order made pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract;
b.
sells or offers for sale any movable or immovable property or any interest therein by auction or by any other mode of sale by competition;
c.
levies distress for rent or distrains under the provisions of any written law;
d.
carries out evictions under an order of a Court;
e.
repossesses goods from any person pursuant to the provisions of any written law or contract.






16.
From my perusal of the Court record, it is evident that the 1
st
 Respondent herein was a licensed auctioneer but it is imperative to also note that a secured creditor can hire a licensed auctioneer who practices in his own name or in a firm of auctioneers and provides services to secured creditors. Once the secured creditor has settled on hiring a particular auctioneer, the secured creditor shall issue a letter of instruction to the auctioneer in the statutory form under the 
Auctioneers Act
.






17.
Therefore, in drawing a bill of costs, the auctioneer is confined to only what is provided for in the Auctioneers Rules. The actual fees due to an auctioneer are provided for in Part II of the Fourth Schedule. The impugned bill of costs was drawn as follows: -

18.
The manner in which an auctioneer’s charges are assessed was settled by the Court of Appeal in the case of National Industrial Credit Bank Limited v S. K. Ndegwa Auctioneer [2005] eKLR where the Court held: -
“
The respondent based his fees on the decretal sum and the Deputy Registrar assessed the fees on the basis of the decretal sum. The wording of paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule does not say that the percentages stated apply to the decretal amount. It would be unjust to base the fee on attachment on the decretal amount because in some cases, the value of the attached goods may be many times less than the decretal amount shown in the warrant of attachment and sale.
The values indicated in paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule on the basis of which the fees for attachment are assessed are no doubt obscure. Nevertheless, it is a canon of construction of statutes, that if possible a statute should be construed in a manner which makes it operative and that where a statutory has several meanings even though there is little to choose between them, the courts must decide what meaning the statute is to bear, rather than reject the provision as a nullity. (See Paragraph 582 Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 36, 3rd Edition).
The main object of paragraph 4 is clear. It is intended to provide values on the basis of which the auctioneers should be assessed. We think that it is reasonable that the auctioneer’s charges for attachment should be based on the value of the goods attached and not on the decretal sum. It is to be remembered that the auctioneer is to be remunerated for the actual work done and not on the basis of what he could have done had he attached goods equivalent in value to the decretal sum. This is the meaning we give to paragraph 4 of Part II of the Fourth Schedule in order to make it operative…..”






19.
That aside, just as the law relating to taxation, the segments of the bill of costs as pleaded must be assessed by the taxing master. The bill of costs is never read and granted as a whole without giving reasons for each of the items upon reliance of the 
Auctioneers Act
 and Rules. Clearly, in this case the Taxing Master never gave reasons for the decision of granting the application as prayed being the hallmark of good administration of justice. Indeed, to fail to give reasons in any ruling or judgment threatens or infringes the fundamentals requirement of fairness. I consider reasons as the link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker. As stated in the case of Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd (2000) 1 W.L.R. 337 at 381, Henry LJ stated that “The duty is a function of due process, and therefore justice.” Constitutional justice imposes a requirement of procedural fairness and consequentially this necessitates a duty to give reasons in the very essence of arbitrariness as one’s status could be redefined without adequate explanation as to why this was done. Secrecy creates suspicion, justly or unjustly. This secrecy may also be described as the hallmark of inefficient and corrupt administration. Reasons must therefore be disclosed. Besides, the giving of good reasons would inevitably earn respect for the decision maker. Further in R. v Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham (1991) 4 All E.R 310. “There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always or even usually give reasons for decision. The giving of reasons is necessary to ensure fairness.”






20.
In the matter before this Court, all the Appellant’s complaints and criticism of the Taxing Master is on what was done to the application on assessment of auctioneer’s bill of costs presented by the 1
st
 Respondent to warrant an award that is manifestly excessive. Under the sub-heading of the bill of costs, the catch word include assessment on the question referred to the Taxing Master. There may be a good reason for the Court to grant the application as prayed but to the aggrieved party who intends to appeal or review, is left in a precarious situation in absence of the reasons for the decision.






21.
More fundamental to this Court however, is the proposed quantum of Kshs. 290,509.03/= stated to have been incurred by the auctioneer. I am quite clear in my mind that the Taxing Master had a duty to give considerable thought on the evidence in support of taxing the bill of costs at Kshs.343,509.00/=. It is noteworthy that in the instant case there exists no means of ascertaining the rationality of the decision in absence of the reasons the taxing master used to arrive at a conclusion that the bill of costs should be granted as drawn. That decision on costs was so important to the Appellant because it deals with a substantial money decree capable of being enforced and executed as a judgment of the Court. It is therefore well entrenched that any decision by a judicial officer must be such that it enables both the winner and the aggrieved party to understand the reasons for the decision in sufficient details. It was therefore quite erroneous for the Taxing Master to fail to give reasons for his decision. It was strange for the Taxing Master to just order that the bill is assessed at Kshs. 343,509.00/=. The Taxing Master ought to have gone item by item so as to give credence to his determination. Clearly, the decision by the Taxing Master was arrived at in error and must be interfered with.






22.
The sum total of the foregoing observations is that the ruling of the learned Taxing Master cannot be sustained in law. The result is that the Appellant’s appeal is allowed. As far as the bill of costs is concerned, it is only fair that it be remitted to another Taxing Master for assessment and determination. The costs of the appeal are awarded to the Appellant.




It so ordered.

Ruling










1.
The objector filed a Notice of Motion application dated 15
th
 November, 2023 pursuant to the provisions of Order 22 Rules 51, 52 & 53 and Order 51 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010, Sections 1A, 1B & 3A of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, and all other enabling provisions of the law. The applicant seeks orders for this to vacate the proclamation and/or attachment of the objector’s movable assets/goods enlisted in the proclamation Notice dated 14
th
 November, 2023, that this Court permanently restrains the decree holder acting through its agents Tranzo Auctioneers or any other Auctioneers from proclaiming, attaching, and/or selling the objector’s properties, and that this Court sets aside the warrants of attachment of movable property dated 10
th
 November, 2023 and the Proclamation Notice dated 14
th
 November, 2023 for listing goods that do not belong to the judgment debtor.






2.
The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 15
th
 November, 2023 day by Sarah Nyamache, the objector’s Finance and Administration Manager who averred that the objector entered into a Master Rental Agreement with the judgment debtor, allowing the judgment debtor to lease equipment or machinery by executing Rental Schedules. She contended that the movable property in question belongs to the objector and is only held by the judgment debtor under rental terms. She indicated that she is aware that the decree holder through Tranzo Auctioneers, issued a Proclamation Notice dated 14
th
 November, 2023, against the objector's movable assets in the judgment debtor's possession, purporting to execute warrants of attachment and sale from a decree issued in this suit against the judgment debtor on 7
th
 November, 2023.






3.
She averred that warrants of attachment and sale of movable properties dated 10
th
 November, 2023 were issued to the judgment debtor by the decree holder. She argued that with the objector being the sole and exclusive owner of the proclaimed movable goods, the proclamation of these goods is unlawful. Ms. Nyamache emphasized that the objector is not a party to the suit and/or dispute between the decree holder and the judgment debtor, thus it is a stranger to the proceedings and the resultant judgment and decree issued against the judgment debtor in this suit.






4.
In opposition thereto, the decree holder filed a replying affidavit sworn on 16
th
 January, 2024 by Titus Mwaniki Kithana, a Director of the decree holder. He averred that the objector has not provided proof of ownership of the goods listed in the Proclamation Notice dated 10
th
 November, 2023. He noted that the assets mentioned in the said Notice differ from those claimed to be rented by the objector to the judgment debtor under the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012. He stated that according to the rental schedules, the equipment rented by the objector to the judgment debtor include Data Centre Hardware, IPCCTV Cameras, Access Control Equipment, Alarm System Equipment, Audio Visual Equipment, Electrical Equipment, Data Centre Electrical Equipment, Fire Detection Equipment, Fire Suppression Equipment, Electrical Equipment for Floors, Furniture, Kitchen Equipment, and various IT and network-related equipment.






5.
Mr. Mwaniki argued that the proclaimed goods which include wooden tables, glass tables, wooden wall cabinets, executive office leather sofa sets, executive office chairs, several office ordinary chairs, several high chairs, several wooden cabinets, several high stools, reception desk and chairs, computer desks, television sets, complete office computers, and several coffee makers, do not match the items listed in the Rental Schedules provided by the objector. He noted that the objector has not provided evidence that the furniture or electronics in question were part of the Rental Agreement and/or that they belong to the objector.






6.
He contended that all Rental Schedules had expired by 4
th
 July, 2019, and no evidence of an extension beyond that date has been provided. He argued that even if there was an automatic extension, the judgment debtor should have returned the equipment by 4
th
 July, 2020, well before the goods were proclaimed, but the objector has not shown that the equipment leased was not returned. Mr. Mwaniki asserted that the objector's claim of ownership is an attempt to scuttle the decree holder’s efforts to realize the fruits of its judgment.






7.
In a rejoinder, the objector filed a supplementary affidavit sworn on 22
nd
 February, 2024 by Sarah Nyamache. She claimed that the equipment listed in the Proclamation Notice dated 10
th
 November, 2023 fall under furniture, kitchen equipment, audio visual equipment, and internal IT equipment as indicated in Rental Schedules Nos. 01063SEV0002, 01063SEV0003 & 01063SEV0006. She averred that the contract terms between the objector and the judgment debtor had been subsequently renewed by the judgment debtor by retaining possession of the said equipment since the elapse of the term to date, as per the provisions of Clause 17 of the Master Rental Agreement. She argued that since the Rental Schedules and the Master Rental Agreement do not confer ownership rights of the leased goods to the judgment debtor, the objector remains the sole and exclusive owner of the attached goods.






8.
The application herein was canvassed by way of written submissions. The objector’s submissions were filed on 23
rd
 February, 2024 by the law firm of Nyaanga & Mugisha Advocates, whereas the decree holder’s submissions were filed by the law firm of Wanjohi Muli & Partners Advocates LLP on 14
th
 March, 2024.






9.
Ms. Kale, learned Counsel for the objector cited the provisions of Order 22 Rules 51(1) & (2) and Order 53 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 and the case of Arun C. Sharma v Ashana Raikundalia T/A A. Raikundalia & Co Advocates & 4 others [2014] eKLR. She submitted that the burden of proof lies on the objector to prove that it has legal or equitable interest in whole or part of the attached movable goods. She submitted that the standard of proof in objection proceedings is on a balance of probabilities, and in this case, the objector has demonstrated that it leased equipment to the judgment debtor pursuant to a Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and the subsequent Rental Schedules. She asserted that all the equipment listed in the Proclamation Notice dated 10
th
 November, 2023 being furniture, kitchen equipment, audio visual equipment, and internal IT equipment were leased to the judgment debtor by the objector.






10.
Counsel referred to Clause 13 of the Master Rental Agreement and stated that it requires the judgment debtor to return the equipment upon expiry or termination of the said Agreement, thus the Master Rental Agreement and the subsequent Rental Schedules did not confer ownership rights over the leased goods to the judgment debtor. She relied on the case of Patrick Kingori Warungogo v James Nderitu & another [2014] eKLR, and argued that since the objector has established that it owns the attached goods, the burden of proof shifts to the decree holder to demonstrate that the attached goods belong to the judgment debtor, which burden the decree holder had not discharged. She contended that the decree holder has no authority to proclaim, attach and sell the movable assets in question.






11.
Ms. Kale cited the case of Kenya Power & Lighting Company Limited v Sheriff Molana Habib [2018] , and urged this Court to issue the decree holder and/or its agent with a permanent injunction restraining it from proclaiming, attaching, and disposing of the movable goods in question in light of the reasons given by the objector.






12.
Mr. Muli, learned Counsel for the decree holder relied on the decisions in Stephen Kiprotich Koech v Edwin K. Barchilei: Joel Sitienei (objector) [2019] eKLR and Precast Portal Structures v Kenya Pencil Company Limited & 2 others [1993] eKLR, and submitted that the burden of proving ownership in objection proceedings lies with the objector. He stated that in this case, the objector has not discharged this burden since the Master Rental Agreement cannot serve as prove of ownership for reasons that at the time of proclamation, it had already expired, and no proof of extension of the same beyond 4
th
 July, 2019 was tendered by the objector. Counsel referred to Clause 17 of the Master Rental Agreement and stated that upon expiry of the term, the rentee was supposed to return the equipment to the rentor or request under Clause 22 for an extension of the term, and in either case, Notice was required to be given at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiry of the term, but no such notice has been produced before this Court by the objector.






13.
Counsel further submitted that although the same clause provided that the rental term could be automatically extended for a further twelve (12) months where the rentee had not given the ninety (90) days’ Notice, the same would have taken the contract up to 4
th
 July, 2020. In the premise, Counsel argued that the proclamation herein was done three (3) years after expiry of the Master Rental Agreement and the subsequent Rental Schedules, as the proclamation in issue was done on 14
th
 November, 2023. In addition, Counsel contended that whereas Rental Schedule No. 01063SEV0003 referred to furniture as one of the items leased to the judgment debtor, the subsequent Rental Schedule No. 01063SEV0006 shows that furniture was not leased again to the judgment debtor upon expiry of Rental Schedule No. 01063SEV0003.






14.
Mr. Muli referred to the case of Paul M. Munyao & 2 others v Civicon Limited (Judgment Debtor); AEA Limited & another [2021] eKLR, and asserted that no hard evidence has been produced by the objector to prove ownership of any of the proclaimed goods. He stated that for the said reason, the objector had not discharged its burden of proof to warrant the evidential burden shifting to the decree holder to demonstrate that the proclaimed goods belong to the judgment debtor.




ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION.


15.
I have considered the application filed herein, the grounds on the face of it and the affidavits filed in support thereof. I have also considered the replying affidavit filed the decree holder and the written submissions by Counsel for the parties. The issue that arises for determination is whether the application herein is merited.




Whether the application herein is merited.


16.
Order 22 Rule 51(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 provides as follows -
Any person claiming to be entitled to or have a legal equitable interest in the whole or part of any property attached in execution of a decree may at any time prior to payment out of the proceeds of sale of such property give notice in writing to the court and to all parties to the decree holder of his objection to attachment of such property.






17.
In objection proceedings, the burden of proof lies with the objector to demonstrate the relevant facts supporting his/her/its objection. The objector must prove the disputed issues of fact for the Court to exercise its discretion in their favour. This was the Court’s holding in the oft cited case of Arun C. Sharma v Ashana Raikundalia T/A A. Raikundalia & Co Advocates & 4 others (supra) where it was held that -
“
The objector bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to or has legal or equitable interest on the whole or part of the attached property. The key words are, entitled or to have a legal or equitable interest in the whole or part of the property.”






18.
There are certain aspects that an objector is expected to prove and demonstrate in order to discharge its burden of proof. These aspects were considered by the Court in the case of Grace Wanjiru Mbugua v Philip Karumi Matu [2009] eKLR, as hereunder -
“
The burden is on the objector to prove and establish his right to have attached property released from attachment. On the evidential material before the court, a release from attachment may be made if the court is satisfied:


1.
That the property was not when attached held by the judgement debtor for himself or by some other person in trust for the judgement debtor; or






2.
That the objector holds that property on his own account. But where the court is satisfied that the property was, at the time of attachment, held by the judgement debtor, as his own and not on account of any other person, or that it was held by some other person in trust for the judgement debtor or that ownership has changed, whereby the judgement debtor has been divested of the property in order to evade execution, on the change is tainted with fraud, the court shall dismiss the objection.”








19.
The decree holder obtained warrants of attachment and sale of movable properties dated 10
th
 November, 2023. Subsequently, vide a Proclamation Notice dated 14
th
 November, 2023 it proclaimed through Tranzo Auctioneers assorted furniture and assorted electronics which were in the possession of the judgment debtor and which the decree holder believes belong to the judgment debtor. Thereafter, the objector filed the instant application challenging the proclamation and attachment of the said goods on grounds that it is the sole and exclusive owner of the proclaimed movable goods, thus the proclamation of the said goods is unlawful.






20.
The objector claimed to have leased the said goods to the judgment debtor pursuant to a Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and t Rental Schedules. It is contended that the said Agreement and subsequent Rental Schedules do not confer ownership rights of the goods to the judgment debtor, since the said judgment debtor was required to return the goods in question to the objector upon expiry and/or termination of the aforesaid Agreement and Rental Schedules. In a bid to prove ownership of the said goods, the objector produced a Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and the Rental Schedules.






21.
On perusal of the Rental Schedules, it is evident that in as much as they include items like furniture, kitchen items, audio visual equipment, and internal IT equipment, it is not specific on the items that were actually leased and delivered to the judgment debtor. It is therefore impossible to tell from a perusal of the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and the Rental Schedules, as compared to the items/goods captured on the Proclamation Notice, whether indeed the items proclaimed by the decree holder form part of the items and/or equipment leased to the judgment debtor by the objector. As stated before in this ruling, in objection proceedings, the objector bears the burden of proving ownership of the disputed items and/or goods. In the case of Paul M. Munyao & 2 others v Civicon Limited (Judgment Debtor); AEA Limited & another (supra) the Court held that -
“
An objector who commences objection proceedings will produce strong evidence of ownership of the subject goods to rebut the prima facie presumption of the ownership of the goods by the judgment debtor. It is therefore expected that an objector will produce title documents or evidence that go towards establishing the objector’s claim to ownership of the subject goods. The issue of title to the goods cannot be left to speculation. In my view therefore, it is only after such strong evidence has been produced by an objector that the evidentiary burden shifts to the decree holder to show otherwise.” (Emphasis added).






22.
I agree with the above holding, and in this instance, it is my finding that the evidence adduced by the objector as proof of ownership of the proclaimed and attached goods leaves a lot to be desired as it gives room for speculation, which is discouraged when it comes to objection proceedings. It is my finding that the objector ought to have produced more detailed documentation, in addition to the documents already produced, to clearly show precisely what and/or which items/goods were leased and/or delivered to the judgment debtor pursuant to the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and the Rental Schedules, in order to discharge its burden of proving ownership of the proclaimed goods.






23.
It is not disputed that the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and the Rental Schedules expired on 4
th
 July, 2019, but no evidence has been tendered by the objector of extension and/or renewal of the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012, and the Rental Schedules. The objector however referred to Clause 17 of the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012, and argued that the Agreement was renewed and/or extended by the judgment debtor by retaining possession of the said equipment after the lapse of the term, to date.






24.
I have perused Clause 17 of the Master Rental Agreement dated 5
th
 December, 2012 and I note that it provides for automatic extension of the Agreement for a further twelve (12) months in the absence of a ninety (90) days’ Notice in writing extending the term or varying the equipment rented, when the judgment debtor fails to return the leased equipment. If that then is the case, the Master Rental Agreement and the Rental Schedules expired on 4
th
 July, 2020, three (3) years before the decree holder proclaimed the judgment debtor’s goods.






25.
It is rather questionable that in as much as the objector claims that the Master Rental Agreement and Rental Schedules were renewed by virtue of the judgment debtor retaining the leased goods and/or equipment beyond 4
th
 July, 2019, no evidence such as payments made for the leased items, communication between the objector and the judgment debtor on the state of the equipment and acknowledging receipt of payment for the equipment, has been tendered by the objector, so as to give credence to the objector’s allegations of extension of the lease term.






26.
In view of the said position, this Court finds that the objector has not discharged its burden of proving ownership of the proclaimed goods and/or equipment, to warrant being granted the orders sought in the application herein. In the absence of proof of ownership, this Court finds that the objector does not stand to suffer any loss and/or damage if the instant application not allowed, and if the decree holder is allowed to proceed with the attachment and sale of the proclaimed goods in realization and enjoyment of the fruits of its judgment.






27.
In the end, I find that the objector has not established legal or equitable rights in the proclaimed goods to warrant being granted the orders sought herein.






28.
The upshot is that the application dated 15th November, 2023 is devoid of merits. It is hereby dismissed with costs to the decree holder.
It is so ordered.

Ruling










1.
Falling for determination in this ruling is the respondent’s preliminary objection dated 15/1/2024, through which the respondent objectS to this appeal and urges that it be struck out on the following verbatim grounds:
a.
The lower court matter, the subject of this appeal, was a mortgage/charge dispute as pleaded in the plaint dated 7th December, 2022 at Paragraphs 5, 6, 10, 11, 13 and 15 (found at page 3 - 6 of the Record of Appeal filed herein on 3rd May, 2023).
b.
The appeal herein also raises issues relating to a mortgage/charge dispute as indicated in ground No 4 of the memorandum of appeal filed herein and dated 7th March, 2023.
c.
This court lacks jurisdiction over mortgage/charge disputes.
d.
This appeal is thus bad in law, incompetent, a non-starter and an abuse of court process.






2.
The preliminary objection was canvassed through written submissions dated 11/9/2024, filed by M/s Wamiti Njagi & Associates. The two appellants did not file written submissions. They did not attend the hearing to respond to the preliminary objection. The e-portal reveals that on 9/8/2024, the respondent uploaded an affidavit of service dated 2/8/2024 indicating that on 30/7/2024, they served on the appellants’ advocates a hearing notice relating to the preliminary objection.






3.
The court has considered the preliminary objection and the written submissions tendered in support of the preliminary objection. The gist of the respondent’s preliminary objection is that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The respondent contends that the dispute in the suit giving rise to this appeal was a mortgage/charge dispute, adding that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.






4.
The respondent cited the Court of Appeal decision in Co-operative Bank of Kenya Limited v Patrick Kangethe Njuguna & 5 Others (2017)eKLR. They also relied on the Supreme Court of Kenya decision in Albert Chaurembo Mumbo & & Others v Maurice Munyao & 148 Others (2019) eKLR in which the Supreme Court of Kenya emphasized that a suit filed before a court that does not have jurisdiction cannot be transferred to another court.






5.
The court has considered the preliminary objection and the submissions tendered. The single issue to be determined in this ruling is whether this court is seized of jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.






6.
I have looked at the plaint dated 7/12/2022 which contained the appellants’ claim in the suit that gave rise to this appeal. The two appellants pleaded that they took a loan of Kshs 2,200,000 from the respondent and secured the loan through a charge against title number Muguga/Kanyariri/712. The appellants went to the trial court to injunct the respondent against exercising the chargee’s statutory power of sale.






7.
It is clear from the above pleadings that there was no contestation about the fact that the 1st appellant was the registered proprietor of the suit land. It is also clear that the dominant issue in the trial court was whether the respondent was entitled to enforce the charge by exercising the chargee’s statutory power of sale against the chargor.






8.
The Court of Appeal has been categorical that questions as to whether the chargees statutory power of sale has crystalized fall outside the jurisdiction of the Environment & Land Court. In Co-operative Bank of Kenya Limited v Patrick Kangethe Njuguna & 5 others [2017] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held that:
“
25.
The respective jurisdictions of the ELC and the High Court are well spelt out by our Constitution. With regard to the ELC, Article 162(2)& (3) of 
the Constitution
 requires inter alia, that;
“Parliament shall establish courts with the status of the High Court to hear and determine disputes relating to-
a.
…
b.
The environment and the use and occupation of, and title to, land. Emphasis added.”
36.
By definition, a charge is an interest in land securing the payment of money or money’s worth or the fulfillment of any condition (see Section 2 of the 
Land Act
). As such, it gives rise to a relationship where one person acquires rights over the land of another as security in exchange for money or money’s worth. The rights so acquired are limited to the realization of the security so advanced (see Section 80 of the 
Land Act
). The creation of that relationship therefore, has nothing to do with use of the land (as defined above). Indeed, that relationship is simply limited to ensuring that the chargee is assured of the repayment of the money he has advanced the chargor.
37.
Further, Section 2 aforesaid recognizes a charge as a disposition in land. A disposition is distinguishable from land use. While the former creates the relationship, the latter is the utilization of the natural resources found on, above or below the land. As seen before, land use connotes the alteration of the environmental conditions prevailing on the land and has nothing to do with dispositions of land. Saying that creation of an interest or disposition amounts to use of the land, is akin to saying that writing a will bequeathing land or the act of signing a tenancy agreement constitute land use. The mere acquisition or conferment of an interest in land does not amount to use of that land. Else we would neither speak of absentee landlords nor would principles like adverse possession ever arise. If a disposition were held to constitute land use ….
41.
Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the ELC to deal with disputes relating to contracts under Section 13 of the ELC Act ought to be understood within the context of the court’s jurisdiction to deal with disputes connected to ‘use’ of land as discussed herein above. Such contracts, in our view, ought to be incidental to the ‘use’ of land; they do not include mortgages, charges, collection of dues and rents which fall within the civil jurisdiction of the High Court.”






9.
For the above reasons, this court agrees with the respondent that the Environment and Land Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The result is that the preliminary objection dated 15/1/2024 is upheld. Consequently, the appeal is struck out. The appellant shall bear costs of the appeal.

Defence Case


13.
The accused in her sworn statement said that she was married to Joseph Kiptisia who was an army man and who died in 2014 and after his death she remained in her matrimonial home but she had conflict with her brother in law called Zakayo Kiptisia who stole her late husband’s documents when he died. She said the deceased was her neighbor and she had no issues with him. She said on the 23
rd
 February, 2021, her grandchildren had gone to play while her daughter Celestine Chemeli had gone to fetch water and no one else was at home; and her neighbors live a bit far.






14.
The accused further stated that at 4p.m, she was sleeping outside when she suddenly saw the deceased a distant neighbor standing in front of her. She said the deceased said “leo ni leo msema kesho ni uongo” meaning “today is today whoever says tomorrow is a lier” and she thought he had disagreed with somebody and he was informing her. She said that the deceased never used to go to her place before. She added that after the deceased uttering the words, he tried to cut her but she used her hand to shield herself and she sustained a cut on her left hand and bled. Then she moved close to the deceased and pushed him making him to fall down and the panga dropped out of his hand. She said she then took the panga and cut him though she cannot recall which part of the deceased’s body he cut as he was confused. She said while she the deceased bleeding profusely, she entered the house and took her late husband’s sword and went to the police station through the forest to avoid seeing people. She said while on the way, she met an old man one Isaiah who testified in court as PW 3. She confirmed that the sword she had is the one which was produced in court.






15.
The accused testified that Pw3 greeted her but she did not respond but he saw her with the sword. She confirmed that she went to Kipsaraman police station to report to police that someone attacked her using a panga and she had injured him. She added that she went to the police because she feared for her life. She denied that people were drinking alcohol in her house and added that if there were people in her house drinking, they would have killed her. She said that she is a church person and worships at New Apostolic Church.






16.
The accused further denied using the sword to cut the deceased but said she removed the sword and left. She confirmed that she used the deceased’s panga and denied that the sword had blood. She said she was informed while in the cells that her house had been burnt. She denied cutting someone’s ear and said she did not intend to kill the deceased but she was defending herself and did not know the deceased would die. She said if cutting the deceased was intentional, she would not have gone to the police station. She sought the court’s forgiveness for killing the deceased unintentionally.








Analysis And Determination


17.
Under Section 203 of the penal code the ingredients for the offence of murder are as follows: -
a.
The death of the deceased.
b.
That the accused committed the act or omission which caused the death of the deceased
c.
That in the causing death of the deceased the Accused had malice aforethought.






18.
The above elements for the offence of murder were listed in the case of Anthony Ndegwa Ngari vs Republic [2014] eKLR, as follows:-
i.
The death of the deceased occurred;
ii.
That the Accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased; and
iii.
That the Accused had malice aforethought.






19.
Similarly, in the case of Republic Versus Andrew Omwenga (2009) eKLR the court stated as follows:-
“
It is clear from this definition that for an Accused person to be convicted of murder, it must be proved that he caused the death of the deceased with malice aforethought by an unlawful act or omission - there are therefore three ingredients of murder which the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. They are: (a) The death of the deceased and the cause of the death, (b) That the Accused committed the unlawful act which caused the death of the deceased and (c) That the Accused had the malice aforethought"".






20.
It is trite law that the burden of proof in criminal cases rests on the prosecution and the burden never shifts. The Accused has no burden to prove her innocence. In the case of Joseph Kimani Njau V Republic [2014] eKLR the Court of Appeal stated as follows:-
“
In all criminal trials, both the actus reus and the mens rea are required for the offence charged; they must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The trial court is under a duty to ensure that before any conviction is entered, both the actus reus and mens rea have been proved to the required standard. In the instant case, the trial court erred in failing to evaluate the evidence on record and to determine if the specific mens rea required for murder had been proved by the prosecution”






21.
In view of the above, the prosecution had the burden of proving the three ingredients of murder beyond reasonable doubt and will analyze each as hereunder.






(a) The death of the deceased


22.
There is no doubt that the deceased herein died. The death was confirmed by Wangare Wambugu who performed postmortem on 2
nd
 March,2021 at Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary and concluded that the deceased died as a result of acute blood loss due to deep cut wounds on the neck due to sharp force trauma following assault.








(b) Whether unlawfully caused the death of the deceased


23.
PW3 was at the accused’s house at the time of the incident testified that he saw the accused go for a somali sword from her house and saw her cut the deceased on the neck and after he had fallen down, she continued cutting him severally. The accused did not deny cutting the deceased though she said she used deceased’s panga and she did not intend to kill him. Upon inflicting the said injuries on the deceased, the accused went to surrender herself to police. She took the somali sword to police. Analysis by the Government chemist confirmed that it was stained with deceased’s blood. From the foregoing, there is no doubt that the accused committed that unlawful act of inflicting injuries on the deceased which led to his death. The second ingredient for the offence of murder was therefore proved beyond reasonable doubt.








(c) That the Accused had malice aforethought.


24.
Section 206 of the Penal Code on Malice aforethought states that:
“
Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence proving any one or more of the following circumstances an intention to cause the death of or to do grievous arm to any person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not;
(b)
knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of or grievous harm to some person, whether that person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused;
(c)
an intent to commit a felony;
(d)
an intention by the act or omission to facilitate the flight or escape from custody of any person who has committed or attempted to commit a felony.""






25.
From evidence adduced, upon demand for debt owing from accused by the deceased, the accused went for a somali sword and cut the deceased severally inflicting serious injuries. She continued cutting him even after he had fallen down. There is no evidence of fight back by the deceased. Her repeated merciless act of assault clearly show she was the aggressor. There is no doubt that in her mind the accused knew that her acts of assault on the deceased would cause death and this in my view demonstrate intention to kill in the mind of the deceased. From the foregoing, I find that the 3 ingredients for the offence of murder contrary to section 204 as read with section 203 of the penal code and convict him accordingly.






26.
Final Order: -
i.
The Accused person is convicted for the offence of murder.
ii.
Right of appeal 14 days.

Ruling










1.
This Court [Eboso J] disposed this appeal through a ruling dated 25/10/2021 in the following verbatim terms:
“
I have considered the application. In the absence of any response and/or submissions or any other form of opposition to the application, the court does dismiss this appeal in terms of prayer 2 of the notice of motion dated 20/1/2021. The appellant shall bear costs of the appeal. For the avoidance of doubt, the court makes the following disposal orders:
a.
The appeal herein is dismissed.
b.
The appellant shall bear costs of the appeal.”






2.
Subsequent to that, the two parties to the appeal brought parallel bills of costs. Both parties invited the taxing officer of the court to tax their respective bills of costs. The appellant’s bill of costs was dated 30/11/2022 and was filed through M/s Kariithi Njagi & Co. Advocates. The respondent’s bill of costs was dated 24/6/2022.






3.
Ultimately, the taxing officer of this court rendered a ruling dated 24/5/2023 in which she found and held that costs of the appeal had been awarded to the respondent and therefore there was “no merit in the bill of costs dated 30th March 2022”. Consequently, the taxing officer struck out the appellant’s bill of costs dated 30/3/2022. In addition, the taxing officer taxed the respondent’s bill of costs at Kshs. 199,790/-.






4.
Aggrieved by the decision of the taxing officer, on 8/6/2023, the appellant lodged a notice of objection to the decision in the following verbatim terms:
“
The applicant, Lupe Contractors Co. Ltd, hereby gives notice of its objection to the ruling on taxation delivered herein on 24th May 2023, and it so objects the ruling on the following items:
Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 24th June 2022:
a.
Item 1 – Instruction fees.
b.
Item 2 – Getting up fees.
c.
Item 3 to 8 – Perusing application, drawing response and court attendance thereof.
d.
Items 10 -19 – Drawing, making copies and attendance of application thereof.
Applicant’s Bill of Costs dated 30th November 2022:
a.

Advocates For The Applicant.”






5.
Subsequent to that, the appellant filed a chamber summons [hereinafter referred to as “the reference”] dated 20/6/2023, inviting this court to: (i) set aside the impugned ruling of the taxing officer; (ii) re-tax the parallel bills of costs; (iii) in the alternative, refer the two parallel bills of costs to the taxing officer for re-taxation; and (iv) issue an order providing for costs of the reference. The said reference dated 20/6/2023 is the subject of this ruling.






6.
The reference was premised on the grounds set out in the chamber summons and in the supporting affidavit of Peter Mwangi dated 20/6/2023. It was canvassed through written submissions dated 17/5/2024. Counsel for the appellant identified the following as the three issues that fell for determination in the reference and submitted on them: (i) Whether the respondent is entitled to an award of costs of their unsuccessful application; (ii) Whether the respondent is entitled to costs of an application compromised by a consent order silent on costs; and (iii) Whether the respondent is entitled to getting up fees.






7.
On whether the respondent is entitled to an award of costs of their unsuccessful application, the appellant made reference to the application dated 1/3/2019 and submitted that the said application was found unmerited and was dismissed with costs to the appellant. The appellant contended that the respondent’s application having been dismissed with costs, it was an error for the taxing officer to subsequently award the respondent costs of the dismissed application.






8.
On whether the respondent was entitled to costs of an application that had been compromised by a consent order silent on costs, the appellant submitted that the application dated 19/11/2018 was compromised through a consent entered into on 19/12/2018, adding that the subsequent award of costs of the application to the respondent constituted a re-writing of the parties’ agreement by the court, a decision which violated the principle of privity of contract.






9.
On whether the respondent was entitled to getting up fees, the appellant referred the court to paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 of the Advocates (Remuneration) Order and submitted that getting up fees in an appeal is awarded through a certification by the Judge. The appellant argued that no certification had been issued by the Judge, hence there was no basis for the award of getting up fees in this appeal.






10.
In conclusion, the appellant urged the court thus:
“
Conclusion
The applicant has demonstrated why the respondent is not entitled to the sums awarded in the Ruling given on 24/5/2023. The award of the disputed sums have resulted in a great injustice to the applicant as the amounts are irregular, unlawful and unjustifiable. In order for the ends of justice to be met, we pray that the court finds in favour of the applicant by setting aside the decision of the taxing master and/or varying the said decision as urged in these submissions.”






11.
The respondent filed written submissions dated 2/7/2024 in which he identified and submitted on the following three issues: (i) Whether the notice of objection was filed procedurally; (ii) Whether the appellant is entitled to any award of costs; and (iii) getting up fees.






12.
The respondent cited paragraph 11 (1) and (4) of the Advocates (Remuneration) Order and submitted that the impugned ruling having been rendered on 24/5/2023 and the notice of objection having been filed on 8/6/2023, the said notice of objection was fatally defective because it was filed outside the prescribed limitation period of 14 days.






13.
On whether the appellant is entitled to any award of costs, the respondent cited Section 27 of the 
Civil Procedure Act
 and argued that the respondent having been awarded costs of the appeal, he was properly entitled to the award. The appellant added that the taxing officer properly taxed off costs of the application dated 19/11/2018.






14.
On getting up fees, the respondent cited paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 of the Advocates Remuneration Order and the decision in Charles Mwangi Muriu v Benjamin Makokha Nyongesa; Machakos ELC Appeal No. 11 of 2019 and submitted that the taxing officer “was correct in affirming that the court ought to look at the full picture as opposed to compartmentalizing the matter when awarding getting up fees.”






15.
The court has considered the reference and the parties’ rival submissions. The court has also considered the relevant legal frameworks and jurisprudence. In the notice of objection dated 7/6/2023, the appellant objected to a total of 18 items in the respondent’s bill of costs dated 24/6/2022. The appellant also expressed themselves as objecting to the taxing officer’s findings on a total of 14 items in the appellant’s parallel bill of costs. However, in their subsequent written submissions, the appellant did not say anything on the taxing officer’s finding(s) on their bill of costs. Secondly, they only submitted on the taxing officer’s award on three (3) items in the respondent’s bill of costs. On their part, the respondent raised the issue of competency of the reference, contending that the reference was fatally defective and terming it a non-starter on account of limitation period relating to the lodging and serving of the notice of objection.






16.
Taking into account the foregoing, the following are the four key issues that fall for determination in this ruling: (i) Whether the appellant’s reference is fatally defective on account of limitation period for lodging a notice of objection; (ii) Whether the respondent is entitled to an award of costs on the application dated 1/3/2019; (iii) Whether the respondent is entitled to an award of costs on the application dated 19/11/2018; and (iv) Whether the respondent is entitled to an award of getting up fees in this appeal. The court will deal with the four issues sequentially in the above order.






17.
Is the reference under consideration fatally defective on account of limitation period? A reference under paragraph 11 of the Advocates (Remuneration) Order is initiated by filing and serving a notice of objection setting out the grounds of objection and the contested items in the award/decision of the taxing officer. Paragraph 
11
 (1) prescribes a limitation period of 14 days within which the notice of objection is to be filed and served. The 14 days limitation period runs from the date when the impugned taxation decision is rendered.






18.
The impugned taxation decision was rendered on 24/5/2023. The 14 days limitation period was to be reckoned from 25/5/2023, meaning that 25/5/2023 was to be counted as the first day. The 14 days limitation period therefore lapsed on 7/6/2023. The notice of objection through which the appellant initiated this reference was filed on 8/6/2023. Clearly, the notice of objection was filed after expiry of the 14 days limitation period. There was no evidence of any time-enlarging order procured by the appellant prior to filing the notice of objection. Indeed, the appellant did not bother to respond to this critical issue that was raised by the respondent. For the above reason, the court agrees with the respondent that this reference was initiated outside the prescribed limitation period of 14 days. Consequently, the reference is fatally incompetent. Regrettably, this is a fatal jurisdictional defect.






19.
The result is that the reference under consideration stands to be struck out on the ground that it was initiated outside the prescribed limitation period of 14 days. It is so ordered.






20.
In line with the principle in Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] eKLR, the court will down its tools without venturing into the other issues in the reference because it does not have the proper platform on which to pronounce itself on the issues.






21.
In summary, the application dated 20/6/2023 [the reference] is struck out for having been initiated through a notice of objection that was filed outside the prescribed limitation period of 14 days. The appellant will bear costs of the application/reference.

Ruling










1.
This ruling emanates from the parties' differing opinions on adopting the Surveyor’s report concerning Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028, 1073 and 1105 (the suit property). On 15
th
 February 2024, the Court instructed the parties to submit written comments or observations on whether the Court should adopt the Land Registrar’s and Surveyor report.






2.
Before proceeding, let me provide some background information. The Plaintiffs initiated this suit by filing an Originating Summons dated 30
th
 April 2021. The Plaintiffs seek permanent injunction orders restraining the defendants, their employees, or assigns from encroaching, trespassing, committing acts of wastage, and interfering with the Plaintiffs’ use and occupation of the property in question. Additionally, the Plaintiffs seek orders declaring that the Plaintiffs’ adverse possession has extinguished the Defendant’s title to the property and that they be declared as the rightful owners of the property. The Plaintiff’s pray that the Defendants’ title be canceled and the Plaintiffs be registered as the official owners of the property. Lastly, the Plaintiff pray for an order for the Deputy Registrar and/or the executive officer of the court to execute the necessary documents to comply with the aforementioned orders.






3.
The Originating Summons was grounded on the attached joint Affidavit of Charity Wambara Ngirigaca and Anthony Muthike Ngirigaca, the 1
st
 and 5
th
 Plaintiffs, dated 30
th
 April, 2021. They averred that the 1
st
 Plaintiff and her late husband, Julius Ngirigaca Gaku, moved into the property in question over Twenty years ago where on they established their matrimonial home and raised all their children, the 2
nd
 to 5
th
 Plaintiffs. The deponents stated that once the 2
nd
 to 6
th
 Plaintiffs reached adulthood, they also made homes and raised their children on the suit property. The deponents further averred that the Defendants had never set foot on the property to claim ownership and that they themselves had been in continuous and, exclusive possession of the property for over twelve years.






4.
The 2
nd
 Defendant filed a Replying Affidavit in opposition stating that she was the registered proprietor of Baragw/Raimu/ 1028, 1073, and 1106. She stated that she had purchased the parcels from the Plaintiff's father, Julius Ngirigaca. She claimed to be a purchaser for value without notice and had obtained certificates of title to her parcels of land before the Plaintiffs’ father passed on. She further contended that the Plaintiffs could not claim adverse possession over her land, as she had been in possession of the land since purchasing the parcels of land in 1991 and 1992. The 1
st
 Defendant averred that the Plaintiffs had their own parcel of land where they resided. She also emphasized that the Plaintiffs took photos of her developed parcel of land and claimed the developments were effected by them and were on their land. She prayed for the dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ suit.






5.
The 5
th
 Defendant in his Replying Affidavit dated 12
th
 July 2021. stated that he acquired his plot of land, Baragwe/Raimu/1005, in 1992 from Eunice Wanjiru Ngari, who had bought the land from Julius Ngirigaca. He stated that he bought the land with the consent of the first Plaintiff and took immediate possession. Since then, stated he had been in continuous and uninterrupted possession of the land and has made significant developments on it. He averred that the Plaintiffs have been residing and developing land parcel Baragwe/Raimu/1107, which is registered in the name of Charity Wambara Ngirigacha and her late husband Julius Ngirigacha Gaku. He stated that he has been in possession of the land, having fenced his portion in 1992 and planted gravelia robusta trees along some of the boundaries. In the plot he stated he had constructed a four roomed semi-permanent house and that he has mature coffee trees that he harvests. He asserted the Plaintiffs case is based on false holds and ought to be dismissed.






6.
The 1
st
 Defendant filed her Replying Affidavit on 16th July 2021 and averred that she was the registered proprietor of parcel Number Baragwe/Raimu/1008, having purchased the same from Julius Ngirigacha Gaku in October 1990. She stated that the property was transferred to her name on 30
th
 October 1990, and she took vacant possession of the same after the transfer. She asserted that she had been utilizing and cultivating the land since taking possession and disputed the Plaintiffs' claims of occupation and use of her land. She asserted that she legitimately obtained an indefeasible title to the land and without any fraudulent or corrupt activities. She maintained that the Plaintiffs did not bury their father/husband in her portion of land and that the 1
st
 Plaintiff’s matrimonial property is not located there. She urged the Court to conduct a site visit to verify the developments she has made and asked for the dismissal of the Originating Summons with costs.






7.
On 14
th
 November 2022, owing to the varying assertions on occupancy of the suit land, the Court issued directions that the Land Registrar and the County Surveyor to conduct a ground inspection of the property in question to determine the occupancy of each portion of land on the ground. In compliance with this directive, the Land Registrar and the County Surveyor submitted a joint report dated 28
th
 June 2022 (ought to have been 28
th
 June 2023). As the parties had divergent views on whether or not the report should be adopted involved parties to file their written comments/observations by the Court for implementation, the Court invited the parties to make submissions on the issue. The Plaintiffs did not file their written comments/submissions. The 1
st
 and 4
th
 Defendants filed their comments/submissions dated 8
th
 March 2024 and 19
th
 March 2024, respectively.






8.
The 1
st
 Defendant submitted that the report conformed to the evidence that she had given in her Replying Affidavit. She also submitted that she fully associated herself with the findings of the report and called upon the Court to adopt the report. On the other hand, the 4
th
 Defendant similarly submitted that they were in agreement with the report and called upon the Court to adopt the said report as a of this Court.






9.
The only issue to be determined is whether the Surveyor’s reports determine the issues in controversy and whether the said reports ought to be adopted as an order of the Court.






10.
For purposes of clarity, I will reproduce the various reliefs, which the Plaintiffs sought in the Originating Summons dated 30
th
 April, 2021 and filed in Court on 13
th
 May, 2021.
1.
That a permanent injunction be issued restraining the Defendants, their agents, employees, servants, assignees or anybody else claiming through them from entering, trespassing, encroaching, committing acts of wastage, evicting the Plaintiffs or interfering in any other way with the Plaintiffs’ use and occupation of land parcel number Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028, 1073 and 1105 or any part thereof.
2.
That the Defendants’ titles to the land parcels number Baragwe/Raimu/1004,1005,1006,1008,1028,1073 and 1105 be deemed to have been extinguished by the Plaintiffs’ adverse possession and the Plaintiffs be declared to have become entitled to the ownership of the whole of land parcels number Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028, 1073 and 1105 by way of adverse possession.
3.
That the Defendants’ title deeds to land parcels number Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028, 1073 and 1105 and the Defendants’ registration as the owners thereof be cancelled and the Plaintiffs be registered as the proprietors of land parcels number Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028, 1073 and 1105.
4.
That the aforesaid orders be served upon the Land Registrar, Kirinyaga for compliance and where need be, the Executive Officer of this Honourable Court be ordered to execute all the necessary documents and the Lands Registrar be ordered to dispense with the documents necessary for the execution or in compliance with the aforesaid orders.






11.
The Plaintiffs claim as headlined in the Originating Summons was predicated under Section 38 of the 
Limitation of Actions Act
 and Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Rules which anchor the doctrine of adverse possession. Under the doctrine of adverse possession if a person adversely possesses a registered proprietor’s parcel of land openly for a continuous and uninterrupted period of 12 years, the title of the registered proprietor is deemed to be extinguished and the adverse possessor on application to the Court is entitled to be registered as the owner of such land.






12.
In the present suit, the County Surveyor and Registrar provided a comprehensive and elaborate breakdown concerning the ownership of the contested land parcels which the Plaintiffs have claimed through adverse possession. The report by the Officers disclosed that the parcel known as Baragwe/Raimu/1006 is held by the 6th Defendant, who has owned it for 31 years. This parcel is distinguished by its six permanent stone buildings, a garage, an elevated water storage tank, surrounding perimeter walls, and hedge fencing. Moreover, it is cultivated with subsistent crops and is home to a diverse range of trees. Regarding the parcel identified as Baragwe/Raimu/1005, the report indicated it was owned by the 5
th
 Defendant since 1992. This land has a hedge fence, a permanent stone residence, a cow shed, a semi-permanent house, a water tank, facilities for storing animal feed, along with coffee bushes and a diverse assortment of trees. The parcel marked as Baragwe/Raimu/1004 as per the report is owned by the 4
th
 Defendant, who has been in possession of it for 26 years. This particular parcel hosts a semi-permanent structure, a latrine, and a variety of trees, indicating its use and habitation. As for Baragwe/Raimu/1008, it is reported to belong to the 1
st
 Defendant, who has been in possession of the land for over thirty-two years and has planted bananas on it. Regarding Baragwe/Raimu/1028, 1073, and 1106, they are reported to belong to the 2
nd
 Defendant, who has been in possession of the land for over thirty-one years. It is stated that the 2
nd
 Defendant has constructed two semi-permanent houses and planted coffee bushes and a variety of indigenous trees.






13.
As per the report some of the Defendants purchased their land from the Plaintiff’s husband and father, while others acquired the land from third parties. The Land Registrar and the Surveyor as per the report made a physical inspection of the disputed parcels of land in the presence of all the parties. The issue of occupation and possession of the land was all that was disputed. The report in my view is factual and the Surveyor has by way of an illustrated sketch plan indicated all the contested parcels of land and by whom the same are occupied.






14.
The order of reference to the Land Registrar and the County Surveyor was inter alia in the following terms:-
1.
That the Land Registrar and the County Surveyor to hereby visit land parcels BARAGWE/RAIMA/1004, 1006, 1005, 1008, 1028, 1073, 1106, 1105, and 1107 and carry out ground inspection and identify who occupies what portion on the ground.
2.
That the Land Registrar to notify all the parties on the date appointed for the visit and inspection for the parties to be present.
3.
That the Land Registrar and County Surveyor to hereby prepare an indexed plan designating who is in occupation of the specified parcels of land and file a report within 120 days from today (14.11.2022).






15.
The Land Registrar and the Surveyor complied with and implemented the said order of reference. A site inspection was conducted by the Officials on 15
th
 February, 2023 in the presence of all the parties. The Officers in the report indicate they inspected the parcels of land together with their owners. They indicated only Number Baragwe/Raimu/1105 that could not be located on the ground. The 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
, 4
th
 and 6
th
 Plaintiffs were present and must have indicated to the Officers the land they were in occupation of other than land parcel Baragwe/Raimu/1107 which the report indicated belonged to Charity Wambara Ngirigaca, wife to the late Julius Ngirigaca, all the other parcels of land, save for parcel 1105 were said to belong to the Defendants who had developed the same and were in possession thereof.






16.
The only contested issue in this matter is possession of land parcels Baragwe/Raimu/1004, 1005, 1006, 1008, 1028 and 1073. The Land Registrar’s and Surveyor’s report in my view conclusively deals with the issue of possession and I entertain no doubt that, the Plaintiffs cannot controvert the report presented to Court. The Plaintiffs though being the opportunity to make their comments/observations on the report, failed to do so.






17.
The 1
st
 and 4
th
 Defendants filed their comments in support of the report and sought its adoption. As I observed earlier in this ruling the Plaintiffs case was predicated on their ability to prove they had been in adverse possession of the Defendants parcels of land for a continuous and uninterrupted period of not less than 12 years before the filing of the suit. In the face of the report filed by the Land Registrar and the County Surveyor, I am satisfied there is a complete rebuttal of the allegations of adverse possession by the Plaintiffs. Taking the report as part of the evidence in this matter, as I must it is my view that the Plaintiffs case is incapable of being resuscitated by any means. The Land Registrar and the Surveyor being neutral and having no interest in the case, had no reason to give a false report and it is my view the report they prepared renders a mortal blow to the Plaintiffs case rendering it unnecessary to continue entertaining the suit, when the result is as clear as daylight.






18.
Courts should never act in vain and valuable time ought not to be expended on matters that in the first place should never have come to Court. The report by the Land Registrar and the Surveyor has detailed the developments the Defendants have each carried out over a span of over three decades some of which include permanent stone houses, mature cash crops and trees. How then could the Plaintiffs be in adverse possession of such lands? Either the Plaintiffs do not understand what the concept of adverse possession entails and/or are just witch hunters.






19.
I am persuaded the Plaintiffs suit on the face of the Land Registrar’s and Surveyors report discloses no cause of action against the Defendants and/order the Originating Summons struck out in its entirety. I however order that the costs of the struck out suit shall borne by each party.

          (Application for leave to appeal out of time and for stay of execution of decree and judgement issued on 28th April 2023, in Bungoma High Court Civil Suit No. 72 of 2018 by Hon D.K. Kemei, J))
        
      






Ruling










1.
This ruling determines the notice of motion application dated 20
th
 May 2024, brought under certificate of urgency by the Applicant Gilbert Martin Odekeyo which seeks the following orders:
a.
Spent
b.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to extend time to the Applicant to enable him file his notice of appeal out of time.
c.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to stay the execution of the decree and judgement pending determination of the appeal.
d.
That the costs of this application be provided for






2.
The application is premised on grounds on the face of the application and a supporting affidavit sworn by the Applicant sworn on 20
th
 May 2024.






3.
Vide directions as issued by the Court on 10
th
 July 2024, the application was canvassed by way of written submissions. Both parties complied with the Court directives.






4.
The Applicant’s case is that he has an arguable appeal with a high probability of success and that if stay of execution is not granted, his appeal will be rendered nugatory thus exposing him to irreparable damage as the respondent might levy execution against him.






5.
The Applicant further avers that the Judgement of the Court was delivered on 28
th
 April 2023 in the absence of the Applicant and that his counsel on record was not aware of the same as they were never served with the judgement notice.






6.
The Applicant further deponed that he is ready and willing to comply with the directions of the Court.






7.
In response, the Respondent, Alex Wafula Wamwana, swore a replying affidavit on 29
th
 May 2024, contending that the Applicant’s application is bad in law, incompetent and an abuse of the Court process.






8.
It was further deponed that the dismissed appeal was filed by the Applicant herein and that all along he was not keen on prosecuting the same and that since the judgement delivered on 28
th
 April 2023, the Applicant has never bothered to find out the outcome and lodge his appeal against the judgement.






9.
The respondent further contended that the Applicant is not sincere as the Advocate previously on record was aware of the judgement and that the bill of costs was duly served upon the said firm and that they attended Court for taxation as per the Court proceedings.






10.
Further contention was that the Respondent is entitled to costs (taxed costs) and even if the same is paid and the appeal succeeds, the Respondent is a High School teacher by profession and can refund the same. He urged this Court to dismiss the application with costs to the Respondent.






11.
I have considered the application by the Applicant, the grounds, supporting affidavit, grounds of opposition and written submissions for and against the application as supported by cited authorities. In my view, the main issue for determination is whether the application has any merit and therefore whether the orders sought should be granted.






12.
Under Section 79G of the 
Civil Procedure Act
, time for filing an appeal from judgment of the subordinate court to the High Court is thirty (30) days.






13.
In this case, the judgment sought to be challenged was rendered on 28
th
 April 2023. It follows that any appeal challenging that decision ought to have been filed on or before 28
th
 May, 2023. Instead, the Applicant’s counsel failed to file his appeal and has come before this Court seeking to have the time enlarged and the appeal filed out of time validated and be deemed to be duly filed within the time so enlarged.






14.
The Respondent’s counsel vigorously opposes the application stating that the same is an abuse and misuse of judicial process and an afterthought. Further, that the then Counsel for the Applicant was aware of the Judgement delivered and even participated in the Bill of Costs proceedings and that no evidence was availed to rebut the Court proceedings.






15.
An application for extension of time must show good and substantial reasons for the delay, and, prima facie good cause why the intended appeal should be heard. Whilst the first leg requires a satisfactory justification, the second leg only requires one to show that the grounds of appeal are arguable. It is upon satisfaction of both the above that the Court will use its discretion to grant the application.






16.
This discretionary power, however, is judicial in nature and must be confined to the rules of reason and justice. The Supreme Court in Nicholas Kiptoo Arap Korir Salat v Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 7 others {2014} eKLR set out the considerations to guide the Court in exercising its discretion in cases of this nature. It stated: -
i.
Extension of time is not a right of a party. It is an equitable remedy that is only available to a deserving party at the discretion of the court;
ii.
A party who seeks for extension of time has the burden of laying a basis to the satisfaction of the court
iii.
Whether the court should exercise the discretion to extend time, is a consideration to be made on a case-to-case basis;
iv.
Whether there is a reasonable reason for the delay. The delay should be explained to the satisfaction of the court;
v.
Whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the respondents if the extension is granted;
vi.
Whether the application has been brought without undue delay; and
vii.
Whether in certain cases, like election petitions, public interest should be a consideration for extending time.""






17.
In granting leave, the Court has to balance the competing interests of the Applicant with those of the Respondent, a position well stated in M/S Portreitz Maternity v James Karanga Kabia Civil Appeal No 63 of 1997 thus: - “That right of appeal must be balanced against an equally weighty right, that of the plaintiff to enjoy the fruits of the judgment delivered in his favour. There must be a just cause for depriving the plaintiff of that right.”






18.
Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2022 provides: -
“
The court may, on such terms as may be just, by order, extend the time limited by these Rules, or by any decision of the court or of a superior court, for the doing of any act authorized or required by these Rules, whether before or after the doing of the act, and a reference in these Rules to any such time shall be construed as reference to that that time as extended.""






19.
The main reason offered by the Applicant is that he and his former Advocates were not aware when the mater came up for judgement and that they were not served with a judgement notice, and that as per his former Advocates information, the matter came up severally for judgement without the same being delivered. He insisted that the judgement delivered on 28
th
 April 2023 was done so in the absence of his Advocates and that the Respondent vide his Counsels filed a bill of costs which was never served upon his Advocates on record. He further contended that upon delivery of the ruling on the Bill of Costs, the Respondent instructed auctioneers to execute the costs of the Appeal herein and that he was served with a Notice of Proclamation and Warrant of Attachment.






20.
In deciding whether sufficient cause has been shown, among the facts usually relevant are the degree of lateness, the explanation thereof and the prospects of success. This list is not exhaustive and that each case will depend on its peculiar facts and circumstances.






21.
Equally important is that an application for extension of time must be filed without delay and/or as soon as an Applicant becomes aware of the need to do so. Thus, where the Applicant delays filing the application despite being aware of the need to do so, or despite being put on terms, the Court may take a dim view in the absence of a proper and satisfactory explanation for the further delays.






22.
As to whether there is an appeal with chances of success, the Applicant has not annexed any memorandum of appeal to enable this Court consider the chances of success of the same. This is not to say that failure to annex a draft copy of memorandum of appeal would be fatal to the application herein but to demonstrate the arguability of the intended appeal.






23.
I have evaluated the reason offered for the delay. I find and hold that the lack of awareness of the delivery of judgement and ongoing bill of costs proceedings are false. From the Court record, it is evident that the former Advocates were aware of the Judgement as per the order for directions on taxation issuing directions on the Respondent’s Bill of Costs dated 4
th
 May 2023.






24.
In the instant case, the delay by the Applicant in filing the instant appeal has not been explained by the Applicant and that in his attempt to explain to the Court, he has blatantly lied to this Court that he was made aware of the judgment only when he was served with a notice of proclamation and warrant of attachment, when the Respondent sent auctioneers to attach his property in execution for costs. The Respondent has been denied the fruits of his judgement for close to one year now as the Court had to hear both parties on the application after granting a temporary stay of execution of ruling on the bill of costs on 10
th
 July 2024 and fix a date for this ruling. The Applicant has accordingly come to this Court with unclean and dishonest hands and therefore he does not deserve the exercise of discretion of this Court. Indeed, the Applicant had been ably represented by his Advocates all the way to the filing and prosecution of the bill of costs. If anything, it is the Applicant’s Advocates to brief him on the matter. The conduct of the Applicant in taking up a new advocate without calling for the progress of the matter from the former advocate indicated that he is not interested at all about the true situation regarding the delivery of the judgement. The Applicant has himself to blame for the turn of events. It is instructive that the Applicant has not seen it fit to secure a supporting affidavit from his erstwhile advocate regarding the claim that the judgement had been delivered in their absence. This could have bolstered the application. Hence, I find that no good and plausible reasons have been furnished by the Applicant to warrant the orders sought. Granting the application will cause prejudice to the Respondent.






25.
For all the above reasons, I find and hold that the application for enlargement of time to file an appeal out of time challenging judgment in Bungoma High Court Civil Appeal No. 72 of 2018 is devoid of merit. The same is hereby dismissed.






26.
Regarding the issue of whether the prayer for stay of execution of the judgement delivered on the 28
th
 April 2023 is merited, this Court having found that the application for extension of time to file an appeal out of time is devoid of any merit and having dismissed that prayer, it follows that the Court cannot stay execution of the decree of this Court pending nothing.






27.
For all the above reasons, i find and hold that the Applicant’s application dated 20
th
 May 2024 is without merit and is hereby dismissed. Each party to bear their own costs.




It is hereby so ordered.

Ruling










1.
In the Notice of Motion Application dated 18
th
 March, 2024 placed before me, the Plaintiff/Applicant seeks the following orders:
a.
Spent
b.
That the 1
st
 and 5
th
 Respondents herein be arrested and committed to prison for a term not exceeding six (6) months.
c.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to summon the 1
st
 to 5
th
 Defendants/Respondents herein for blatantly disrespecting this Honourable Court by disobeying orders issued by this court 23
rd
 October, 2003.
d.
That the 1
st
 to 5
th
 Respondents herein be arrested and committed to civil j ail for a term not exceeding six (6) months.
e.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to deny the 1
st
 to 5
th
 Defendants/Respondents and their Advocates audience before this Honourable Court until they purge the contempt.
f.
That this Honourable Court be pleased to issue any such or further punitive orders in respect of the said contempt as may be necessary for the ends of justice to be met and towards protection of the dignity and authority of the court.
g.
That the Costs of this Application be provided for.






2.
The Application is based on the grounds set out on the face the Motion and on the Supporting Affidavit of Linah Jeriwo Sang, the Plaintiff herein, sworn on the same date. In her Supporting Affidavit to the Motion, the Plaintiff claims that the she applied for and obtained temporary injunctive orders from this court pending hearing and determination of the suit. That the order was extracted and served on the Defendants through the firm of Anassi Momanyi & Co. Advocates, their Advocates on record. She deponed that despite there being temporary orders, the Defendants have by themselves and through their agents in complete disregard thereto, started construction on the suit property and keep bringing material and they continually bring 3
rd
 Parties to the suit land trying to lease/sell it to the detriment of the Plaintiff.






3.
She deponed that the Defendants continue to dig holes, pit latrines and do other activities that result in wastage and destruction of the suit property, which activities cause depreciation of the land and are introducing other parties to interfere with the Plaintiff’s possession, use and enjoyment thereof. That the Defendants are yet to comply and instead employ delaying tactics to enable their usage and wastage of the land. Further, that the Defendants have blatantly contravened the said court order and it is imperative for this court to give effect to its orders. The Defendants herein ought to be committed to civil jail and/or orders of sequestration be made against them. She averred that it is in the interest of justice that the orders herein be granted to protect the dignity of the court as the actions of the 1
st
 to 5
th
 Defendants are calculated at defeating the substratum of this suit. She added, and that court orders are not in vain.






4.
Each of the 5 Defendants filed a Replying Affidavit, they are all dated 23
rd
 May, 2024 all stating the same facts. In their Affidavits, the Defendants deponed that they have not been served with any court order nor were they informed by their advocate of its existence in this matter. They deponed that they were only notified of the order on the date of making the Affidavits, but they have in no way disobeyed it as they have done nothing contrary to or that amounts to disobedience of the court order exhibited in the Application herein. That the photographs annexed to the Application are not related to them and in fact relate to structures which were on the suit property prior to filing of the suit, and do not relate to structures constructed on the suit land post 23
rd
 October, 2023.






5.
The Defendants deponed that they had not done any of the acts complained of by the Plaintiff despite not being aware of the order herein, nor have they done anything that would constitute wastage or destruction of the suit property. The Defendants deponed that they are not employing delaying tactics nor has the suit ever been set down for hearing. They pointed out that no specific allegation has been made against any of them and averred that they are law-abiding citizens who have not in any way acted in a manner to defeat the substratum of the suit and justice. Lastly, they opposed the application for being fatally defective and incompetent.






6.
The Plaintiff filed a Supplementary Affidavit dated 13
th
 May, 2024 stating that the ruling was delivered on 18
th
 October, 2023 in the presence of the Defendants’ Counsel so he is aware of the outcome. That once the order was extracted, Plaintiff’s Counsel served it on the Defendants advocates on record, the firm of Anassi Momanyi & Company Advocates, and there is no requirement to serve the order on the parties if they are represented unless it is a notice to show cause. She deponed that in further disregard of the court orders, even after service of the Application for contempt, they proceeded to plant maize on the land when it rained. She averred that the Defendants cannot feign ignorance yet continue to act in disregard of the order.






7.
An Affidavit sworn on 14
th
 May, 2024 by Elijah Momanyi Mogona, the Advocate handling this matter on behalf of the Defendants was also filed. Counsel deponed that he has never been served with and is unaware of the orders of the court of 18
th
 October, 2023 since it was never brought to his attention, consequently his clients were unaware of it too since he did not notify them of the decision of the court. He deponed that it is not tenable to assert that the Defendants were aware of the court order without evidence. That the Plaintiff cannot assert that the order was clear without evidence that the same was served on any of the Defendants, and that seeking punishment against the 1
st
 to 5
th
 Defendants for the alleged contempt is thus untenable. Counsel stated that the Plaintiff had not pointed out which of the Defendants is in contempt of the court order and what they had done since the order was made. That from the Plaintiff’s Further Affidavit and Submissions it appears that 3
rd
 Parties with no nexus to the Defendants are the ones undertaking developments. That the photograph is the same as the one in Eldoret E010 of 2023, thus it is not possible to tell which parcel of land the photograph relates.






Applicant’s Submissions


8.
The Motion was canvassed by way of written submissions. In the Plaintiff’s Submissions dated 13
th
 May, 2024, Counsel relied on the case of Samuel M.N. Mweru & Others vs National Land Commission & 2 Others (2020) eKLR on the explanation of contempt and the elements thereof. Counsel submitted that the order given on 18
th
 October, 2023 and issued on 23
rd
 October, 2023 was clear in its terms and timeline and there is no ambiguity or confusion on what it stated. It was submitted that the Defendants’ Advocate on record has been present at every court attendance, including the date when the court delivered the ruling and he was aware of the outcome and ought to have informed his clients. The Defendants cannot thus feign ignorance of the orders of the court and they should be held accountable for their actions. Counsel relied on Econet Wireless Kenya Limited vs Minister for Information and Communication of Kenya & Another (2005) eKLR on the obligation of all persons to obey court orders.






9.
Counsel submitted that the Defendants’ action in disregarding the order and using the suit land knowing the issues in contention have not been resolved amounts to illegal trespass. In addition, that after filing and service of the instant Application, the Defendants deliberately proceeded to plant maize. He argued that the Defendants’ actions are malicious and aimed at ensuring that they use the suit land as long as they can before they are evicted. They added that these actions are detrimental to the Plaintiff and interfere with the sanctity of the court. He relied on the Indian case of T.N. Gadavarman Thiru Mulpad vs Ashok Khot & Another (2005) 5 SCC. He asked that the Application be allowed as prayed.

rd
, 4
th
 and 5
th
 Defendant’s Submissions


10.
The Defendants’ Counsel filed submissions in response dated 20
th
 May, 2024 reiterating that the Defendants were not in court when the order was made and were not served with it, therefore they were unaware of it. He argued that it matters not that the order was clear in its terms since there is no evidence of service of the order either on them or their Advocate, or any indication of the date service was effected. That there is no basis to hold that the Defendants had knowledge of the order. Counsel relied on Sheila Cassatt Issenberg & Another vs Antony Machatha Kinyanjui (2021) eKLR. Counsel urged that in the absence of proof of service or knowledge, the issue of deliberate and wilful disobedience does not arise and cannot be pursued.






11.
Counsel also submitted that from the generalization, it is impossible to know who has done what on either parcel of land. That there is no evidence that the third parties are undertaking the developments with the blessings of the Defendants. Counsel argued that the Plaintiff is under duty to prove her allegations above a balance of probability as was held in Gatharia K. Mutitika vs Baharini Farm Ltd (1985) KLR 227. Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a case to warrant the Defendants being punished for contempt and submitted that the Application ought to be dismissed with costs to the Defendant.








Analysis and Determination


12.
The Court has carefully read and considered the Application herein, affidavits filed in response, submissions, authorities cited and the relevant provisions of law and finds that the issues for determination are;


Whether there are clear and unambiguous orders capable of being obeyed


Whether personal service of the court order is mandatory in contempt proceedings or knowledge of the order is sufficient


Whether the 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
, 4
th
 and 5
th
 Defendants are in contempt of the orders Court made on 18
th
 October, 2023 and issued on 23
rd
 October, 2023








13.
A brief background to this case is that on 23
rd
 February, 2023 the Plaintiff approached this court by way of a Plaint dated 22
nd
 February, 2023 claiming to be the registered owner of the Parcel of land known as Eldoret Municipality Block 15/2429 (hereinafter “the suit property”). She claimed that the Defendants had forcefully and unlawfully entered into the suit land and tilled her land in preparation for the planting season. That they removed her fence and have started erecting illegal structures thereon and have caused malicious damage thereto. She alleged that the said actions amounted to trespass and she sought among other prayers a permanent injunction restraining the Defendants from trespassing onto her land or in any other way dealing with it as well as an eviction order against the Defendants.






14.
Together with the Plaint, the Plaintiff also filed a Notice of Motion dated 22
nd
 February, 2023 under Certificate of Urgency seeking temporary injunctive orders against the Defendants use of the land pending the hearing and determination of this suit. The court considered the application and the court delivered its ruling on 18
th
 October, 2023 granting a temporary injunction restraining the Defendants by themselves or through their Agents from constructing, cultivating, or otherwise utilizing or dealing with the suit property in any way. It is this order that the Plaintiff alleges has been disobeyed by the Defendants and asks the court to punish the Defendants for contempt of its said order.








a. Whether there are clear and unambiguous orders capable of being obeyed


15.
It is imperative that every person against whom or in respect of whom an order is made by a Court of competent jurisdiction has an obligation to obey it unless and until the order is discharged. This obligation is uncompromising and it applies even where one believes the order to be irregular or void. Consequently, courts do not condone deliberate disobedience of orders and will deal firmly with proved contemnors. Courts possess inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders and impose sanctions through contempt of court. The power to punish for contempt is meant to ensure that court processes are not abused and the authority and dignity of the courts is upheld at all times because contempt of court by its very nature demeans the integrity and authority of Courts and disparages the rule of law.






16.
The Black’s Law Dictionary (11
th
 Edition) defines contempt of court as:-
“
Conduct that defies the authority or dignity of a court or legislature. Because such conduct interferes with the administration of justice, it is punishable usually by fine or imprisonment.”






17.
The instructive provision on contempt of court is Section 5 (1) of the 
Judicature Act
, which grants the High Court and the Court of Appeal the power to punish for contempt. Additionally, for this court, Section 29 of the 
Environment and Land Court Act
 provides that:-
“
Any person who refuses, fails or neglects to obey an order or direction of the Court given under this Act, commits an offence, and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty million shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both.”






18.
This Court, therefore, has inherent powers under the 
Judicature Act
 as well as Section 29 of the 
Environment and Land Court Act
. The jurisdiction of the superior courts to punish litigants for contempt of court when they fail or refuse to obey court orders is aimed at protecting the dignity and legitimacy of the courts. The test applicable in an application for contempt, was well set out in Samuel M. N. Mweru & Others vs National Land Commission & 2 others [2020] eKLR where the court held that:-
“
40.
It is an established principle of law that in order to succeed in civil contempt proceedings, the applicant has to prove (i) the terms of the order, (ii) Knowledge of these terms by the Respondent, (iii). Failure by the Respondent to comply with the terms of the order. Upon proof of these requirements the presence of willfulness and bad faith on the part of the Respondent would normally be inferred, but the Respondent could rebut this inference by contrary proof on a balance of probabilities. Perhaps the most comprehensive of the elements of civil contempt was stated by the learned authors of the book Contempt in Modern New Zealand who succinctly stated:-
‘There are essentially four elements that must be proved to make the case for civil contempt. The applicant must prove to the required standard (in civil contempt cases which is higher than civil cases) that:-
(a)
the terms of the order (or injunction or undertaking) were clear and unambiguous and were binding on the defendant;
(b)
the defendant had knowledge of or proper notice of the terms of the order;
(c)
the defendant has acted in breach of the terms of the order; and
(d)
the defendant's conduct was deliberate’.”






19.
The first question to be determined with regards to contempt of court, is whether there is a valid order capable of being obeyed. This limb also requires that the order must be clear and unambiguous. On the 18
th
 October, 2023 the court pronounced itself on the Plaintiff’s Application dated 22
nd
 February, 2023 in the presence of both counsel for the Plaintiff and the Defendants. The words of the court in ruling as well as the injunctive order from which this application emanates as extracted reads as follows:-
“
A temporary injunction be and is hereby granted restraining the Defendants/Respondents either by themselves, their agents, servants and/or anyone claiming under them from constructing structures, cultivating, utilizing, selling, charging, leasing, subdividing, wasting or otherwise interfering with all that parcel of land known as ELDORET MUNICIPALITY BLOCK 15/2429 pending hearing and determination of the suit herein.”






20.
The order is clear and unambiguous and there has been no complaint from the Defendants that it was ambiguous or confusing in any way. For this reason, this court finds that there were in existence clear and unambiguous orders capable of being executed and/or obeyed by the Defendants.








b. Whether personal service of the court order is mandatory in contempt proceedings or knowledge of the order is sufficient


21.
Secondly, it is a requirement that the party alleged to have breached the order must have had actual knowledge of it. The Plaintiff has stated that the Defendants were duly served with the order but failed to comply. The Plaintiff also argued that the ruling in respect of which the order emanated from was delivered in the presence of Counsel for the Defendants and therefore they ought to have been aware of it. In response, the Defendants and their Counsel have all averred that they were not served and neither were they aware of the existence of the relevant order of the court.






22.
I agree with the Defendants assertion that in order to prove that they willfully and/or deliberately disobeyed the court order, it has to be shown that the Defendants were aware of the order to begin with. Previously, courts were of the opinion that this awareness of the order was proved by establishing personal service of the subject order and the attendant penal notice upon the alleged contemnor (see in Nyamogo & Another vs Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (1994) KLR 141). This position has however shifted in recent years, and courts have held that it is sufficient for the applicant to demonstrate awareness and/or knowledge by the alleged contemnor of the orders. Had the Defendants made their contention before this shift in jurisprudence, this court would have insisted that personal service of the orders in question was mandatory. However, as the law stands right now, personal service of the order upon the contemnor is not necessary where knowledge of the order is proved.






23.
This court is alive to and ascribes to the changes in the jurisprudence in this area of law to the effect that knowledge of an order supersedes personal service. In Kenya Tea Growers Association vs Francis Atwoli & Others (2012) eKLR, the Respondents claimed that they were unaware of the Court Order until they saw it in a newspaper over a month after it was issued and that they were not served with the Court orders and therefore they could not be said to be in contempt, but the court held that:-
“
On this issue, our Courts seem to have moved steadily towards the position that although Order 52 Rules 3 and 4 of the Supreme Court Practice Rules of England would point towards personal service as a factor in determining contempt, in fact knowledge of an order is higher than service. It is common ground that neither of the alleged contemnors was ever directly served and that leaves the issue whether they had knowledge of the order prior to 18
th
 October 2010. On that issue, I have the evidence of Isaac Kiprotich Maswai, Philip Kibii Cheruiyot and Emmanuel Ng’etich before me. They all stated, on oath, that they heard Francis Atwoli uttering words whose import was to confirm that not only was he aware and had knowledge of the Order but he also challenged it as having been given without jurisdiction. Cheruiyot went further to produce a transcription of words that he recorded as having been uttered by Atwoli and which I have reproduced above.”






24.
In the case of Kenya Tea Growers Association vs Francis Atwoli (supra) Lenaola J went on to find that he was satisfied that the alleged contemnors had knowledge of the Court Order. The rationale behind this change appears to be the need to protect the integrity and dignity of Court orders. To excuse a contemnor who has knowledge of a Court order simply because he has not been personally served is to open up Court orders and process to deliberate, wilful, contemptuous and cynical disobedience. This position has been endorsed repeatedly by the Court of Appeal, for instance in Shimmers Plaza Limited vs National Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR, the court held that:-
“
We now revisit the issue of service. Was there service of the order said to have been disobeyed on the respondent? There is no dispute that no formal order was extracted and personally served on the respondent and an affidavit of service filed to that effect.``
In that respect, this case can be distinguished from Justus Kariuki Mate & Another vs Hon. Martin Wambora (Wambora case) supra cited by learned counsel for the applicant.
On the other hand however, this Court has slowly and gradually moved from the position that service of the order along with the penal notice must be personally served on a person before contempt can be proved. This is in line with the dispensations covered under 81.8 (1) (supra).
Kenya's growing jurisprudence right from the High court has reiterated that knowledge of a court order suffices to prove service and dispense with personal service for the purposes of contempt proceedings. For instance, Lenaola J in the case of Basil Criticos vs Attorney General and 8 Others [2012] eKLR pronounced himself as follows:-
“
...the law has changed and as it stands today knowledge supersedes personal service…where a party clearly acts and shows that he had knowledge of a Court Order; the strict requirement that personal service must be proved is rendered unnecessary”






25.
The Court of Appeal similarly pronounced itself in Woburn Estate Limited vs Margaret Bashforth [2016] eKLR citing the decision in Refrigeration and Kitchen Utensils Ltd v Gulabchand Popatlal Shah & Another, Nairobi Civil Applicati
on No.39 of 1990
, where it was observed that:-
“
A party who knows of an order, whether null or valid, regular or irregular, cannot be permitted to disobey it… It would be most dangerous to hold that the suitors, or their solicitors, could themselves judge whether an order was null or valid-whether it was regular or irregular. That they should come to the court and not take upon themselves to determine such a question…he should apply to the court that it might be discharged. As long as it exists it must not be disobeyed.”






26.
The above provision takes cognizance of the fact that personal service may not be achieved in some circumstances. For these reasons, this court will not hesitate to hold that where a party has knowledge of a court order, personal service is not mandatory. In the instant application, the ruling in respect of which the orders were made was delivered on 18
th
 October, 2023 in the presence of both Miss. Adongo, Counsel for the Plaintiff and Mr. Momanyi, Counsel for the Defendants. For this reason, Mr. Momanyi cannot be heard to say that he was not aware of the existence of the order as the record shows he had full knowledge of it.  Furthermore, Order 5, Rule 8(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules states that;
“
Wherever it is practicable, service shall be made on the defendant in person unless he has an agent empowered to accept service, in which case service on the agent shall be sufficient”.






27.
Counsel represents the interests of their clients, therefore, where orders are made in the presence of Counsel for a party, it is expected that Counsel will inform their clients of the decision of the court. The Defendants are thus presumed to be have knowledge of the existence and terms of the court order in question. In Shimmers Plaza Limited vs National Bank of Kenya (Supra), the court held that:-
“
The dispensation of service under rule 81.8 (1) is subject to whether the person can be said to have had notice of the terms of the judgment or order. The notice of the order is satisfied if the person or his agent can be said to either have been present when the judgment or order was given or made; or was notified of its terms by telephone, email or otherwise. In our view, 'otherwise' would mean any other action that can be proved to have facilitated the person having come into knowledge of the terms of the judgment and/or order. This would definitely include a situation where a person is represented in court by counsel. Once the applicant has proved notice, the respondent bears an evidential burden in relation to wilfulness and mala fides disobedience. This Court in the Wambora case (supra) affirmed the application of these requirements.”






28.
From the foregoing, it becomes apparent that the Defendants having been represented in this suit by Counsel, who was present in court when the ruling was delivered, are well aware of the injunctive order issued herein. This court certainly finds so.








c. Whether the 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
, 4
th
 and 5
th
 Defendants are in contempt of the orders Court made on 18
th
 October, 2023 and issued on 23
rd
 October, 2023


29.
It trite that a court order must be obeyed whether a party agrees with its contents or not, and as long as the order still subsists, then it remains a valid court order that must be adhered to. The adherence to the court order is not optional even if a party has applied for review, variation or appeal of the said order. In the case of Kenya Tea Growers Association vs Francis Atwoli and 5 Others (supra) Lenaola J cited with approval the case of Clarke and Others vs Chadburn & Others [1985] 1All E.R (PC), 211 in which the court observed that:
“
I need not cite authority for the proposition that it is of high importance that orders of the courts should be obeyed, willful disobedience to an order of the court is punishable as a contempt of court, and I feel no doubt that such disobedience may properly be described as being illegal…even if the Defendants thought that the injunction was improperly obtained or too wide in its terms, that provides no excuse for disobeying it. The remedy is to vary or discharge it.”






30.
This court has already found that the Defendants had knowledge of the orders of this court. There is no doubt that the orders have been in force since they were issued and have neither been discharged, varied or set aside. The court granted the injunction on a temporary basis pending the hearing and determination of the suit herein. The question now is whether the Defendants have contravened the order of court restraining them from any dealings on the suit property as well as whether this contravention was deliberate.






31.
Among the prayers sought in the instant Application is committal to civil jail, which will result in denying the Defendants their liberty. It is for this reason that the standard of proof in contempt matters is higher than that of ordinary civil matters. In the case of Mutitika vs Baharini Farm Limited [1985] KLR 229, 234 the Court of Appeal held that:
“
In our view, the standard of proof in contempt proceedings must be higher than proof on the balance of probabilities, almost but not exactly, beyond reasonable doubt...The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt ought to be left where it belongs, to wit, in criminal cases. It is not safe to extend it to an offence which can be said to be quasi-criminal in nature. The rationale for this standard is that if cited for contempt, and the prayer sought is for committal to jail, the liberty of the contemnor will be affected. As such, the standard of proof is higher than the standard in civil cases. This power, to commit a person to jail, must be exercised with utmost care, and exercised only as a last resort. It is of utmost importance, therefore, for the respondents to establish that the alleged contemnor’s conduct was deliberate, in the sense that he or she willfully acted in a manner that flouted the Court Order.”






32.
This then means that the violation that the Defendants are accused of must be proved to a standard which though not as high as proof beyond reasonable doubt, must is higher than proof on a balance of probabilities. The threshold is quite high as it involves possible deprivation of a person’s liberty. It is important therefore that the court satisfies itself that first, the acts complained of actually happened, secondly, that the person alleged to be in contempt committed the acts complained of and lastly, he did so with full knowledge of the existence of the order of the court forbidding it. It needs no mention that the burden of proving that the Defendants did disobey the court order lays squarely on Plaintiff.






33.
In the Application herein, no specific date(s) has been given as the date(s) when the Defendants deliberately carried out the acts of disobedience of the court order. The photographs annexed to the Plaintiff’s Supporting Affidavit bear no date stamp, therefore it cannot be said with certainty when the structures shown therein were built. This court cannot dismiss the Defendant’s claim that the structures existed prior to the filing of this case. I have compared those photographs to the photograph annexed to the previous Application dated 22
nd
 February, 2023 and note that the Photographs annexed to the application show a fence and a road next to the property, while in the photographs annexed to the earlier application, there is no road. The photographs appear to be of different sections of the land and cannot provide a proper comparison of the status of the land prior to issuance of the order and the current status after the order was made. I am unable to state with certainty that these are new structures that did not exist before the suit. I have seen no building materials deposited on the suit property as alleged from the said from photograph. There is no proof of holes or pit latrines built after issuance of the injunctive orders as alleged.






34.
There is an alleged repeat disobedience raised in the Plaintiff’s Supplementary Affidavit, where the Plaintiff claims the Defendants planted maize on the suit property when it rained, which was after filing and service of the instant Motion. Although the court can give a rough estimate of how old the said maize is, the photograph annexed to the Supplementary Affidavit does not bear a date and/or timestamp thus it is impossible to determine approximately, when it was planted. Maize being a seasonal food crop, without a date on the photographs, this court is not able to state with certainty whether the maize was recently planted or whether it is a photo taken from a different planting season. Aside from the alleged planting of maize, there is no evidence to show any difference in the layout of the land before and after the other alleged acts of contempt. The photographs are therefore inconclusive in that regard.






35.
Nevertheless, if indeed it is the Defendants who planted the maize on the land, then that conduct was deliberate, in the sense that they willfully acted in a manner that flouted the said Order. No doubt, if the Plaintiff had tendered sufficient evidence of the Defendants’ disobedience, this court would have made a finding to that effect. However, the evidence presented in this instant Motion falls short of the required standard. The Defendants are reminded that the injunctive orders are still in place, so for the avoidance of doubt, should the Defendants disregard them by tilling, weeding, or going into the land to cultivate maize or other crops growing thereon (if any),or harvesting the same or in any other way acting contrary to the said orders, those will be separate acts of trespass and disobedience. Parties should thus bear in mind that this application or the outcome herein will not act as a bar to subsequent prosecution for any future acts of trespass/disobedience.






36.
However, for purposes of the Application herein, the Plaintiff has failed to prove that the acts of contempt took place on the suit property after the issuance of injunctive orders by this court. That being so, the Plaintiff’s application has fallen short of establishing that the Defendants are guilty of disobeying the order of this court dated 23
rd
 October, 2023. In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s application dated 18
th
 March, 2024 is dismissed with costs.

Ruling










1.
The Notice of motion application dated 1
st
 December 2020 (the application is not in the court file) by the defendant herein prays for the following orders;
i.
That the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 and filed in Court on 27
th
 October 2020 be struck out with costs for disclosing no reasonable and or actionable cause of action against the Defendant.
ii.
That the costs of this application be borne by the plaintiff.






2.
The application is premised on the following grounds:
i.
That the Plaintiff’s claim of Ksh 17,173,523.60 arises from a Judgment entered in favour of the Plaintiff against Sam Con Limited in Nakuru HCCC 39 of 2003, wherein the defendant was not a party.
ii.
That the defendant’s only relationship with Sam Con Limited was that of a Secured Creditor or a debenture holder.
iii.
That since the defendant was not an agent of Sam Con Limited, nor of the Receivers and Mangers appointed over Sam Con Limited, the Plaintiff cannot seek to enforce a Judgment against Sam Con Limited from the defendant.
iv.
That it is trite law that Receivers are not agents of the debenture holder, but agents of the company.
v.
That the plaintiff having sued the company that was placed under receivership, lacks valid cause of action against the defendant, and the plaint ought to be struck out.
vi.
That the plaintiff herein having obtained judgment against a company that was placed under receivership their claim lies against the receivers or the company itself, and not the defendant.






3.
In response to the application, the plaintiff/respondent filed a replying affidavit dated 20
th
 March 2024. He averred that the basis of its claim against the defendant was the contention under paragraph 3 of the plaint. Further, that the seizure of its property was done by the defendant’s agent and the Court in HCCC of 39 of 2003 found the said act to have been illegal.






4.
He averred further that the defendant/applicant under paragraph 3 of its defence admits that it placed Sam-Con Limited under receivership pursuant to some debentures. Therefore, that as a matter of law it should be held liable for the misfeasance of its managers or receivers who are in law its agents. He added that the receivers who was discharging their mandate wrongfully took possession of its assets and made it incur loss to the extent upheld by the honourable court is almost a foregone as a legal conclusion.






5.
He went to aver that apart from the pleadings, he was aware that at the hearing of the primary suit, the defendant's witness was indeed a retired manager of the defendant herein hence the nexus between the defendant and the plaintiff’s claim. Therefore, that the defendant’s liability for the illegal acts of its agents had been clearly established. He added that its claim was not as a creditor of Sam-Con Limited, but had stored its’ assets at defendant’s premises as the Court found. That the assets were not lost by Sam-Con Limited, but by the receivers appointed by the defendant and had refused to release the stored assets.






6.
He averred that the defendant's defence itself, even without more, identified a number of issues including the one on whether or not the plaintiff herein was a creditor of Sam-Con Limited, and whether it's claim is in respect of illegal and ultra-vires acts of the agents of the defendant herein. He urged the court to dismiss the application with costs.






7.
The defendant/applicant additionally filed an undated supplementary affidavit sworn by its managing director where he reiterated the contents of the replying affidavit. The same is dated 21
st
 May, 2024. He averred that the suit by its pleadings alone was so hopeless and deserved striking out. Further, that the suit is so clear cut and should be allowed summarily as the amount due has already been determined while liability is clearly demonstrable if not so evident.






8.
The application was canvassed by way of written submissions.






Defendant/applicant’s submissions


9.
These were filed by Michael, Daud & Associates Advocates and are dated 8
th
 April 2024. Counsel gave a brief background of the case and identified one issue for determination by this court, which is whether this honourable court should strike out the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action.






10.
Counsel placed reliance on Order 2 rule 15 (1)(a) of the Civil Procedure Rules, 2010 and the decisions in Dickson Maina v Kenya Electricity Generating Company & Another [2021] eKLR and D. T. Dobie & Company (Kenya) Ltd v Muchina [1982] KLR 1 at page 9. He submitted that the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 sought to execute the sum of kshs, 17,173,523.60 being the decretal sum from a judgment in Nakuru HCCC No. 39 of 2003 Bhogals Garage limited vs Zahir Sheikh & Andrew Gregory (Joint Receivers & Managers) Samcon Ltd in receivership) delivered on 30
th
 January 2020 and the defendant was not a party to the said suit.






11.
He submitted further that executing against a non-party will be a violation of Article 50 of 
the Constitution
 of Kenya. Additionally, that the plaintiff/respondent in his replying affidavit has averred that the fact that the defendant/applicant appointed the receiver and manager, by law they became their agents. Further, that the debenture attached therein, clause 8 provided that a receiver manager shall be liable for their acts, defaults and remuneration. Therefore, that without a doubt the receiver and manager were agents of Sam-Con Limited and not the defendant/applicant herein.






12.
He went on to submit that for the said reasons it was clear that the plaint disclosed no reasonable cause of action as the debenture instrument signed by Sam-Con limited defines them as the principal of the receiver and manager. Further, that as per clause 7 of the debenture, the defendant’s/applicant’s role was only limited to appointing the receiver and manager and that once that was done the defendant/applicant became a secured creditor whose only interest was to recover monies owed to it. He urged the court to allow the application with costs to the plaintiff.








Plaintiff’s/respondent’s submissions


13.
These were filed by Sheth & Wathigo Advocates and are dated 11
th
 April 2024. Counsel gave a brief background of the case and identified two issues for determination by this court.






14.
The first issue is whether the application is merited. Counsel equally relied on Order 2 rule 15 (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules and the decisions in D.T. Dobie & Co. (Kenya) Limited v Muchina & Another (supra) and The Co-operative Merchant Bank Ltd v George Fredrick Wekesa (Civil Appeal No. 54 of 1999). She submitted that striking out of the plaintiff’s /respondent’s pleadings would be unjust and a violation of the constitutional edicts that promote access to justice. Further, that the illegal seizure of the plaintiff/respondent’s property was done by the agents of the defendant/respondent and it was therefore liable for the said acts.






15.
She submitted further that the cause of action against the defendant/applicant ought to be determined at the hearing stage and not at an interlocutory stage. She added that it was an elementary principle of company law that receivers appointed under debenture became agents of their particular appointing authorities. Further, that the agent of the debenture holders and their actions which they undertook in the course of the receivership automatically bound the said debenture holders who appointed them and for whose benefit they acted.






16.
The court’ attention was drawn to the scholarly work of Avin Lightman and Gabriel Moss titled “The Law of Receivers and Companies,” London: Sweet & Maxwell [1986] at paragraph 202 on page 6 and the decisions in Surya Holding Limited & 2 Others v CFC Stanbic Bank Limited [2014] eKLR and Joseph Ashioya & 165 Others v Kenya United Steel Co [2006] Ltd & Another [2013] eklr.






17.
On who should bear the costs of the application, counsel urged the court to award the plaintiff /respondent the said costs.








Analysis and determination


18.
I have carefully considered the application, the affidavits and the submissions by both parties. I find the main issue for determination to be whether the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 by the plaintiff/respondent discloses a reasonable cause of action.






19.
Order 2 Rule 15 of the Civil Procedure Rules which provides for striking out of pleadings states as follows:
Rule 15
“(1)
At any stage of the proceedings the court may order to be struck out or amended any pleading on the ground that—
(a)
it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence in law; or
(b)
it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
(c)
it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
(d)
it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court, and may order the suit to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
(2)
No evidence shall be admissible on an application under sub rule (1)(a) but the application shall state concisely the grounds on which it is made.”






20.
The Court of Appeal in Swapan Sadhan Bose v Nyali Beach Hotel Limited & 3 others [2011] eKLR held as follows;
“
…As it has been stated in some of the cases cited to us, the power of the Court to strike out pleadings is exercised without the court being fully informed on the merits of the case through discovery and oral evidence and hence this power to strike out pleadings should be used sparingly and cautiously. In D.T. Dobiie & Company (Kenya) Ltd. v. Muchina [1982] KLR 1 at p. 9 Madan, J.A. said:-
“No suit ought to be summarily dismissed unless it appears so hopeless that it plainly and obviously discloses no reasonable cause of action and is so weak as to be beyond redemption and incurable by amendment. If a suit shows a mere semblance of a cause of action, provided it can be injected with real life by amendment, it ought to be allowed to go forward for a court of justice ought not to act in darkness without the full facts of a case before it.”






21.
The plaintiff/respondent in its plaint alleges that on 16
th
 January 2003 the defendant/applicant appointed Zahir Sheikh & Andrew Grecory to act as joint receivers and managers of Sam-con Limited. It further alleges that on the 30
th
 January 2020, judgment was entered against the defendant (in the primary suit) in Nakuru HCCC No. 39 of 2003 for a sum of Kenya Shillings Seven Million One Hundred and Fifty-Six Thousand, Five hundred (Kshs. 7,156,500/=) as compensation for the value of the equipment and machinery stored in its premises from the year 2000 which equipment had been declared obsolete.






22.
The plaintiff/respondent also alleges that the defendant's witness in the subject suit confirmed on oath in his testimony in court that he was an employee of the defendant/applicant herein and that the detainment of the plaintiff’s/respondent’s assets by the receivers aforesaid was on instructions and behalf of the defendant/applicant. Thus, upon entry of the said Judgment the defendant/applicant was liable to satisfy it by paying the plaintiff the aforementioned sum plus costs of the suit and interest at court rates.






23.
In view of the above, it is evident that the plaintiff/respondent’s claim is that of recovering sums awarded to it as compensation in the judgment delivered in Civil Case Number 39 of 2003 between it and Zahir Sheikh & Andrew Gregory (Joint Receivers & Managers) Sam - Con Limited in Receivership. It is not in dispute that the defendant/applicant appointed the aforementioned receiver managers for Sam-Con Limited. The defendant/applicant has argued that upon the appointment of the said receivers it became a secured creditor and it was not liable for their actions. Further, that it was not a party in the primary suit and therefore not liable to satisfy the decree in the aforementioned case.






24.
In Surya Holdings Limited & 2 others v CFC Stanbic Bank Limited (Supra) also relied on by the plaintiff/respondent, the court observed as follows;
“
74.
The Receivers herein are agents of the company. On the prima facie material before me; they are competent and were properly appointed. They draw their powers and duties from the law and the debentures on which they are appointed which they must exercise throughout for the benefit of the debenture holders and the company to the extent of their respective interests in the assets he holds. I am guided by “Kerr On the Law and practice as to receivers” (16
th
 Edition) London: Sweet and Maxwell (1983) at page 331 that:
“Although the receiver is technically the principal, yet of course he is not acting on his own behalf. He is still acting as receiver of the company, and his possession and control is throughout for the benefit of the debenture holders and the company to the extent of their respective interests in the assets he holds.”






25.
Further, in Kabiyet Agro and General Enterprises Limited (In Receivership) v Benard Rop & another [2018] eKLR the court observed as follows;
“
….Further clause 15 of the Debenture instrument thereof makes the Receiver and Manager an agent of the Company and grants him the power to sell the charged property in any manner he deems fit as follows :-
15.
""Every Receiver so appointed shall be deemed to be the agent of the Company and the Company shall alone be liable for his acts, defaults and remuneration and he shall have the authority and be entitled to exercise the powers hereinafter set forth in addition to and without limiting any genera/ powers conferred upon him by law:-
(d)
To sell or assign or concur in selling letting or assigning any of the property and assets hereby charged or agreed to be charged in such manner and generally on such terms and conditions as he shall think fit and in the name of the Company to carry any such sale letting or assignment into effect.
(i)
To do all such other acts and things as may be considered to be incidental or conducive to any of the matter and powers aforesaid and which such Receiver can or may lawfully do as agent for the Company.”






26.
In light of the above cited authorities, there is no doubt that the receivers and managers appointed by a bank (debenture holder) act as agents of the company (debtor). Further, a debenture is presumed to have a clause on appointment of receivers, their liability and their acting as agents of the company in receivership.






27.
In the instant case, the defendant/applicant annexed in its application dated 4
th
 April 2022 and filed in court on 22
nd
 April 2022, the debenture instrument which reads under clause 8 as follows;
“
A receiver and manager so appointed shall be the agent of the Company and the Company shall be liable for his acts defaults and remuneration and he shall have authority and be entitled to exercise the powers hereinafter act forth in addition to and without limiting any general powers conferred upon him by law.”






28.
Clearly, the debenture instrument at clause 8 thereof makes the Receiver and Manager an agent of the Company and the said company is liable for their acts or omissions. The judgment was entered against Zahir Sheikh & Andrew Grecory appointed receivers and managers of San-Con (in receivership) and not the defendant/applicant herein. In the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 the plaintiff/respondent has sought for a declaration that the defendant/applicant pay a total of kshs. 17,173,523.60/= this being the award, interest and costs in Nakuru HCCC No. 39 of 2003.






29.
In view of the above, it is evident that the plaintiff/respondent’s claim in the said plaint is against the wrong party, that is the defendant/applicant who was not a party to that suit. Further, the debenture instrument shields it from any liability for the acts, defaults or remuneration of the receivers and managers. The company (Sam-Con Limited) under receivership is solely liable for their acts by virtue of them being its agents.






30.
For the said reasons, it is my view that the plaint dated 1
st
 September 2020 does not disclose any reasonable cause of action and the same is hereby dismissed with costs.






31.
Orders accordingly

Emily Mukhwana Wanjekeche


 


Accused










Judgment










1.
The accused herein Emily Mukhwana Wanjekeche has been charged with an offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code. The particulars are that on the 19
th
 day of July, 2017, at Brigadier area, Kiminini location in Bungoma North Sub– County within Bungoma County, she murdered Jonathan Barasa Burudi.






2.
The prosecution called seven (7) witness in support of its case. PWI was Selina Nanyama Mandila who testified that she was a traditional herbalist and who had treated the deceased to a cocktail of herbal concoctions for a long period. She confirmed having prescribed some herbal concoctions to the deceased and was shocked to learn about his death.
On cross – examination, she testified that she had treated the deceased for over four years. That she did not know the cause of death.






3.
Simon Wamela Burudi (PW2) testified that the deceased was his elder brother. He stated that he received the report that the deceased was quite ill and had diarrohea with blood as well as vomiting. That he rushed to the hospital and had him transferred to Mediheal hospital for endoscopy but he died before the tests could be carried out. He stated that he witnessed the autopsy on the body of the deceased and that some stomach contents were collected for analysis which later revealed that the deceased had sustained severe bleeding which corroded the intestines and that the loss of blood led to anaemia.
On cross examination, he confirmed that the deceased used to take herbal medicine for his stroke. That the family was concerned about how the money had been spent between the date of withdrawal and death of the deceased. That he could not tell from where the poisonous substance recovered from the house of the deceased came from. That it is the accused who brought the substance and handed it over to the police. That he could not tell if the accused was involved in the murder.






4.
Martha Akasa Barasa (PW3) testified that the deceased was her father and who used to suffer from ulcers and used to bleed frequently and that he used to live with the accused peacefully.
On cross examination, she stated that she did not know anything about the alleged poison. She further added that she had not been alerted by the deceased about any fears from the accused.






5.
Barasa Nato Teka (PW4) testified that the deceased was his father and that he found the deceased at the hospital in bad condition. He stated that the post -mortem examination revealed that the deceased had ingested poison.
On cross examination, he stated that he is not a biological child of the deceased. He added that he is aware that the deceased suffered internal bleeding and that he has no evidence linking the accused to the death of deceased.






6.
No. 78788 PC John Kulecho ( PW5) testified that he received a report from Anette Barasa. That the deceased had died under unclear circumstances. He stated that an autopsy was conducted at Cheranganyi Nursing Home wherein the pathologist established that the deceased had been poisoned. He stated that he collected some stomach contents and then visited the home of the deceased where he recovered some liquid substance in a water bottle which the accused claimed had been supplied to the deceased by a herbalist. He added that he handed the specimens to his colleague PC Felix Oduor to escort them to the Government Chemist in Nairobi. He further added that he learnt that the deceased had withdrawn a sum of Kshs. 460,000/- from a certain bank and that he later received a withdrawal slip and two copies of certificate of death. He finally stated that an insecticide had been detected in the liquid which was inside a water bottle.
On cross-examination, he stated that he charged the accused because she was the only person living with the deceased. He stated that the herbal concoction which was recovered had been supplied to the deceased by a traditional herbalist. He also confirmed that he had preferred an inquest vide inquest number 3 of 2018 at Kimilili law courts. He also stated that the pathologist did not indicate the issue of poison in his report.
On re- examination, he stated that the accused did not give him a satisfactory answer as to how the deceased met his death.






7.
Dr Ombongi Harun (PW6) testified that the autopsy on the body of the deceased had been carried out by Dr. Patrick Masita who is currently outside the country pursing further studies. He sought to produce the autopsy report on his behalf since he was familiar with his handwriting and signatures having worked with him in the past at Kitale District Hospital. He testified that blood oozed from the orifices and that there was some inflammation along the gastric mucosa and that the entire mucosa of the small gut was severely hyperemic and hemorrhagic. He stated that the cause of death was severe anaemia due to gastro intestinal tract bleeding. He produced the autopsy report as exhibit 2.
On cross examination, he stated that there are many causes of severe anaemia and that the cause of death could be due to several probabilities.






8.
Stephen Matinde Joel Weibe (PW7) was the Government Analyst. He testified that he detected a substance called amitraz which is an insecticide and poisonous when ingested. He formed the opinion that prior to his death, the deceased had ingested the insecticide. He produced the report and exhibit memo form as exhibits 7A and 7 B respectively. On cross examination, he stated that pesticides and insecticides re harmful if ingested.






9.
Upon the accused being placed on her defence, she tendered a sworn testimony. Her case is that the deceased was her husband with whom they got married in 1992 and that they were blessed with five children. She testified that the deceased later divorced his first wife Annette Nasimiyu Siundu vide Webuye Divorce Cause No. 3 of 2007. She stated that the deceased suffered from diabetes, stroke, blood pressure and ulcers. She testified that the deceased used to be attended to by a traditional herbalist as from 2009. She stated that in 2017 the deceased started experiencing swollen feet and lower abdomen. She testified that the herbal concoctions used to be contained in bottles. She denied poisoning her husband whom she loved and took care of plus the children. She stated that upon the death of the deceased, she has had no peace since her co- wife and her in-laws lodged a case at Kimilili Law Courts over some parcel of land as well as benefits of the deceased since their aim is to disinherit her and her children from the benefits which are still being held by the Public Trustee. She finally stated that she is still the administrator of the deceased’s estate.
On cross examination, she stated that she was the one taking care of the deceased. That the alleged poison was the work of the deceased’s brother when the deceased was moved to another hospital. That she does not know the origin of the alleged pesticide. That she did not participate in the prescription of the herbal concoction as the herbalist used to do that.
On re- examination, she stated that she could not have known if the herbal concoctions were poisonous. That she did not keep any pesticides in her home.






10.
Parties were directed to file and exchange submissions. It is only the defence that complied.






11.
I have considered the evidence tendered by both the prosecution and defence as well as the submissions filed. I find the only issue for determination is whether the prosecution proved its case against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt. It is trite law that the burden to prove all the ingredients of the offence herein falls on the prosecution in all cases save for a few statutory offences. The standard of proof in all criminal cases is that of beyond any reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt has however been stated not to mean proof beyond any shadow of doubt. The standard is discharged when the evidence against the accused is so strong that only a little doubt is left in his favour. See Miller -vs Minister of Pensions [1943] ALL ER 372. In discharging the burden cast upon it by law, the prosecution is required to adduce strong evidence to place the accused at the scene of crime as the assailant since he/she does not have the burden to prove his/her innocence or to justify his alibi. For a conviction to be secured, the court considers the strength of the evidence by the prosecution and not the weakness of the defence by the accused.






12.
The four ingredients that the prosecution is required to prove in a charge of murder are inter alia; that there was death of a human being; that the death was unlawfully caused with malice aforethought; that the accused directly or indirectly caused the death.






13.
As to the fact of death , there is a post mortem report produced as exhibit 2 by Dr Ombongi Harun ( PW6) who formed the opinion that the cause of death was severe anaemia due to severe acute, lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. This ingredient of the offence was duly proved by the prosecution.






14.
As to the unlawful nature of the death, the law presumes every homicide to be unlawful unless it occurs as a result of an accident or is one authorized by law. See Republic -vs Boniface Isawa Makodi [ 2016] eKLR that referred to the case of Guzambizi Wesonga -vs- Republic [ 1943] 15 EACA 65 where it was held;

15.
The deceased herein was found to have died from severe anaemia due to severe acute lower gastro-intestinal tract bleeding. There was excessive bleeding in the stomach. It is not in dispute that the deceased lived with the accused herein who is his second wife after he had divorced his first wife. It is also not in dispute that the accused and deceased were blessed with five children. It is also not in dispute that the deceased had been ailing and had suffered several illnesses such as stroke, diabetes, ulcers etc. It was the evidence of the deceased’s daughter Martha Akasa Barasa ( PW3) and son Barasa Nato Teka (Pw4) that their father used to suffer from ulcers and used to bleed frequently. It is also not in dispute that the deceased used to take herbal concoctions administered by a traditional herbalist Selina Nanyama Mandila ( PWI) for a long period and up to the time of his death. It transpired from the evidence of the prosecution and defence that the accused herein who is the second wife of the deceased has not been on good terms with the deceased’s first wife and her family. It can be seen by the fact that the accused was shoved aside during the hospitalization of the deceased and who did not participate in the entire process save only at the initial period when she rushed the deceased to hospital for treatment. It also transpired that the dispute between the accused and her co- wife relates to the distribution of the estate of the deceased and which dispute still persists to date. It also transpired that an inquest had been initiated at Kimilili law courts vide inquest No. 13 of 2018 which proceeded briefly but was withdrawn at the behest of the prosecution and subsequently the present charge was preferred against the accused herein. Hence, the inquest was not concluded as regards the cause of death and the identity of the persons involved and or suspected to be behind the death of the deceased. It is the contention of the defence that the traditional herbalist (PW1) should have been taken to task over the death of the deceased since she was the one who prepared the herbal concoction and administered it to the deceased. The accused in her defence stated that the herbalist prepared the concoction and gave it to the deceased and requested her to let him drink the rest of the fluid in aplastic water container. The accused has vehemently denied harming her husband with whom they had five children and whom she cared after the first wife divorced him. According to the investigating officer (PW5), he charged the accused herein because she was the only person living with the deceased and that she did not give him a plausible explanation as to how the deceased met his death. It was further the defence contention that if poison was detected, then the same was the work of her brother in-law who took charge of the deceased and locked her out of the picture. The accused in her defence stated that she did not participate in the prescription of the herbal concoction that the deceased consumed for a long period before he died. It is the accused’s contention that the recovered herbal concoction must have been tempered with during the handling process and that it is her contention that her co- wife and brother in-law ( PW2) were behind it as they were out to fix her. It is also instructive that the proposal to conduct an inquest was informed by that fact that there was no direct evidence regarding the cause of death and the identity of the perpetrator. This fact of conducting an inquest was a clear indication that the cause of death and Identity of the perpetrator had not been established at the time and hence the conclusion that there was no foul play at the time. The prosecution should have allowed the inquest proceedings to be concluded before taking further action. It would appear to me that the introduction of the pesticide into the equation led to the present charges. The prosecution has not explained as to why it had proposed to conduct an inquest which it did half way then abandoned it without allowing the court to come up with a finding. This seems to raise some suspicions on the part of the prosecution and which thus bolsters the accused’s contention that the issue of the pesticide was introduced much later. Hence, I find that the issue of malice aforethought (unlawfulness) of the death has not been established by the prosecution. It is instructive that even the traditional herbalist (PWI) who used to give the deceased herbal concoction was not ordered to record a statement under inquiry or made a suspect in this case. The entire evidence did not disclose that the accused had the requisite malice aforethought. What emerged is a supremacy war between the accused and her co-wife plus her brother in-law over the manner in which the estate of the deceased should be shared among the beneficiaries. Consequently, I find that the prosecution has not proved the ingredient of malice aforethought against the accused herein.






16.
As to the identity of the accused as the perpetrator , the accused has vehemently denied ever harming the deceased who was her husband of many years with whom they had five children. The accused in her defence evidence confirmed that the deceased used to take herbal concoction prescribed by the traditional herbalist (PWI) as the deceased used to suffer from several ailments such as hypertension, diabetes, and ulcers. The evidence of the deceased’s daughter (PW3) and deceased’s son Barasa Nato Teka (Pw4) is that the deceased used to suffer from ulcers and used to bleed frequently. Hence, the issue of bleeding by the deceased was a normal occurrence. The postmortem report indicated the cause of death as severe anaemia due to severe acute lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. This seems to support the evidence of the deceased’s daughter (PW3) and deceased’s son (Pw4). The introduction of a pesticide by the analyst (pw7) raises some doubts as to how the same happened yet the prosecution had proposed to conduct an inquest into the cause of the death only for it to withdraw it mid-way. It is highly likely that the issue of the pesticide was later introduced into the picture with a view to nailing the accused as the fall guy since she and her co – wife plus her in-laws had not been getting along well prior to the death of the deceased. Looking at the circumstances of the incident even though the accused had been living with the deceased, the circumstantial evidence does not at all infer any guilt on her part. In the case of Sawe -vs R (2003) KLR 364 , the Court of Appeal held:-
“
In order to justify on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other hypothesis than that of his guilt. There must be no other co-existing circumstances weakening the chain of circumstances relied upon. The burden of proof in facts that justify the drawing of this inference from the facts to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis of innocence remains with the prosecution. It is a burden which never shifts to the party accused”.
It transpired from the evidence that the deceased and accused had lived together peacefully for a very long period and that the deceased used to take the herbal concoctions for his ailments without any issues. It is only after the deceased fell seriously ill and rushed to hospital that is when her co- wife and brother in-law appeared at the scene and shoved off the accused from further handling the deceased. The accused in her defence had categorically maintained that her co-wife and brother in-law (PW2) must have introduced the issue of the pesticide so as to fix her and thereafter lock her from inheriting the estate of the deceased. I find the circumstantial evidence that has been presented does not infer any guilty on the accused herein since there were many persons who handled the deceased prior to his demise. There is some doubt created in the entire evidence as to the involvement of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. I find that the benefit of such doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused since the evidence as a whole has neither linked her as the perpetrator nor placed her at the scene of crime.






17.
In view of the foregoing observations, it is my finding that the prosecution has not proved its case against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt. I find the accused herein Emily Mukhwana Wanjekeche not guilty of the offence of murder. She is accordingly acquitted of the same. She is hereby set at liberty forthwith unless otherwise lawfully held.

Judgment










1.
The present proceedings commenced through the tenant’s reference Tenant filed a Reference on 27
th
 August, 2020, challenging a notice allegedly issued by the landlord on 30th July 2020.






2.
The parties had filed numerous interlocutory applications which have been dispensed with and the Tribunal set down the hearing of the reference. Each of the parties called witnesses who testified in support of their respective positions as summarized below:






Tenant’s case:


3.
The tenant stated they entered into a lease with one Leah Mukami in 2005 which allowed them to set up their butchery business. The lease was reduced into writing in 2010 and that he has been paying rent as when it falls due and complying with other contractual obligations which formed part of the lease.






4.
During cross- examination, he maintained that there existed a tenancy relationship between them and Leah Mukami. He stated that there had been oral threats to evict them from the demised premises. He maintained that he had never occupied Monicah’s space.






5.
The tenant stated that the space they were occupying belonged to the said Leah Mukami and were commercial. The respondent herein was therefore not their landlord. They therefore prayed for the reference to be allowed as prayed.








Respondent’s case


6.
The respondent stated that she did not know Mohamed and there was no relationship between them. She confirmed that he was let the premises by one Leah Mukami but had encroached into her premises. She averred that she had made attempts to rectify the title but the process was taking long.






7.
During cross examination she confirmed that her advocate had written to the tenant asking him to clear the rent but wondered under what premises he had made the demand. She also confirmed that she sent auctioneers to move Mohamed and erected a wall at the back. She stated that she undertook this in compliance with the orders issued by Justice Omondi.








Analysis


8.
The parties upon closing their respective cases filed submissions in support of the evidence tendered. I have considered the evidence on record and the submissions filed and wish to proceed as follows:






9.
The key issues for determination are whether there exists a tenancy relationship between the parties herein and subsequently whether the reference is merited.






10.
On the first issue, it is prudent to restate that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is circumscribed under section 2(1) of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishment) Act that the tribunal can only adjudicate on disputes emanating from controlled tenancies. A controlled tenancy is defined as a tenancy of a shop, hotel or catering establishment which has been reduced into writing and which is for a period not exceeding five years.






11.
The Supreme Court in its advisory opinion, In the Matter of advisory opinion of the Supreme Court, Constitutional Applicati
on No. 2 of 2011
, restated the principle in the “Motor Vessel “Lillian S case”, in the following terms –
“
The “Lillian S” case [1989] KLR, establishes that jurisdiction flows from law and the recipient court is to apply the same with any limitation embodied therein. Such a court may not arrogate to itself jurisdiction through craft of interpretation or by way of endeavor to discern or interpret the intention of Parliament where the wording of legislation is clear and there is no ambiguity”.






12.
The preamble to the 
Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act
, reads as follows: -“An Act of Parliament to make provision with respect to certain premises for the protection of tenants of such premises from eviction or from exploitation and for matters connected there with and incidental thereto.”






13.
The tribunal’s construction of the title of this Act together with the content of the preamble (supra) is that, this Act deals specifically with the landlord and tenant relationships in relation to structures standing on the land. The mandate to resolve disputes arising from dealings in relation to such structures is exclusively vested in the Business Premises and Rent Tribunal in terms of section 12 of the Act.






14.
Section 12(4) of cap 301, Laws of Kenya confers this tribunal jurisdiction to investigate any complaint relating to a controlled tenancy made to it by the landlord/tenant and make such order thereon as it deems fit. As such, the first qualification as earlier observed is that there must be in existence a landlord and tenant relationship.






15.
The present proceedings were instituted to challenge a purported notice issued by the respondent herein. The respondent has denied ever issuing such a notice. The tenant has also relied upon the other pieces of evidence to prove that there have been threats by the landlord who has previously issued demands through her advocates.






16.
It is clear that there was a dispute between the respondent and the original landlord on the ownership of the demised premises, a matter which has been litigated upon in other courts. The questions of ownership cannot be determined by this Tribunal as the same do not fall within the purview of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.






17.
The landlord has failed to demonstrate the exact point at which the tenant encroached her property. She has admitted to having proceeded with evictions while the titling documentation was in place. There is no reference to any lawful application made in support of such a drastic action. The auctioneer who was engaged proceeded on the same compromised path whose foundation was quick sand.






18.
The issuance of the notice even though denied, if considered against the other facts which have been admitted to by the landlord including the fact that she procured the services of an auctioneer to commence eviction clearly shows that the tenant was justified in approaching the Tribunal. The reference filed was therefore merited.






19.
In the circumstances, the reference dated 27
th
 August, 2020 is allowed with costs awarded to the tenant assessed at Kshs. 100,000/-. The notice of termination dated 30
th
 July, 2020 is quashed for being a nullity.
